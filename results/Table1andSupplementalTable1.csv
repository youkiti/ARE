1,2061,Performance of a qualitative rapid chromatographic immunoassay to diagnose COVID-19 in patients in a middle-income country,"OBJECTIVES: We evaluated a rapid chromatographic immunoassay (IgG/IgM antibodies) and an ELISA assay to diagnose COVID-19 in patient sat two Brazilian hospitals. METHODS: A total of 122 subjects with COVID-19 were included: 106 SARS-COV-2 RT-PCR-positive patients and 16 RT-PCR-negative patients with symptoms and chest computed tomography (CT) consistent with COVID-19. Ninety-six historical blood donation samples were used as controls. Demographic and clinical characteristics were retrieved from electronic records. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated, as were their 95% binomial confidence intervals using the Clopper-Pearson method. All analyses were performed in R version 3.6.3. RESULTS: The sensitivity of the chromatographic immunoassay in all RT-PCR-positive patients, irrespective of the timing of symptom onset, was 85.8% (95% binomial CI 77.7% to 91.9%). This increased with time after symptom onset, and at >14 days was 94.9% (85.9% to 98.9%). The specificity was 100% (96.4% to 100%). 15/16 (94%) RT- PCR-negative cases tested positive. The most frequent comorbidities were hypertension and diabetes mellitus and the most frequent symptoms were fever, cough, and dyspnea. All RT-PCR-negative patients had pneumonia. The most frequent thoracic CT findings were ground glass changes (n=11, 68%), which were bilateral in 9 (56%) patients, and diffuse reticulonodular infiltrates (n=5, 31%). CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 rapid chromatographic immunoassay evaluated in this study had a high sensitivity and specificity using plasma, particularly after 14 days from symptom onset. ELISA and qualitative rapid chromatographic immunoassays can be used for the diagnosis of RT-PCR-negative patients. Copyright Â© 2020 Elsevier B.V.

2,53145,Brain tissue damage in dementia with Lewy bodies: an in vivo diffusion tensor MRI study.,The aim of the present study was to apply diffusion tensor MRI (DT-MRI)  a quantitative MRI measure which reflects tissue organization  to dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). DT-MRI scans were obtained from 15 patients with probable DLB and 10 sex- and age-matched healthy controls. Abnormalities were found in the corpus callosum  pericallosal areas and the frontal  parietal  occipital and  less prominently  temporal white matter of patients compared with controls. Abnormalities were also found in the caudate nucleus and the putamen. The average grey matter volume was lower in patients than in controls. These findings of concomitant grey matter atrophy and white matter abnormalities (as detected by DT-MRI) in regions with a high prevalence of long connecting fibre tracts might suggest the presence of neurodegeneration involving associative cortices. The modest involvement of the temporal lobe fits with the relative preservation of global neuropsychological measures and memory tasks in the early stage of DLB. The selective involvement of parietal  frontal and occipital lobes might explain some of the clinical and neuropsychological features of DLB  providing a possible distinctive marker for this disease. The abnormalities found in the subcortical grey matter may indicate that DLB and Parkinson's disease share a similar nigrostriatal involvement caused by common pathophysiological mechanisms.,1,Brain tissue damage in dementia with Lewy bodies: an in vivo diffusion tensor MRI study.The aim of the present study was to apply diffusion tensor MRI (DT-MRI)  a quantitative MRI measure which reflects tissue organization  to dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB).

4,20581,Pattern of brain atrophy rates in autopsy-confirmed dementia with Lewy bodies.,Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is characterized by preserved whole brain and medial temporal lobe volumes compared with Alzheimer's disease dementia (AD) on magnetic resonance imaging. However  frequently coexistent AD-type pathology may influence the pattern of regional brain atrophy rates in DLB patients. We investigated the pattern and magnitude of the atrophy rates from 2 serial MRIs in autopsy-confirmed DLB patients (n = 20) and mixed DLB/AD patients (n = 22)  compared with AD (n = 30) and elderly nondemented control subjects (n = 15)  followed antemortem. DLB patients without significant AD-type pathology were characterized by lower global and regional rates of atrophy  similar to control subjects. The mixed DLB/AD patients displayed greater atrophy rates in the whole brain  temporoparietal cortices  hippocampus and amygdala  and ventricle expansion  similar to AD patients. In the DLB and DLB/AD patients  the atrophy rates correlated with Braak neurofibrillary tangle stage  cognitive decline  and progression of motor symptoms. Global and regional atrophy rates are associated with AD-type pathology in DLB  and these rates can be used as biomarkers of AD progression in patients with LB pathology.,1,Pattern of brain atrophy rates in autopsy-confirmed dementia with Lewy bodies.Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is characterized by preserved whole brain and medial temporal lobe volumes compared with Alzheimer's disease dementia (AD) on magnetic resonance imaging.

7,49833,Prospective study comparing deep-throat saliva with other respiratory tract specimens in the diagnosis of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19),"BACKGROUND: Self-collected specimens has been advocated to avoid infectious exposure to healthcare workers. Self-induced sputum in those with a productive cough, and saliva in those without a productive cough have been proposed, but sensitivity remains uncertain. METHODS: We performed a prospective study in two regional hospitals in Hong Kong. RESULTS: We prospectively examined 563 serial samples collected during the virus shedding periods of 50 patients: 150 deep-throat saliva (DTS), 309 pooled-nasopharyngeal (NP) and throat swabs, and 104 sputum. DTS had the lowest overall RT-PCR positive rate (68.7% vs. 89.4% [sputum] and 80.9% [pooled NP and throat swabs]), and the lowest viral RNA concentration (mean log copy/mL 3.54 vs. 5.03 [sputum] and 4.63 [pooled NP and throat swabs]). Analyses with respect to time from symptom onset and severity also revealed similar results. Virus yield of DTS correlated with that of sputum (Pearson correlation index [95% CI]: 0.76 [0.62 - 0.86]). We estimated the overall false-negative rate of DTS could be 31.3%, and increased 2.7 times among patients without sputum. CONCLUSION: DTS produced the lowest viral RNA concentration and RT-PCR positive rate compared to conventional respiratory specimens in all phases of illness. Self-collect sputum should be the choice for patients with sputum. Copyright Â© The Author(s) 2020. Published by Oxford University Press for the Infectious Diseases Society of America.

8,19262,COVID-19 detection in CT images with deep learning: A voting-based scheme and cross-datasets analysis,"Early detection and diagnosis are critical factors to control the COVID-19 spreading. A number of deep learning-based methodologies have been recently proposed for COVID-19 screening in CT scans as a tool to automate and help with the diagnosis. These approaches, however, suffer from at least one of the following problems: (i) they treat each CT scan slice independently and (ii) the methods are trained and tested with sets of images from the same dataset. Treating the slices independently means that the same patient may appear in the training and test sets at the same time which may produce misleading results. It also raises the question of whether the scans from the same patient should be evaluated as a group or not. Moreover, using a single dataset raises concerns about the generalization of the methods. Different datasets tend to present images of varying quality which may come from different types of CT machines reflecting the conditions of the countries and cities from where they come from. In order to address these two problems, in this work, we propose an Efficient Deep Learning Technique for the screening of COVID-19 with a voting-based approach. In this approach, the images from a given patient are classified as group in a voting system. The approach is tested in the two biggest datasets of COVID-19 CT analysis with a patient-based split. A cross dataset study is also presented to assess the robustness of the models in a more realistic scenario in which data comes from different distributions. The cross-dataset analysis has shown that the generalization power of deep learning models is far from acceptable for the task since accuracy drops from 87.68% to 56.16% on the best evaluation scenario. These results highlighted that the methods that aim at COVID-19 detection in CT-images have to improve significantly to be considered as a clinical option and larger and more diverse datasets are needed to evaluate the methods in a realistic scenario.

9,22943,Specificity and positive predictive value of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid amplification testing in a low prevalence setting,"OBJECTIVES: When SARS-CoV-2 prevalence is low, many positive test results are false positives. Confirmatory testing reduces overdiagnosis and nosocomial infection and enables real-world estimates of test specificity and positive predictive value. This study estimates these parameters to evaluate the impact of confirmatory testing, and to improve clinical diagnosis, epidemiological estimation and interpretation of vaccine trials. METHODS: Over one month, we took all respiratory samples from our laboratory with a patient's first detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA (Hologic Aptima SARS-CoV-2 assay or in-house RT-PCR platform), and repeated testing using two platforms. Samples were categorised by source, and by whether clinical details suggested COVID-19 or corroborative testing from another laboratory. We estimated specificity and positive predictive value using maximum likelihood-based approaches. RESULTS: Of 19,597 samples, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in 107. 52 corresponded to first-time detection (0.27% of tests on samples without previous detection); further testing detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA >=1 time (""confirmed"") in 29 (56%), and failed to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA (""not confirmed"") in 23 (44%). Depending upon assumed parameters, point estimates for specificity and positive predictive value were 99.91%-99.98% and 61.8%-89.8% respectively using the Hologic Aptima SARS-CoV-2 assay, and 97.4%-99.1% and 20.1%-73.8% respectively using an in-house assay. CONCLUSIONS: Nucleic acid amplification testing for SARS-CoV-2 is highly specific. Nevertheless, when prevalence is low a significant proportion of initially positive results fail to confirm and confirmatory testing substantially reduces false positive detections. Omitting additional testing in samples with higher prior detection probabilities focuses testing where clinically impactful and minimises delay. Copyright Â© 2020.

11,52287,Monitoring pediatric inflammatory bowel disease-a retrospective analysis of transabdominal ultrasound,"BACKGROUND: Poorly controlled inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in children can lead to long- term complications in adulthood. There is a need for an imaging modality to effectively monitor IBD in the pediatric population. The current gold standard, ileocolonoscopy, requires anesthesia in children. Computed tomography (CT) is associated with a risk of radiation and is not recommended for repeated use. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has proven to be effective, but may have limited availability. Transabdominal ultrasound is accessible, safe and well-tolerated in children; however, data to support its effectiveness in monitoring pediatric IBD is limited. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of our study was to evaluate the accuracy and reliability of ultrasound (US) in the detection and monitoring of inflammation in pediatric IBD. DESIGN/METHODS: 57 children were retrospectively included from an established database of children with IBD, and cross-referenced with Picture Archiving and Communication (PACs) database. Patients that had endoscopy and sonography within 60 days were included for comparison. Ultrasound parameters included: bowel wall thickness, mesenteric fat, hyperemia and lymphadenopathy. The weighted kappa statistic was calculated to assess agreement between sonographic and endoscopic findings. Using ordinal logistic regression and proportional odds models, a grey-scale ultrasound (US) score was created to using parameters that best predict disease activity, compared to gold standard endoscopy. RESULTS: There was moderate agreement in disease severity between sonographic and endoscopic findings (weight kappa=0.55). Significant clinical predictors of pediatric IBD disease severity were bowel wall thickness and hyperemia (P<0.05). According to this novel scoring system, 66% of patients were classified correctly, disease severity was under-estimated in 14% of patients and over-estimated in 17% of patients. The AUC was 90% for normal versus active disease. Additional analysis will be conducted with 76 patients from the same database. CONCLUSION: The parameters bowel wall thickness and hyperemia best predict disease severity in children with IBD. These parameters can be combined into an accurate predictive score, effective in the detection of inflammatory activity in children with inflammatory bowel disease.",1,"Monitoring pediatric inflammatory bowel disease-a retrospective analysis of transabdominal ultrasoundBACKGROUND: Poorly controlled inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in children can lead to long- term complications in adulthood. There is a need for an imaging modality to effectively monitor IBD in the pediatric population. The current gold standard, ileocolonoscopy, requires anesthesia in children. Computed tomography (CT) is associated with a risk of radiation and is not recommended for repeated use. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has proven to be effective, but may have limited availability. Transabdominal ultrasound is accessible, safe and well-tolerated in children; however, data to support its effectiveness in monitoring pediatric IBD is limited. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of our study was to evaluate the accuracy and reliability of ultrasound (US) in the detection and monitoring of inflammation in pediatric IBD. DESIGN/METHODS: 57 children were retrospectively included from an established database of children with IBD, and cross-referenced with Picture Archiving and Communication (PACs) database. Patients that had endoscopy and sonography within 60 days were included for comparison. Ultrasound parameters included: bowel wall thickness, mesenteric fat, hyperemia and lymphadenopathy. The weighted kappa statistic was calculated to assess agreement between sonographic and endoscopic findings. Using ordinal logistic regression and proportional odds models, a grey-scale ultrasound (US) score was created to using parameters that best predict disease activity, compared to gold standard endoscopy. RESULTS: There was moderate agreement in disease severity between sonographic and endoscopic findings (weight kappa=0.55).

13,53961,Early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease associated with dementia using cerebral perfusion SPECT.,BACKGROUND: Since patterns of cognitive dysfunction in mild Parkinson's disease associated with dementia (PDD) are similar to those in mild Alzheimer's disease (AD)  it is difficult to accurately differentiate between these two types of dementia in their early phases using neuropsychological tests. The purpose of the current study was to investigate differences in cerebral perfusion patterns of patients with AD and PDD at the earliest stages using single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). METHODS: We consecutively recruited 31 patients with mild PDD  32 patients with mild probable AD and 33 age-matched healthy subjects. All subjects underwent (99m)Tc-hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime perfusion SPECT and completed general neuropsychological tests. RESULTS: We found that both mild PDD and AD patients showed distinct hypoperfusion in frontal  parietal and temporal regions  compared with healthy subjects. More importantly  hypoperfusion in occipital and cerebellar regions was observed only in mild PDD. CONCLUSION: The observation of a significant decrease in cerebral perfusion in occipital and cerebellar regions in patients with mild PDD is likely useful to differentiate between PDD and AD at the earliest stages.,1,Early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease associated with dementia using cerebral perfusion SPECT.BACKGROUND: Since patterns of cognitive dysfunction in mild Parkinson's disease associated with dementia (PDD) are similar to those in mild Alzheimer's disease (AD)  it is difficult to accurately differentiate between these two types of dementia in their early phases using neuropsychological tests.

15,20631,Contrast-enhanced bowel ultrasound in patients with ulcerative colitis,"Introduction: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the bowel that necessitates thorough disease activity monitoring to provide an optimal treatment strategy. Colonoscopy is considered to be a gold standard method for mucosal healing assessment, although the method is invasive and not the most comfortable for a patient. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) is a promising non-invasive method of bowel wall evaluation. Aims and Methods: Our aim was to estimate relation between endoscopic activity of UC and quantitative CEUS parameters. During a period from November 2016 to March 2018 45 patients with known UC were recruited into our study. Abdominal CEUS of the bowel (contrast agent - sulfur hexafluoride) with a linear transducer was performed in each patient. The acquired video-loops were processed on a computer work-station with an application Philips QLab. Region of interest including all the layers of the bowel was chosen. The application delivered a time-intensity-curve (TIC) as well as a fitted curve and TIC parameters. The latter were compared with endoscopic activity (Schroeder score) in a bowel segment examined with CEUS. Statistical analysis was carried out using Statistica 8.0 software. Results: 39 patients were taken for the final analysis, in 7 patients the quality of CEUS data turned out to be inappropriate for quantitative analysis. 4 patients had endoscopic remission (Schroeder 0), 13 had mild disease (Schroeder 1), 15 - moderate disease (Schroeder 2), 7 - severe disease (Schroeder 3). Statistical analysis revealed a significant correlation between volume parameters (area under TIC, peak intensity) and endoscopic activity (Pearson correlation coefficient - 0.6 for AUC and 0.531 for PI, p<0.05).

Recently  elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tau protein levels have been reported to be associated with shorter survival in clinically diagnosed DLB. Correlations between CSF biomarkers and neuropathological findings in DLB are missing. The aim of this study was to investigate correlations between CSF biomarker levels and histopathological findings  with a focus on concomitant Alzheimer pathology  in neuropathologically verified DLB cases. METHODS: The extent of neurofibrillary pathology (Braak stage)  neuritic plaques (CERAD stage)  Alzheimer pathology (PPAD9 stage) and cerebral amyloid angiopathy was assessed in 16 cases with DLB in whom total tau (T-tau)  hyperphosphorylated tau and amyloid beta 1-42 (Aﾎｲ42) protein levels in CSF had been analyzed in vivo. Demographic and clinical data were collected. RESULTS: Both Braak and PPAD9 stages were inversely correlated with Aﾎｲ42 levels  whereas CERAD stage showed no significant correlations. Cerebral amyloid angiopathy correlated positively with T-tau and T-tau/Aﾎｲ42 ratio  and inversely with Aﾎｲ42 levels  but the group showed a very heterogeneous extent of cerebral amyloid angiopathy.

17,52053,Superiority of 18F-FDG PET compared to 111In-labelled leucocyte scintigraphy in the evaluation of fever of unknown origin,AIM: To compare the accuracy of positron emission tomography (PET) using (18)F-FDG (Fluorodeoxyglucose) PET with (111)In-labelled leucocytes scintigraphy (LS) in patients with fever of unknown origin (FUO). METHODS: Twenty-three consecutive patients with FUO were prospectively studied using whole-body LS and PET. Performance of the two modalities for identifying a cause of FUO was evaluated. Final diagnosis was based on biopsy  microbiological tests  clinical and imaging follow-up. RESULTS: Abnormal tracer uptake was seen in 3/23(13%) and 14/23(61%) patients on LS and PET respectively  suggesting a higher sensitivity (p < 0.01) for the latter. All LS positive cases were identified on PET and confirmed as infection. The causes of FUO in the other PET positive patients were: infection (n = 3)  vasculitis (n = 3)  non-infectious inflammatory conditions (n = 2) and cancer (n = 1). No specific diagnosis was reached in 2 patients. Of 13 patients without a definite diagnosis following PET and LS  10 made a spontaneous recovery during the follow-up period and no definite cause for FUO was found on investigation. Still's disease  Polymyalgia rheumatica and Chronic fatigue syndrome/Myalgic encephalomyelitis were diagnosed in the remaining three patients during follow-up. The results thus showed an overall sensitivity of 86% for PET and 20% for LS (p < 0.01). The overall specificity for FDG PET was 78% as against 100% for LS. PET had a PPV of 86% and a NPV of 78% whereas LS had a PPV of 100% and a NPV of 40%. CONCLUSION: PET has a higher sensitivity than LS in identifying the aetiology of FUO.

21,6590,A multiplex microsphere IgG assay for SARS-CoV-2 using ACE2-mediated inhibition as a surrogate for neutralization,"The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the challenges inherent to the serological detection of a novel pathogen such as SARS-CoV-2. Serological tests can be used diagnostically and for surveillance, but their usefulness depends on their throughput, sensitivity and specificity. Here, we describe a multiplex fluorescent microsphere-based assay, 3Flex, that can detect antibodies to three major SARS-CoV-2 antigens-spike (S) protein, the spike ACE2 receptor-binding domain (RBD), and nucleocapsid (NP). Specificity was assessed using 213 pre-pandemic samples.

Serological tests can be used diagnostically and for surveillance, but their usefulness depends on their throughput, sensitivity and specificity. Here, we describe a multiplex fluorescent microsphere-based assay, 3Flex, that can detect antibodies to three major SARS-CoV-2 antigens-spike (S) protein, the spike ACE2 receptor-binding domain (RBD), and nucleocapsid (NP). Specificity was assessed using 213 pre-pandemic samples. Sensitivity was measured and compared to the Abbottâƒ ARCHITECTâƒ SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay using serum samples from 125 unique patients equally binned (n = 25) into 5 time intervals (â‰¤5, 6 to 10, 11 to 15, 16 to 20, and â‰¥21 days from symptom onset).

We aimed to systematically review the quality and reliability of available ultrasound [US] indices compared with reference standards for grading disease activity in IBD patients. Methods: Pubmed, Embase and Medline were searched for relevant literature published within the period 1990 to June 2017. Relevant publications were identified through full text review after initial screening by two investigators. Data on methodology and index characteristics were collected. Study quality was assessed using a modified version of the Quadas-2 tool for risk of bias assessment. Results: Of 20 studies with an US index, 11 studies met the inclusion criteria. Out of these 11 studies, 7 and 4 studied Crohn's disease [CD] and ulcerative colitis [UC0 activity indices, respectively. Parameters that were used in these indices included bowel wall thickness [BWT], Doppler signal [DS], wall layer stratification [WLS], compressibility, peristalsis, haustrations, fatty wrapping, contrast enhancement [CE], and strain pattern. Study quality was graded high in 5 studies, moderate in 3 studies and low in 3 studies. Ileocolonoscopy was used as the reference standard in 9 studies.

24,62414,Challenges in use of saliva for detection of SARS CoV-2 RNA in symptomatic outpatients,"BACKGROUND: A major expansion in SARS CoV-2 testing is urgently needed. Saliva is an attractive option as an alternative for nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS), since saliva can be self-collected, is non-invasive, and sample quality is not dependent on the expertise of the collector. OBJECTIVE: To compare SARS CoV-2 positivity on paired NPS and saliva samples. STUDY DESIGN: NPS and paired saliva samples were prospectively collected from symptomatic outpatients suspected of having COVID-19 and were tested by real-time RT-PCR. RESULTS: In total, 35/124 (26.6 %) samples were RT-PCR positive, with 33/35 positive by NPS (sensitivity=94.3 % (95 % CI 81.4%-99.0%)) and 30/35 by pure saliva (sensitivity=85.7 % (95 % CI 70.6%-93.7%)), for an overall agreement of 117/124 (94.4 %). The median cycle threshold value was significantly lower for NPS than for saliva (p=0.0331). A third or more of pure saliva samples from symptomatic patients were thick, stringy, and difficult to pipet. CONCLUSIONS: Real-time RT-PCR of pure saliva had an overall sensitivity for SARS CoV-2 RNA detection of 85.7 % when compared to simultaneously collected NPS.

Distinct roles for parahippocampal and retrosplenial cortices in place recognition.,A key component of spatial navigation is the ability to use visual information to ascertain where one is located and how one is oriented in the world. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine the neural correlates of this phenomenon in humans. Subjects were scanned while retrieving different kinds of topographical and nontopographical information in response to visual scenes. In the three critical conditions  they viewed images of a familiar college campus  and reported either the location of the place depicted in the image (location task)  the compass direction that the camera was facing when the image was taken (orientation task)  or whether the location was on campus or not (familiarity task). Our analyses focused on the retrosplenial cortex (RSC)/parietal-occipital sulcus region and the parahippocampal place area (PPA)  which previous studies indicate play a critical role in place recognition. RSC activity depended on the type of information retrieved  with the strongest response in the location task. In contrast  PPA activity did not depend on the retrieval task. Additional analyses revealed a strong effect of familiarity in RSC but not in the PPA  with the former region responding much more strongly to images of the familiar campus than to images of an unfamiliar campus. These results suggest that the PPA and RSC play distinct but complementary roles in place recognition. In particular  the PPA may primarily support perception of the immediate scene  whereas RSC may support memory retrieval mechanisms that allow the scene to be localized within the broader spatial environment.,0,Where am I now?

Prevention is of paramount importance to contain its spread. This study observes face mask wearing behavior and contact transmission problems in Taiwan. Teachers track student status in class. In addition to measuring body temperature and regular disinfection, classrooms require ventilation wear mask, provide alcohol spray and avoid sharing the microphone. Both questionnaire surveys and experimental were utilized. A total of 160 adults residing in Taiwan participated in the survey. The dye simulated the possible virus area on the mask surface during usage. Subjects were required to complete a questionnaire and simulate the spread of contact transmission when using a computer. Eighty-one % of respondents reported consistent use of surgical masks several times a day. They reported taking their masks off in relatively safe areas. Most people reported using one mask per day and storing the masks in their pockets. As a result, masks surface become a contamination source. In the contact experiment, ten adults were requested to don and doff a surgical mask while doing a word processing task. The extended contamination areas were recorded and identified by image analysis. The results show an average contamination area of the workspace is significant 530 cm2.

37,51445,The joint effect of apolipoprotein E epsilon4 and MRI findings on lower-extremity function and decline in cognitive function.,BACKGROUND: Cognitive decline and poor physical function are risk factors for disability in old age and may occur more often in subjects with the apolipoprotein E epsilon4 (ApoE-epsilon4) allele. The objective of this study was to investigate the joint effect of ApoE-epsilon4 and structural changes detected on MRI brain scans on cognitive decline and lower-extremity function. METHODS: Brain MRI (1.5 T)  neuropsychological tests  and lower-extremity physical function tests were administered to World War II male veteran twins ages 69 to 80. Quantification of MRI scans used a previously published algorithm to segment brain images into total cerebral brain (TCB)  cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)  and white-matter hyperintensity (WMH) volumes. A short battery of physical performance tests was used to assess lower-extremity function. Ten-year changes in performance on the Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE)  the Benton Visual Retention Test (BVRT)  and the Digit Symbol Substitution (DSS) test were used to assess cognitive decline. RESULTS: For the sample as a whole  the comparison of subjects by median split of total cerebral brain volume found that those with brain volumes below the median performed worse on tests of gait and balance (p < .01) and experienced greater cognitive decline on the MMSE and BVRT cognitive test batteries (both p < .01). In addition  subjects with WMH volumes above the median had poor performance on the standing balance tasks and experienced greater decline on the DSS test (p < .01). Stratified analyses revealed that the joint effect of radiological findings and the ApoE-epsilon4 allele on cognitive decline and lower-extremity function was often greater than that expected from the separate effects combined. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that radiological findings in conjunction with ApoE-epsilon4 may single out a group at higher risk for dementia. We speculate that the observed interaction effect may be due to increased susceptibility to brain injury or impaired repair mechanisms in subjects with ApoE-epsilon4.,0,The joint effect of apolipoprotein E epsilon4 and MRI findings on lower-extremity function and decline in cognitive function.BACKGROUND: Cognitive decline and poor physical function are risk factors for disability in old age and may occur more often in subjects with the apolipoprotein E epsilon4 (ApoE-epsilon4) allele.

The protein aggregation was primarily achieved by a nonanionic agent 1 1 1 3 3 3-hexafluoro-2-propanol (HFIP)  while the ionic condition was modified by inorganic salts. The aggregation analysis by three spectroscopic methods revealed a two-phase kinetics of the aggregation of tau4RD in the presence of HFIP at approximately 4-6%. Large increases in the light-scattering  the thioflavin-binding  and the secondary structure content of tau4RD have progressed within a few minutes at 37 degrees C  which was followed by another slower aggregation phase. Electron microscopic analysis demonstrated that the amorphous granules are formed in the faster step  which acquired a fibrous shape in the slower step in the solution containing NaCl. In the absence of the salt  however  the fibrous maturation was inhibited. Examination of various salt species in place of NaCl demonstrated that binding of anions to the precursor aggregates was essential for the fibrous maturation. On the basis of the results  we proposed an aggregation scheme of tau in which the formation of a thioflavin-binding intermediate occurred ahead of its fibrous maturation. The anionic environment was suggested to play a crucial role in the fibrous maturation and  therefore  could be an in vivo determinant of the morphology of the aggregates of tau.,0,Anionic contribution for fibrous maturation of protofibrillar assemblies of the human tau repeat domain in a fluoroalcohol solution.Tau protein forms fibrous aggregates in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease.

Methods to compute brain change must be robust to scan quality. Biases may arise if any scans are thrown out  as this can lead to the true changes being overestimated or underestimated. Here we analyzed the full MRI dataset from the first phase of Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI-1) from the first phase of Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI-1) and assessed several sources of bias that can arise when tracking brain changes with structural brain imaging methods  as part of a pipeline for tensor-based morphometry (TBM). In all healthy subjects who completed MRI scanning at screening  6  12  and 24months  brain atrophy was essentially linear with no detectable bias in longitudinal measures. In power analyses for clinical trials based on these change measures  only 39AD patients and 95 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects were needed for a 24-month trial to detect a 25% reduction in the average rate of change using a two-sided test (ﾎｱ=0.05  power=80%).

Since the deposition of beta-amyloid (A beta) in brain represents the first pathogenetic event in the onset of AD  in this study we investigated the role of hypertension in the brain deposition of A beta. We analyzed two independent mouse models of hypertension. In both models we observed an increased permeability of blood-brain barrier in cortex and hippocampus. More interestingly  in the same areas hypertensive mice showed a marked positivity to anti-A beta antibodies and the presence of A beta-like fragments. Finally  we analyzed mice after passive immunotherapy with anti-A beta IgG. We observed that this latter approach determined a markedly reduced A beta immunopositivity in both cortex and hippocampus. Our study demonstrates that chronic hypertension determines an impairment of the blood-brain barrier permeability with deposition of A beta in brain tissue and that passive immunotherapy prevents this latter phenomenon.,0,Beta-amyloid deposition in brain is enhanced in mouse models of arterial hypertension.There are conflicting evidence regarding the association of hypertension with Alzheimer's disease (AD)  and so far it is still unexplored whether increased blood pressure levels can be mechanistically related to the pathophysiology of AD.

41,3992,Examining the multifactorial nature of cognitive aging with covariance analysis of positron emission tomography data.,Research has indicated that there may be age-related and Alzheimer's disease (AD) -related reductions in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in the brain. This study explored differences in age- and AD-related rCBF patterns in the context of cognitive aging using a multivariate approach to the analysis of H215O PET data. First  an rCBF covariance pattern that distinguishes between a group of younger and older adults was identified. Individual subject's expression of the identified age-related pattern was significantly correlated with their performance on tests of memory  even after controlling for the effect of age. This finding suggests that subject expression of the covariance pattern explained additional variation in performance on the memory tasks. The age-related covariance pattern was then compared to an AD-related covariance pattern. There was little evidence that the two covariance patterns were similar  and the age-related pattern did a poor job of differentiating between cognitively-healthy older adults and those with probable AD. The findings from this study are consistent with the multifactorial nature of cognitive aging.,0,Examining the multifactorial nature of cognitive aging with covariance analysis of positron emission tomography data.Research has indicated that there may be age-related and Alzheimer's disease (AD) -related reductions in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in the brain.

44,42185,Warmer weather unlikely to reduce the COVID-19 transmission: An ecological study in 202 locations in 8 countries,"Purpose: To examine the association between meteorological factors (temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and UV radiation) and transmission capacity of COVID-19. Method(s): We collected daily numbers of COVID-19 cases in 202 locations in 8 countries. We matched meteorological data from the NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information. We used a time-frequency approach to examine the possible association between meteorological conditions and basic reproductive number (R0) of COVID-19. We determined the correlations between meteorological factors and R0 of COVID-19 using multiple linear regression models and meta-analysis. We further validated our results using a susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) metapopulation model to simulate the changes of daily cases of COVID-19 in China under different temperatures and relative humidity conditions. Principal results: Temperature did not exhibit significant association with R0 of COVID-19 (meta p = 0.446). Also, relative humidity (meta p = 0.215), wind speed (meta p = 0.986), and ultraviolet (UV) radiation (meta p = 0.491) were not significantly associated with R0 either.

Method(s): We collected daily numbers of COVID-19 cases in 202 locations in 8 countries. We matched meteorological data from the NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information. We used a time-frequency approach to examine the possible association between meteorological conditions and basic reproductive number (R0) of COVID-19. We determined the correlations between meteorological factors and R0 of COVID-19 using multiple linear regression models and meta-analysis. We further validated our results using a susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) metapopulation model to simulate the changes of daily cases of COVID-19 in China under different temperatures and relative humidity conditions. Principal results: Temperature did not exhibit significant association with R0 of COVID-19 (meta p = 0.446). Also, relative humidity (meta p = 0.215), wind speed (meta p = 0.986), and ultraviolet (UV) radiation (meta p = 0.491) were not significantly associated with R0 either.

45,21749,Changes in the (11C-methyl)-L-methionine uptake index in gliomas following radiotherapy,We have studied changes in the (11C-methyl)-L-methionine (C-11 Met) uptake index in six glioma cases subsequent to radiotherapy  using positron emission tomography (PET) to evaluate the effects of radiotherapy on the amino acid metabolism of the tumor. The uptake index of the tumor represented as a percentage of the total count in the atrial blood recorded during a period of 45 min  showed an average of 0.037% and 0.039% prior to and within two months after the therapy  respectively. Out of three cases where a fall in the index was seen  two cases showed tumor regression in the size of the contrast enhanced lesion measured by CT; all three cases had a relatively long period of clinical and neurological amelioration. However  following a short period of clinical improvement  the other three patients with a rise in the index showed no change or tumor progression on CT.

An abscess can involve any of the major viscera, including the liver and spleen. Case Report: A 27-year-old male patient with a 6-month history of NOD2/CARD15-positive Crohn's disease with stenosis of the terminal ileum, previously treated with corticosteroids, was admitted with fever, chills, diarrhea, fatigue and cachexia. Diagnostic work-up revealed sepsis, an abscess in the right hepatic lobe, multiple abdominal collections and right-sided pleural effusion. It was felt that his poor general condition prevented surgical intervention and complex conservative treatment was initiated. It consisted of total parenteral nutrition, antibiotics, percutaneous drainage of the liver abscess, and thoracocentesis. Pus and blood cultures showed Lactobacillus acidophilus. There was a gradual improvement in the patient's condition and the liver abscess decreased in diameter from 14 to 2 cm. Aminosalicylates and enterai nutrition were gradually introduced.

However, the optimal timing of surgery in patients with the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection remains unknown. This case report describes a patient with COVID-19 pneumonia complicated by multiorgan system failure requiring intubation who sustained a femoral neck fracture that required total hip arthroplasty. This patient had a significant, deliberate delay in time to surgical intervention because of his critical state. When deciding the optimal timing for total hip arthroplasty in patients with COVID-19, we recommend using inflammatory markers, such as procalcitonin and interleukin-6, as indicators of disease resolution and caution operative intervention when patients are nearing the 7-10th day of COVID-19 symptoms. Furthermore, implant cementation and spinal anesthesia in critically ill COVID-positive patients should be approached cautiously in the setting of pulmonary disease and multiorgan system failure.

Methods: This is a single-center clinical trial of COVID-19 patients at NYU Winthrop Hospital from March 31 to April 28, 2020. Patients in this trial received hyperbaric oxygen therapy at 2.0 atmospheres of pressure in monoplace hyperbaric chambers for 90 minutes daily for a maximum of five total treatments. Controls were identified using propensity score matching among COVID-19 patients admitted during the same time period. Using competing-risks survival regression, we analyzed our primary outcome of inpatient mortality and secondary outcome of mechanical ventilation. Results: We treated 20 COVID-19 patients with hyperbaric oxygen. Ages ranged from 30 to 79 years with an oxygen requirement ranging from 2 to 15 liters on hospital days 0 to 14. Of these 20 patients, two (10%) were intubated and died, and none remain hospitalized. Among 60 propensity-matched controls based on age, sex, body mass index, coronary artery disease, troponin, D-dimer, hospital day, and oxygen requirement, 18 (30%) were intubated, 13 (22%) have died, and three (5%) remain hospitalized (with one still requiring mechanical ventilation). Assuming no further deaths among controls, we estimate that the adjusted subdistribution hazard ratios were 0.37 for inpatient mortality (p=0.14) and 0.26 for mechanical ventilation (p=0.046). Conclusion: Though limited by its study design, our results demonstrate the safety of hyperbaric oxygen among COVID-19 patients and strongly suggests the need for a well-designed, multicenter randomized control trial.

The records of patients who underwent intraoperative photography and electrophysiologic mapping of SSG and MG were reviewed. Patients were excluded if the perirolandic area was involved with tumor or if the operative exposure did not permit adequate visualization of perirolandic cortex. Twenty-five patients (10 females  15 males  median age 31 years) with varying pathologies met these criteria. Twenty of the 25 craniotomies were performed on the left side. Outlines of the exposed SSG and MG were traced on transparencies  which were then digitized. The areas of the exposed surfaces of SSG and MG were computed in pixels. A ratio (S/M = surface area of exposed SSG/surface area of exposed MG) was computed for each patient. S/M was >1 (surface area of the SSG was larger than the surface area of MG) in 19 of 25 patients (76%). S/M ranged from 0.79 to 1.62 (median 1.18). These data indicate that the exposed surface area of SSG is usually larger than MG (p < 0.01).

56,66223,[11C] methionine and [18F] fluorodeoxyglucose PET in the follow-up of glioblastoma multiforme,BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate the value of [11C] methionine (MET) and [18F] fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET in the follow-up of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). PATIENTS AND METHODS: After surgical and/or conservative treatment  28 patients (pts) with GBM underwent FDG and MET PET on average 12.7 months after the diagnosis had been established. Scans were evaluated visually and by calculating the maximal tumor SUV as well as the ratio of tumor vs. contralateral region (RTu). The degree of tracer uptake was compared with survival time  disease duration and MRI findings. RESULTS: The mean overall duration of survival was 12.7 months. The patients were divided into two groups: those that survived less than 12 months and those that survived longer than 12 months. Focally increased uptake was revealed by MET PET in 24 patients and by FDG PET in 2 patients. On MRI scans  viable tumor tissue was suspected in 18 patients. No correlations were registered between FDG/MET uptake and survival time or disease duration respectively; Kaplan-Meier calculations were negative in this regard. Similarly  negative results were obtained in subgroups of patients who had undergone microsurgical resection and whose disease was at least of 6 months' duration  and additionally in a subgroup who had undergone their last treatment longer than 6 months ago. With respect to survival groups  a positive MET PET was associated with a sensitivity of 86% and a specificity of 8%. SUV and RTu values did not differ between patients with positive or negative MRI results. CONCLUSIONS: In this study FDG PET seems to be of limited value in the work-up of recurrent GBM because of its lower sensitivity than MET PET and the fact that it allows no prediction of the outcome. MET PET visualizes viable tumor tissue without adding any prognostic information and appears to be in no way superior to conventional imaging,0,[11C] methionine and [18F] fluorodeoxyglucose PET in the follow-up of glioblastoma multiformeBACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate the value of [11C] methionine (MET) and [18F] fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET in the follow-up of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). PATIENTS AND METHODS: After surgical and/or conservative treatment  28 patients (pts) with GBM underwent FDG and MET PET on average 12.7 months after the diagnosis had been established. Scans were evaluated visually and by calculating the maximal tumor SUV as well as the ratio of tumor vs. contralateral region (RTu). The degree of tracer uptake was compared with survival time  disease duration and MRI findings. RESULTS: The mean overall duration of survival was 12.7 months. The patients were divided into two groups: those that survived less than 12 months and those that survived longer than 12 months. Focally increased uptake was revealed by MET PET in 24 patients and by FDG PET in 2 patients. On MRI scans  viable tumor tissue was suspected in 18 patients. No correlations were registered between FDG/MET uptake and survival time or disease duration respectively; Kaplan-Meier calculations were negative in this regard. Similarly  negative results were obtained in subgroups of patients who had undergone microsurgical resection and whose disease was at least of 6 months' duration  and additionally in a subgroup who had undergone their last treatment longer than 6 months ago. With respect to survival groups  a positive MET PET was associated with a sensitivity of 86% and a specificity of 8%. SUV and RTu values did not differ between patients with positive or negative MRI results. CONCLUSIONS: In this study FDG PET seems to be of limited value in the work-up of recurrent GBM because of its lower sensitivity than MET PET and the fact that it allows no prediction of the outcome. MET PET visualizes viable tumor tissue without adding any prognostic information and appears to be in no way superior to conventional imaging,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 56}",1,"{'judgement': 'False', 'index': 56}",0,"{'judgement': 'False', 'index': 56}",0,"{'judgement': 'False', 'index': 56}",0,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 56}",1,"{'judgement': 'False', 'index': 56}",0,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 56}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 56}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 56}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 56}",1
57,23260,German bronchoscopy unit readiness for the COVID-19 pandemic: A nationwide survey,"Background: The worldwide impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is unprecedented. Among the aerosol generating procedures, bronchoscopy in particular is an indispensable diagnostic and therapeutic tool that comes with a high risk of infection.

Method(s): We conducted a nationwide survey from 1 April 2020 to 7 April 2020 to which 218 German endoscopy units, 105 solely bronchoscopy and 113 interdisciplinary, responded. The survey was distributed electronically via the German Respiratory Society. Result(s): While 17% of units did not cancel any interventions, 16% cancelled >80% of their interventions. 73% were unable to completely separate high-risk patients.

58,63590,A COVID-19-Based Modified Epidemiological Model and Technological Approaches to Help Vulnerable Individuals Emerge from the Lockdown in the UK,"COVID-19 has shown a relatively low case fatality rate in young healthy individuals, with the majority of this group being asymptomatic or having mild symptoms. However, the severity of the disease among the elderly as well as in individuals with underlying health conditions has caused significant mortality rates worldwide. Understanding this variance amongst different sectors of society and modelling this will enable the different levels of risk to be determined to enable strategies to be applied to different groups. Long-established compartmental epidemiological models like SIR and SEIR do not account for the variability encountered in the severity of the SARS-CoV-2 disease across different population groups. The objective of this study is to investigate how a reduction in the exposure of vulnerable individuals to COVID-19 can minimise the number of deaths caused by the disease, using the UK as a case study. To overcome the limitation of long-established compartmental epidemiological models, it is proposed that a modified model, namely SEIR-v, through which the population is separated into two groups regarding their vulnerability to SARS-CoV-2 is applied. This enables the analysis of the spread of the epidemic when different contention measures are applied to different groups in society regarding their vulnerability to the disease. A Monte Carlo simulation (100,000 runs) along the proposed SEIR-v model is used to study the number of deaths which could be avoided as a function of the decrease in the exposure of vulnerable individuals to the disease. The results indicate a large number of deaths could be avoided by a slight realistic decrease in the exposure of vulnerable groups to the disease. The mean values across the simulations indicate 3681 and 7460 lives could be saved when such exposure is reduced by 10% and 20% respectively. From the encouraging results of the modelling a number of mechanisms are proposed to limit the exposure of vulnerable individuals to the disease.

The clinical, epidemiological, laboratory, treatment and outcome data of patients were evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 75 patients were treated and 56 (74.66%) were men. The clinical spectrum of COVID-19 ranged from asymptomatic to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Fever (85.36%) was the most common symptom followed by cough (56.09%) and dyspnoea (19.51%). Findings from hemogram analysis showed that 32%, 21.33% and 18.67% of patients had lymphopaenia, eosinopenia and thrombocytopaenia, respectively. Inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein, D-dimer, ferritin, fibrin degradation product and interleukin-6 were significantly elevated (P <0.05) in patients who required oxygen therapy than those who did not require it, suggesting the potential role such markers could play in predicting prognosis in patients.

66,23034,Mild cognitive impairment: evaluation with 4-T functional MR imaging.,PURPOSE: To prospectively assess abnormalities in brain activation patterns during encoding and retrieval in subjects with mild cognitive impairment by using 4-T functional magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The institutional review board approved this HIPAA-compliant study; all subjects gave written informed consent. Twenty patients with mild cognitive impairment (12 men  eight women; mean age  75.0 years +/- 7.6 [standard deviation]) and 20 elderly control subjects (nine men  11 women; mean age  71.2 years +/- 4.5) underwent functional MR imaging at 4 T during a novel-versus-familiar face-name encoding-retrieval task. The magnitude of blood oxygen level-dependent brain responses across the entire brain were compared within and between subjects with mild cognitive impairment and control subjects by using a voxelwise random-effects model. A one-sample t test was used for within-group analysis; an analysis-of-covariance model (with age as a covariate) was used for between-group analysis. RESULTS: Brain regions activated by the task (prefrontal  medial temporal  and parietal regions) during encoding were similar to those activated during retrieval  with larger areas activated during retrieval. Subjects with mild cognitive impairment showed decreased magnitude of activation in bilateral frontal cortex regions (during encoding and retrieval)  the left hippocampus (during retrieval)  and the left cerebellum (during encoding) compared with magnitude of activation in control subjects (P < .001). Patients with mild cognitive impairment showed increased activation in the posterior frontal lobes (during retrieval) (P < .001). Lower hippocampal activation during retrieval was the most significant correlate of clinical severity of memory loss in mild cognitive impairment (P < .001). CONCLUSION: A difference exists in the response of brain regions underlying encoding and retrieval in mild cognitive impairment. Memory deficits in mild cognitive impairment may be linked to functional alterations in several specific brain regions both inside and outside the medial temporal lobe.,0,Mild cognitive impairment: evaluation with 4-T functional MR imaging.PURPOSE: To prospectively assess abnormalities in brain activation patterns during encoding and retrieval in subjects with mild cognitive impairment by using 4-T functional magnetic resonance (MR) imaging.

Subjects with mild cognitive impairment showed decreased magnitude of activation in bilateral frontal cortex regions (during encoding and retrieval)  the left hippocampus (during retrieval)  and the left cerebellum (during encoding) compared with magnitude of activation in control subjects (P < .001). Patients with mild cognitive impairment showed increased activation in the posterior frontal lobes (during retrieval) (P < .001). Lower hippocampal activation during retrieval was the most significant correlate of clinical severity of memory loss in mild cognitive impairment (P < .001). CONCLUSION: A difference exists in the response of brain regions underlying encoding and retrieval in mild cognitive impairment. Memory deficits in mild cognitive impairment may be linked to functional alterations in several specific brain regions both inside and outside the medial temporal lobe.,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 66}",1,"{'judgement': 'False', 'index': 66}",0,"{'judgement': 'False', 'index': 66}",0,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 66}",1,"{'judgement': 'False', 'index': 66}",0,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 66}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 66}",1,"{'judgement': 'False', 'index': 66}",0,"{'judgement': 'False', 'index': 66}",0,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 66}",1

As well  these individuals are increasingly experiencing Alzheimer's disease (AD)-like neurocognitive problems and neuropathological features such as increased deposition of amyloid beta (Aﾎｲ) protein. Findings that Aﾎｲ production occurs largely in endolysosomes  that HIV-1 transactivator protein (Tat) disrupts endolysosome function-an early pathological feature of AD-and that HIV-1 Tat can increase Aﾎｲ levels prompted us to test the hypothesis that endolysosome dysfunction is associated with HIV-1 Tat-induced increases in neuronal Aﾎｲ generation. Using primary cultured rat hippocampal neurons  we found that treatment with HIV-1 Tat caused such morphological changes as enlargement of endolysosomes identified with LysoTracker dye and such functional changes as elevated endolysosome pH measured ratiometrically with LysoSensor dye. The HIV-1 Tat-induced changes in endolysosome function preceded temporally HIV-1 Tat-induced increases in Aﾎｲ generation measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In addition  we demonstrated that HIV-1 Tat increased endolysosome accumulation of Aﾎｲ precursor protein and Aﾎｲ identified using immunostaining with 4G8 antibodies. Furthermore  we demonstrated that treatment of neurons with HIV-1 Tat increased endolysosome accumulation of beta amyloid-converting enzyme  the rate-limiting enzymatic step for Aﾎｲ production  and enhanced beta amyloid-converting enzyme activity. Together  our findings suggest that HIV-1 Tat increases neuronal Aﾎｲ generation and thereby contributes to the development of AD-like pathology in HIV-1-infected individuals by disturbing endolysosome structure and function.,0,Endolysosome involvement in HIV-1 transactivator protein-induced neuronal amyloid beta production.The increased life expectancy of people living with HIV-1/AIDS is accompanied by increased prevalence of HIV-1-associated neurocognitive disorder.

72,52211,A three-dimensional human neural cell culture model of Alzheimer's disease.,Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia  characterized by two pathological hallmarks: amyloid-ﾎｲ plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. The amyloid hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease posits that the excessive accumulation of amyloid-ﾎｲ peptide leads to neurofibrillary tangles composed of aggregated hyperphosphorylated tau. However  to date  no single disease model has serially linked these two pathological events using human neuronal cells. Mouse models with familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) mutations exhibit amyloid-ﾎｲ-induced synaptic and memory deficits but they do not fully recapitulate other key pathological events of Alzheimer's disease  including distinct neurofibrillary tangle pathology. Human neurons derived from Alzheimer's disease patients have shown elevated levels of toxic amyloid-ﾎｲ species and phosphorylated tau but did not demonstrate amyloid-ﾎｲ plaques or neurofibrillary tangles. Here we report that FAD mutations in ﾎｲ-amyloid precursor protein and presenilin 1 are able to induce robust extracellular deposition of amyloid-ﾎｲ  including amyloid-ﾎｲ plaques  in a human neural stem-cell-derived three-dimensional (3D) culture system. More importantly  the 3D-differentiated neuronal cells expressing FAD mutations exhibited high levels of detergent-resistant  silver-positive aggregates of phosphorylated tau in the soma and neurites  as well as filamentous tau  as detected by immunoelectron microscopy. Inhibition of amyloid-ﾎｲ generation with ﾎｲ- or ﾎｳ-secretase inhibitors not only decreased amyloid-ﾎｲ pathology  but also attenuated tauopathy. We also found that glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) regulated amyloid-ﾎｲ-mediated tau phosphorylation. We have successfully recapitulated amyloid-ﾎｲ and tau pathology in a single 3D human neural cell culture system. Our unique strategy for recapitulating Alzheimer's disease pathology in a 3D neural cell culture model should also serve to facilitate the development of more precise human neural cell models of other neurodegenerative disorders.,0,A three-dimensional human neural cell culture model of Alzheimer's disease.Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia  characterized by two pathological hallmarks: amyloid-ﾎｲ plaques and neurofibrillary tangles.

Overcrowded and under-resourced healthcare centres have had to design different strategies to treat these patients, what includes the control of the electrocardiogram (ECG), as some drugs that have been used to treat these patients may prolong the QT interval as a side effect. During the COVID-19 outbreak, we designed a protocol for monitoring the QT interval using a portable device with Bluetooth connectivity. After a validation study with 50 patients, we found a very good correlation between the QT interval measured both with this device and with the conventional body surface ECG. In this article, we provide a brief overview of the protocol and then analyse the QT changes observed in a group of patients during their hospitalization and treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infection. 81 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled in the protocol (age 63.4 SD 17.2 years; 70.3% men), while being treated with lopinavir/ritonavir, azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine, both individually or combined. Ten patients developed long drug-related QT interval, and the QT prolongation was statically significant for all treatment schemes, except for lopinavir/ritonavir alone. All patients with drug induced QT prolongation corrected the QT interval following the indications of the protocol, and no patients died of arrhythmic causes after its implementation. In our experience, a protocol for the electrocardiographic monitoring of these patients minimizes the risk of iatrogenic QT interval prolongation and consequently reduces sudden death events, and for that purpose, portable devices like the one used in this protocol may constitute a useful tool to minimize the contact with such patients.

The objective of the present study was to examine perceptions of how weight-related lifestyle changed in social lockdown among UK adults compared with before the emergence of the COVID-19 crisis. Method(s): As part of an online cross-sectional survey conducted during social lockdown in the United Kingdom, 723 UK adults reported on the extent to which their eating (healthiness of diet, frequency of bingeing on food), physical activity, sleep and alcohol consumption had changed since the emergence of the COVID-19 crisis and completed measures of current psychological well-being. Result(s): Although both improvements and declines in weight gain protective behaviours were reported, 79% of participants reported a decline in one or more weight gain protective behaviours. Both participants with a diagnosis of psychiatric illness or obesity (body mass index [BMI] >= 30) were most likely to report declines in weight gain protective behaviours and show an overall profile of weight management behaviours worsening. Participants experiencing high levels of stress also reported reductions in more weight gain protective behaviours. Conclusion(s): Lifestyle behaviours associated with weight gain are likely to have been affected by the COVID-19 crisis.

Thus, the purpose of this study was to investigate the role of self-talk in predicting death anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and coping strategies in the face of COVID-19. Method(s): This descriptive and correlational study was conducted on 354 adults living in Ardabil, Iran, who were selected using cluster sampling from 21 January to 19 March 2020. Self-Talk questionnaires, Coping Strategies, Death Anxiety, and Obsessive-Compulsive questionnaires were used for data collection. Descriptive statistics, Pearson correlation, and multiple linear regression were used for data analysis. Result(s): The findings revealed a significant positive relationship between self-talk and problem-centered coping style. Also, significant negative relationships were found between self-talk and emotional coping style, death anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Furthermore, based on the results of the regression test, self-talk predicted problem-centered style, emotional-coping style, death anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive disorder.

Cough (90.5%) and fever (81.0%) were the dominant symptoms, and most of them (76.2%) had at least one coexisting disorder on admission. The most common characteristics on chest CT were ground-glass opacity (100%) and bilateral patchy shadowing (76.2%). The most common findings on laboratory measurements were lymphocytopenia (85.7%), elevated levels of C-reactive protein (94.7%), and Interleukin-6 (89.5%). The prevalence of anti-52 kDa SSA/Ro antibody, anti-60 kDa SSA/Ro antibody and antinuclear antibody in the cases was 20%, 25% and 50% respectively. In the present work, we retrospectively analyzed the clinical and laboratory data from 21 severe and critical cases with COVID-19. Autoimmune phenomena exist in COVID-19 subjects, and the results provide the rationale for a strategy of prevention of dysfunction of immune and optimal immunosuppressive therapy in the future.

77,5859,Right ventricular pressure-volume loops using simultaneous radionuclide angiography with a multiwire gamma camera and right heart catheterization,BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to generate right ventricular (RV) pressure-volume loops (PVLs) from time-activity curves obtained by first-pass radionuclide angiography (RNA) and RV pressures obtained by right heart catheterization. METHODS AND RESULTS: Short-lived tantalum 178 was used to obtain first-pass RNA at baseline (n = 31)  after nitroglycerin (n = 5)  or after the conclusion of cardiac catheterization (n = 13). From the radionuclide-derived RV ejection fraction and thermodilution stroke volume  the RV end-diastolic volume and end-systolic volume were measured. Special proprietary software was developed and used to integrate the pressure and the RNA data. The mean heart rate was 80 +/- 17 beats/min; RV ejection fraction  39% +/- 12%; RV end-diastolic volume  217 +/- 79 mL; RV end-systolic volume  142 +/- 74 mL; and RV end-diastolic pressure  10 +/- 7 mm Hg. The RV PVLs were of high quality and reproducible. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides proof of concept of the feasibility of generating RV PVL; the short half-life (10 minutes) and low energy (59 keV) of Ta-178 allow the generation of multiple loops at low radiation exposure. Such studies could be performed at the bedside and provide a wealth of information that may have clinical and research merits.,0,Right ventricular pressure-volume loops using simultaneous radionuclide angiography with a multiwire gamma camera and right heart catheterizationBACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to generate right ventricular (RV) pressure-volume loops (PVLs) from time-activity curves obtained by first-pass radionuclide angiography (RNA) and RV pressures obtained by right heart catheterization.

In this study, the magnetic Fe3O4 nanospheres coupled with mouse antihuman IgG (Ab1IgG) were used as an immune capture probe (Fe3O4@Ab1IgG) to capture and separate the target, and rabbit antihuman IgG (Ab2IgG) coupled with highly luminescent quantum dot nanobeads (QBs) as a fluorescence detection probe (QBs@Ab2IgG) was used to realize high sensitivity detection. After the formation of a sandwich immunocomplex, the fluorescence intensity of the precipitate after magnetic separation was measured at the excitation wavelength of 370 nm. Under optimal conditions, a wide linear range varying from 0.005 to 40 ng.mL-1 was obtained for the detection of human IgG with a lower limit of detection at 4 pg.mL-1 (S/N = 3). The recoveries of intra- and interassays were 90.0-101.9 and 96.0-106.6%, respectively, and the relative standard deviations were 6.3-10.2 and 2.6-10.5%, respectively. Furthermore, the proposed method was successfully demonstrated to detect human IgG in serum samples, and the detection results were not statistically different (P > 0.05) from commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits.

79,23817,The Alzheimer pandemic: is paracetamol to blame?,HISTORICAL BACKGROUND: The clinical recognition of a form of dementia closely resembling Alzheimer's disease dates from around 1800. The role of analgesics derived from coal-tar in the spread of the pandemic is traced in terms of the introduction of phenacetin (PN) in 1887; its nephrotoxicity; the observation of lesions characteristic of the disease by Fischer and Alzheimer; the discovery of paracetamol (PA) as the major metabolite of PN; the linking of kidney injury and dementia with high PN usage; and the failure of PN replacement by PA to halt and reverse the exponential  inexorable rise in the incidence of Alzheimer-type dementia. Fischer observed his first case before Alzheimer; it is proposed to rename the syndrome Fischer-Alzheimer disease (F-AD). Disease development: PA-metabolising enzymes are localised in the synaptic areas of the frontal cortex and hippocampus  where F-AD lesions arise. The initiating chemical lesions in liver poisoning comprise covalent binding of a highly reactive product of PA metabolism to proteins; similar events are believed to occur in brain  where alterations in the antigenic profiles of cerebral proteins activate the microglia. ﾎｲ-Amyloid forms  and  like PA itself  induces nitric oxide synthase. Peroxynitrite modifies cerebral proteins by nitrating tyrosine residues  further challenging the microglia and exacerbating the amyloid cascade.

80,32712,Tau accumulation in the nucleus accumbens in tangle-predominant dementia.,BACKGROUND: Tangle-predominant dementia (TPD) is characterized neuropathologically by numerous neurofibrillary tangles in the limbic areas with no or occasional senile plaques throughout the brain. TPD is an under-recognized disease  while it is a common cause of dementia in those over 80ﾂyears of age. In the present study  we describe hyperphosphorylated tau (tau) accumulation in the nucleus accumbens (Acb) in patients with TPD. RESULTS: We investigated immunohistochemically the brain tissues from 7 patients with TPD  22 with Alzheimer disease (AD) and 11 non-demented aged subjects. In the Acb of all 7 TPD patients  a considerable number of tau positive neurons were found together with many neuropil threads. The tau deposits in the Acb were labeled with all the anti-tau antibodies used in the present study. They included conformational change-specific  phosphorylation-specific and phosphorylation-independent antibodies. The Acb consists of the predominant medium-sized neurons with a small number of large neurons. Both the cell types were affected by tau pathology in TPD. Tau accumulation in the majority of such neurons appeared to be pretangle-like  diffuse deposits with only occasional paired helical filament formation. Tau positive neurons were also found in the Acb in some AD and non-demented aged subjects but much fewer in the majority of cases. The immunoblot analyses of fresh frozen samples of the Acb and parahippocampal cortex from 3 TPD and 3ﾂAD patients revealed that the insoluble tau in the Acb was a mixture of the 3- and 4-repeat isoforms. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge  this is the first report on the occurrence of tau accumulation in the Acb in TPD. The Acb receives direct and massive projections from the hippocampal CA1 and subiculum where neurofibrillary tangles are known to occur more frequently in TPD than in AD. The prevalence of abnormal tau accumulation in the Acb in TPD may support the idea that abnormal tau aggregation propagates via neural circuits. In all but one TPD cases used in this study  delusion was a consistent clinical feature. Whether the Acb tau accumulation is related to the psychiatric symptoms in TPD may be an issue for further investigation.,0,Tau accumulation in the nucleus accumbens in tangle-predominant dementia.BACKGROUND: Tangle-predominant dementia (TPD) is characterized neuropathologically by numerous neurofibrillary tangles in the limbic areas with no or occasional senile plaques throughout the brain.

81,23867,18FDG PET versus high-dose 67Ga scintigraphy for restaging and treatment follow-up of lymphoma patients,To date  only one published study has directly compared 67Ga scintigraphy (low dose  planar) with planar dual-head gamma camera 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18FDG) imaging for the purpose of treatment follow-up monitoring in lymphoma patients  and no data on restaging are available. The present study reports the direct comparison of high-dose (297-370 MBq) 67Ga planar and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging and conventional 18FDG positron emission tomography (PET) for restaging and treatment follow-up of lymphoma patients versus a gold standard consisting of morphological imaging  including plain radiography and computed tomography (CT) scanning  bone marrow examination and long-term follow-up (<12 months). Sixteen patients  10 with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and six with Hodgkin's disease  were included (10 men  six women; median age  43 years; range  16-64 years). The median follow-up time was 27 months (range  12-34 months). In two patients  67Ga and 18FDG PET (370 MBq) were performed twice  resulting in 18 cross-sectional episodes. In 11 episodes  the results obtained by both imaging modalities were in agreement with regard to the presence or absence of disease when compared with the gold standard. However  the abnormalities found on 18FDG PET were always more extensive. In two episodes  67Ga imaging normalized after treatment  whereas PET showed significant regression followed by subsequent normalization. In four additional episodes  67Ga images were negative  whereas 18FDG PET visualized non-tumour-related pathology  such as lung infection  rib fracture or dense thymic tissue. In one gold standard-negative patient  the underlying cause of sternal FDG uptake remained undetermined. The data presented  although limited in number  suggest that 18FDG PET performs better than Ga imaging in monitoring lymphoma disease status. However  a correlation with clinical history and a knowledge of the characteristics of benign lesions are mandatory.

82,45492,Increased proportion of physical child abuse injuries at a level I pediatric trauma center during the Covid-19 pandemic,"Background and objectives: The Covid-19 pandemic has forced mass closures of childcare facilities and schools. While these measures are necessary to slow virus transmission, little is known regarding the secondary health consequences of social distancing. The purpose of this study is to assess the proportion of injuries secondary to physical child abuse (PCA) at a level I pediatric trauma center during the Covid-19 pandemic. Method(s): A retrospective review of patients at our center was conducted to identify injuries caused by PCA in the month following the statewide closure of childcare facilities in Maryland. The proportion of PCA patients treated during the Covid-19 era were compared to the corresponding period in the preceding two years by Fisher's exact test. Demographics, injury profiles, and outcomes were described for each period. Result(s): Eight patients with PCA injuries were treated during the Covid-19 period (13 % of total trauma patients), compared to four in 2019 (4 %, p < 0.05) and three in 2018 (3 %, p < 0.05). The median age of patients in the Covid-19 period was 11.5 months (IQR 6.8-24.5). Most patients were black (75 %) with public health insurance (75 %). All injuries were caused by blunt trauma, resulting in scalp/face contusions (63 %), skull fractures (50 %), intracranial hemorrhage (38 %), and long bone fractures (25 %). Conclusion(s): There was an increase in the proportion of traumatic injuries caused by physical child abuse at our center during the Covid-19 pandemic.

86,40965,Is there a place for FET PET in the initial evaluation of brain lesions with unknown significance?,Purpose: The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical value of the use of O-(2-[<sup>18</sup>F]fluoroethyl)-l-tyrosine (FET) positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) in patients of a neurological clinic for evaluation of brain lesions newly diagnosed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Methods: We evaluated 88 patients (44 women and 44 men) with a mean age of 50∈±∈19 years who were sent consecutively for evaluation of an intracerebral mass or lesion observed by MRI from 2006 to 2008. Hospitalization was necessary due to neurological clinical symptoms. Images were obtained by PET/CT 30 min after i.v. injection of 185 MBq FET. Coregistration with MRI was done by HERMES workstation. Results: FET uptake above the cortical level was observed in 60 patients. Neurosurgery was performed in 60 patients (51 with FET-positive imaging); 36 high-grade and 19 low-grade tumours were verified histologically. The sensitivity of FET PET for high-grade tumours (WHO III-IV) was 94% in this setting. Among the low-grade brain tumours (WHO I-II) 13 of 19 were FET positive  which indicates a sensitivity of 68%. Five of ten (50%) astrocytomas I and II could not be visualized by FET. Histological data were not provided for 28 of 88 patients  so the diagnostic approach is based upon longitudinal observation. Radiological and/or clinical control was done at a median of 7 months later. Three patients (all FET positive) died a few months after the examination because of rapid progression of the malignant brain tumour. A malignant entity could be excluded in the other 25 patients. Considering the whole cohort of 88 patients  43 patients with malignant tumour could be identified  including high-grade glioma  intracerebral lymphoma (n∈=∈1) and metastasis (n∈=∈3). The sensitivity of FET PET for detecting a malignant tumour entity was 93%. We observed two false-positive cases with postischaemic lesions. Remarkably  the two patients with cerebral gliomatosis were false-negative on FET PET imaging. The negative predictive value for a malignant entity was calculated to be 89%. Conclusion: Our results indicate a high sensitivity of FET PET for detecting high-grade glioma in patients with neurological symptoms and recently observed brain lesions by MRI. In the setting of evaluating new brain lesions of unknown significance via FET PET a negative image can encourage a wait and see strategy-of course in accordance with the clinical picture and morphological imaging. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.,0,Is there a place for FET PET in the initial evaluation of brain lesions with unknown significance?Purpose: The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical value of the use of O-(2-[<sup>18</sup>F]fluoroethyl)-l-tyrosine (FET) positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) in patients of a neurological clinic for evaluation of brain lesions newly diagnosed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

All had been treated with radiotherapy and other treatments such as radiosurgery  chemotherapy or different types of surgery  and presented clinical pictures which made it necessary to decide the differential diagnosis of relapse or radionecrosis. RESULTS: In the PET-FDG study visual and semiquantitative analysis was done by SUV (Standardized Update Value). Confirmation of the findings was obtained in 44 cases (24 TR and 20 RN). MR was doubtful or inconclusive in most cases  whilst with PET correct diagnosis was made in all cases.

METHODS: COVID-19 patients admitted to Tongji Hospital between January 18and March 27, 2020 were evaluated. Clinical features, laboratory data, complications and outcomes were compared between females and males. Risk factors for mortality in the whole population, females and males were determined respectively. RESULTS: There were 1667 (50.38%) females among the3309 patients included in this study. The mortality rate was only 5.9% in females but 12.7% in males. Compared with males, more females had no initial symptoms (11.1% vs 8.3%, p=0.008). Complications including acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute kidney injury, septic shock, cardiac injury and coagulation disorder were less common in females; critical illness was also significant less common in females (31.1% vs 39.4%, p<0.0001). Significantly fewer female patients received antibiotics treatment (p=0.001), antiviral therapy (p=0.025) glucocorticoids treatment (p<0.0001), mechanical ventilation (p<0.0001) and had Intensive Care Unit admission (p<0.0001). A lower risk of death was found in females (odds ratio 0.44, 95% confidence interval 0.34-0.58) after adjusting for age and coexisting diseases. Among females, age, malignancy, chronic kidney disease and days from onset to admission were significant associated with mortality, while chronic kidney disease was not risk factor in males. CONCLUSIONS: Significantly more mild illness and fewer deaths were found in female COVID-19 inpatients and risk factors associated with mortality varied among male and female population.

93,50732,Brain MRI markers and dropout in a longitudinal study of cognitive aging: the Three-City Dijon Study.,"OBJECTIVE: Longitudinal studies of dementia rely on the assumption that individuals who drop out are comparable to those who remain in the study  adjusting for measured covariates. Existing methods to handle dropouts account for differences based on past health and cognitive measures. We assess whether such adjustments fully account for differences in future dementia risk. METHODS: Among Three-City Study participants in Dijon  France  with 1 (n = 1 633) or 2 (n = 1 168) brain MRI scans  we tested whether white matter lesion volume (WMLV)  hippocampal volume  or brain CSF volume predicted dropout (""unable to contact"" or ""refused interview"") in repeated-measures logistic regression with up to 4 follow-ups (average 3.5 waves). Using linear regression  we also estimated differences in MRI volumes and MRI changes by subsequent dropout status and estimated plausible ranges for selective attrition bias based on these associations. Models were adjusted for demographic  health  and cognitive score covariates. RESULTS: Baseline greater WMLV predicted increased odds of dropping out (adjusted odds ratio = 1.71; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.20-2.43).

94,52705,Bevacizumab as a treatment option for radiation-induced cerebral necrosis,Radiation necrosis of normal CNS tissue represents one of the main risk factors of brain irradiation  occurring more frequently and earlier at higher total doses and higher doses per fraction.

This process is sustained by endothelial dysfunction  tissue hypoxia  and subsequent necrosis. Consequently  blocking the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) at an early stage could be an option to reduce the development of radiation necrosis by decreasing the vascular permeability. This might help to reverse the pathological mechanisms  improve the symptoms and prevent further progression.

95,66076,Toward a brain-computer interface for Alzheimer's disease patients by combining classical conditioning and brain state classification.,"Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) provide alternative methods for communicating and acting on the world  since messages or commands are conveyed from the brain to an external device without using the normal output pathways of peripheral nerves and muscles. Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients in the most advanced stages  who have lost the ability to communicate verbally  could benefit from a BCI that may allow them to convey basic thoughts (e.g.  ""yes"" and ""no"") and emotions. There is currently no report of such research  mostly because the cognitive deficits in AD patients pose serious limitations to the use of traditional BCIs  which are normally based on instrumental learning and require users to self-regulate their brain activation. Recent studies suggest that not only self-regulated brain signals  but also involuntary signals  for instance related to emotional states  may provide useful information about the user  opening up the path for so-called ""affective BCIs"". These interfaces do not necessarily require users to actively perform a cognitive task  and may therefore be used with patients who are cognitively challenged. In the present hypothesis paper  we propose a paradigm shift from instrumental learning to classical conditioning  with the aim of discriminating ""yes"" and ""no"" thoughts after associating them to positive and negative emotional stimuli respectively. This would represent a first step in the development of a BCI that could be used by AD patients  lending a new direction not only for communication  but also for rehabilitation and diagnosis.",0,"Toward a brain-computer interface for Alzheimer's disease patients by combining classical conditioning and brain state classification.Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) provide alternative methods for communicating and acting on the world  since messages or commands are conveyed from the brain to an external device without using the normal output pathways of peripheral nerves and muscles. Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients in the most advanced stages  who have lost the ability to communicate verbally  could benefit from a BCI that may allow them to convey basic thoughts (e.g.  ""yes"" and ""no"") and emotions. There is currently no report of such research  mostly because the cognitive deficits in AD patients pose serious limitations to the use of traditional BCIs  which are normally based on instrumental learning and require users to self-regulate their brain activation. Recent studies suggest that not only self-regulated brain signals  but also involuntary signals  for instance related to emotional states  may provide useful information about the user  opening up the path for so-called ""affective BCIs"". These interfaces do not necessarily require users to actively perform a cognitive task  and may therefore be used with patients who are cognitively challenged.

96,39932,Tocilizumab and liver injury in patients with COVID-19,"Current mortality rate in patients with COVID-19 disease is about 2%, whereas 5% of patients require admission to the intensive care unit. It is assumed that interleukin (IL)-6 may be involved in the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19 infections; therefore, in the absence of a specific antiviral therapy, some authors have suggested that tocilizumab - a drug used to block the signal transduction pathway of IL-6 - could have beneficial effects in the management of severe COVID-19 disease. However, mild-to-moderate elevation in transaminases and drug-induced liver injury have been observed in patients treated with tocilizumab. We present seven cases of patients with elevated liver enzymes [up to five times the upper limit of normal (ULN)] at baseline who received tocilizumab for life-threatening COVID-19 disease. All patients had no history of liver or pulmonary disease and were admitted for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, dyspnea and fever due to COVID-19 bilateral pneumonia. IL-6 was available in six patients, and was significantly increased particularly in those with severe impairment of lung function. All patients received tocilizumab (8 mg/kg/day) for two consecutive days because of lack of improvement after hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin and lopinavir/ritonavir treatment. After tocilizumab administration, clinical condition rapidly improved and liver function test normalized within 3 weeks of treatment. Tocilizumab may be effective for the treatment of severe COVID-19 disease, even in patients with elevated liver function tests. Further studies are needed to evaluate the impact of tocilizumab use on liver function tests in patients with pre-existing chronic liver disease.Copyright Â© The Author(s), 2020.",0,"Tocilizumab and liver injury in patients with COVID-19Current mortality rate in patients with COVID-19 disease is about 2%, whereas 5% of patients require admission to the intensive care unit.

98,56112,C1q-binding peptides share sequence similarity with C4 and induce complement activation.,Two peptide motifs that bind to C1q have been identified from phage displayed libraries. A first panning cycle recovered phage that displayed a [N/S]PFxL motif. A synthetic peptide with that motif blocked those phage from binding to C1q. A second panning cycle was conducted with the [N/S]PFxL motif peptide present  leading to recovery of phage displaying a different motif  SHY. The two motifs are specific for C1q and are competed by DNA and the cognate synthetic peptide but not by immunoglobulins. Phage displayed peptide sequences containing the [N/S]PFxL have significant sequence similarity to a region of complement component C4  suggesting a possible site of interaction between C4  or one of its processed forms  and C1q. The SHY motif peptide induces C4 consumption in a hemolytic assay  suggesting that it activates C1 independent of immune complexes. This peptide may activate C1 by a mechanism similar to the beta-amyloid peptides found in Alzheimer's disease.,0,C1q-binding peptides share sequence similarity with C4 and induce complement activation.Two peptide motifs that bind to C1q have been identified from phage displayed libraries.

99,49335,White matter hyperintensities and amyloid are independently associated with entorhinal cortex volume among individuals with mild cognitive impairment.,BACKGROUND: Current hypothetical models of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis emphasize the role of ﾎｲ-amyloid (Aﾎｲ)  tau deposition  and neurodegenerative changes in the mesial temporal lobe  particularly the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus. However  many individuals with clinical AD who come to autopsy also exhibit cerebrovascular disease. The relationship between AD and vascular pathology is unclear  especially whether they represent additive and independent effects on neuronal injury. We used data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) to (1) confirm whether entorhinal cortex and hippocampal volume are associated with memory among individuals with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) who are at risk for AD; and (2) determine whether regional white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volume  a radiological marker of small-vessel cerebrovascular disease  is associated with entorhinal cortex and hippocampal volume independent of putative AD biomarkers in this group. METHODS: Cognitive test scores  entorhinal cortex volume  hippocampus volume  intracranial volume  and cerebrospinal fluid-derived phosphorylated tau and Aﾎｲ1-42 protein levels were measured in 199 subjects with amnestic MCI (mean ageﾂ=ﾂ74.89 ﾂｱ 7.47). Lobar WMH volumes were derived from T1-  proton-density-  and T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging scans. We examined the association between entorhinal cortex volume and cognition. Next  we examined the association of tau and Aﾎｲ1-42 with entorhinal cortex volume and between lobar WMH and entorhinal cortex volume. Finally  tau  Aﾎｲ1-42  and regional WMH volumes were entered simultaneously to predict entorhinal cortex volume. We repeated the analyses with hippocampal volume instead of entorhinal cortex volume. The analyses were also repeated with the sample restricted to those MCI patients who transitioned to AD on subsequent ADNI follow-up visits (n = 86). RESULTS: Larger entorhinal cortex volume was associated with better memory but not with performance on a task of executive functioning. Lower levels of Aﾎｲ1-42 and higher temporal WMH volumes were associated with smaller entorhinal cortex volume. When entered simultaneously  temporal lobe WMH volume was more reliably associated with entorhinal cortex volume than was Aﾎｲ1-42. The findings were similar for hippocampus volume and when the sample was restricted to MCI patients who subsequently transitioned to AD. CONCLUSIONS: The findings confirm the role of entorhinal cortex and hippocampus volume in influencing memory decline in amnestic MCI  and emphasize that even in this nominally AD prodromal condition  WMH may be influencing regional neurodegeneration.,0,White matter hyperintensities and amyloid are independently associated with entorhinal cortex volume among individuals with mild cognitive impairment.BACKGROUND: Current hypothetical models of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis emphasize the role of ﾎｲ-amyloid (Aﾎｲ)  tau deposition  and neurodegenerative changes in the mesial temporal lobe  particularly the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus.
