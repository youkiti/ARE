0,0,Characterization of Oxygen Levels in an Uninfected and Infected Human Blood-Cerebrospinal-Fluid-Barrier Model,"The host–pathogen interaction during meningitis can be investigated with blood-cerebrospinal-fluid-barrier (BCSFB) cell culture models. They are commonly handled under atmospheric oxygen conditions (19–21% O2 ), although the physiological oxygen conditions are significantly lower in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (7–8% O2 ). We aimed to characterize oxygen levels in a Streptococcus (S.) suis-infected BCSFB model with transmigrating neutrophils. A BCSFB model with human choroid plexus epithelial cells growing on transwell-filters was used. The upper “blood”-compartment was infected and blood-derived neutrophils were added. S. suis and neutrophils transmigrated through the BCSFB into the “CSF”-compartment. Here, oxygen and pH values were determined with the non-invasive SensorDish® reader. Slight orbital shaking improved the luminescence-based measurement technique for detecting free oxygen. In the non-infected BCSFB model, an oxygen value of 7% O2 was determined. However, with S. suis and transmigrating neutrophils, the oxygen value significantly decreased to 2% O2 . The pH level decreased slightly in all groups. In conclusion, we characterized oxygen levels in the BCSFB model and demonstrated the oxygen consumption by cells and bacteria. Oxygen values in the non-infected BCSFB model are comparable to in vivo values determined in pigs in the CSF.

2,2,A type VII secretion system in Group B Streptococcus mediates cytotoxicity and virulence,"Type VII secretion systems (T7SS) have been identified in Actinobacteria and Firmicutes and have been shown to secrete effector proteins with functions in virulence, host toxicity, and/or interbacterial killing in a few genera. Bioinformatic analysis indicates that isolates of Group B Streptococcus (GBS) encode at least four distinct subtypes of T7SS machinery, three of which encode adjacent putative T7SS effectors with WXG and LXG motifs. However, the function of T7SS in GBS pathogenesis is unknown. Here we assessed the role of the most abundant GBS T7SS subtype during GBS pathogenesis. In a murine model of hematogenous meningitis, mice infected with GBS lacking a functional T7SS or lacking the secreted WXG100 effector EsxA exhibited less mortality, lower bacterial burdens in tissues, and decreased inflammation in the brain compared to mice infected with the parental GBS strain. We further showed that this T7SS induces cytotoxicity in brain endothelium and that EsxA contributes to these cytotoxicity phenotypes in a WXG motif-dependent manner. Finally, we determined that EsxA is a pore-forming protein, thus demonstrating the first role for a non-mycobacterial EsxA homolog in pore formation. This work reveals the importance of a T7SS in host–GBS interactions and has implications for T7SS effector function in other Gram-positive bacteria.",FALSE,"A type VII secretion system in Group B Streptococcus mediates cytotoxicity and virulenceType VII secretion systems (T7SS) have been identified in Actinobacteria and Firmicutes and have been shown to secrete effector proteins with functions in virulence, host toxicity, and/or interbacterial killing in a few genera.

3,3,"First comprehensive proteome analysis of lysine crotonylation in Streptococcus agalactiae, a pathogen causing meningoencephalitis in teleosts","Backgroud: Streptococcus agalactiae is a common colonizer of the rectovaginal tract and lead to infectious diseases of neonatal and non-pregnant adults, which also causes infectious disease in fish and a zoonotic risk as well. Lysine crotonylation (Kcr) is a kind of histone post-translational modifications discovered in 2011. In yeast and mammals, Kcr function as potential enhancers and promote gene expression. However, lysine crotonylation in S. agalactiae has not been studied yet. Methods: In this study, the crotonylation profiling of fish pathogen, S. agalactiae was investigated by combining affinity enrichment with LC MS/MS. The Kcr modification of several selected proteins were further validated by Western blotting. Results: In the present study, we conducted the proteome-wide profiling of Kcr in S. agalactiae and identified 241 Kcr sites from 675 screened proteins for the first time. Bioinformatics analysis showed that 164 sequences were matched to a total of six definitively conserved motifs, and many of them were significantly enriched in metabolic processes, cellular process, and single-organism processes. Moreover, four crotonylation modified proteins were predicted as virulence factors or to being part of the quorum sensing system PTMs on bacteria.

4,4,A Critical Review on the Standardization and Quality Assessment of Nonfunctional Laboratory Tests Frequently Used to Identify Inborn Errors of Immunity,"Inborn errors of immunity (IEI), which were previously termed primary immunodeficiency diseases, represent a large and growing heterogeneous group of diseases that are mostly monogenic. In addition to increased susceptibility to infections, other clinical phenotypes have recently been associated with IEI, such as autoimmune disorders, severe allergies, autoinflammatory disorders, benign lymphoproliferative diseases, and malignant manifestations. The IUIS 2019 classification comprises 430 distinct defects that, although rare individually, represent a group affecting a significant number of patients, with an overall prevalence of 1:1,200-2,000 in the general population. Early IEI diagnosis is critical for appropriate therapy and genetic counseling, however, this process is deeply dependent on accurate laboratory tests. Despite the striking importance of laboratory data for clinical immunologists, several IEI-relevant immunoassays still lack standardization, including standardized protocols, reference materials, and external quality assessment programs. Moreover, well-established reference values mostly remain to be determined, especially for early ages, when the most severe conditions manifest and diagnosis is critical for patient survival. In this article, we intend to approach the issue of standardization and quality control of the nonfunctional diagnostic tests used for IEI, focusing on those frequently utilized in clinical practice.

5,5,Prevalence of meningitis in first episode of febrile seizure in children aged between 6 to 18 months: A cross-sectional study,"Introduction: Febrile Seizures (FS) are the most common type of childhood seizures, affecting 2-5% of children older than one month and most commonly from 6 months to 5-year-old. It is a major cause of paediatric admissions worldwide. In India, American Academy of Paediatrics (AAP) 2010 guidelines are followed for performing Lumbar Puncture (LP) in first episode of FS, despite the fact that epidemiological differences exist between the two countries. This study has been done to find out whether AAP guidelines are applicable in India. Aim: To find out the prevalence and predictors of meningitis in first episode of FS in children aged 6 to 18 months. Materials and Methods: This was a cross-sectional study carried out in 200 children, aged between 6 to 18 months admitted with first episode of FS in Paediatric Ward of tertiary care hospital New Delhi, India, over a period of 18 months (May 2018 to December 2019). The LP was performed and blood, Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF), clinical parameters were analysed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 21.0. Results: The prevalence of meningitis in children aged 6 to 18 months presenting with first episode of FS was 16% (n=32). Bacterial Meningitis (BM) was seen in 3% (n=6) of cases. The independent predictors of meningitis were high Total Leucocyte Count (TLC) (>16500 cells/mm3) and positive C-reactive Protein (CRP). Blood culture was positive in 7 cases (3 cases of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 2 MRSA, 1 each Klebsiella pneumoniae and Neisseria meningitidis). Most common type of cell seen was monocytes which was alone seen in 56.2% (n=18) of the meningitis cases. Conclusion: India should have its own guidelines for performing LP in cases of first episode of FS as the prevalence of meningitis in children with first episode of FS in India is more than in the USA, and immunisation coverage for Haemophilus and Pneumococcal Vaccine (PCV) is very less as compared to USA.

We assessed the functional consequences of a novel, homozygous nonsense STK4 mutation (NM_006282.2:c.871C > T, p.Arg291*) identified in a pediatric patient by comparing his innate and adaptive cell-mediated and humoral immune responses with those of three heterozygous relatives and unrelated controls. Methods: The genetic etiology was verified by whole genome and Sanger sequencing. STK4 gene and protein expression was measured by quantitative RT-PCR and immunoblotting, respectively. Cellular abnormalities were assessed by high-throughput RT-RCR, RNA-Seq, ELISA, and flow cytometry. Antibody responses were assessed by ELISA and phage immunoprecipitation-sequencing. Results: The patient exhibited partial loss of STK4 expression and complete loss of STK4 function combined with recurrent viral and bacterial infections, notably persistent Epstein–Barr virus viremia and pulmonary tuberculosis. Cellular and molecular analyses revealed abnormal fractions of T cell subsets, plasmacytoid dendritic cells, and NK cells. The transcriptional responses of the patient’s whole blood and PBMC samples indicated dysregulated interferon signaling, impaired T cell immunity, and increased T cell apoptosis as well as impaired regulation of cytokine-induced adhesion and leukocyte chemotaxis genes. Nonetheless, the patient had detectable vaccine-specific antibodies and IgG responses to various pathogens, consistent with a normal CD19 + B cell fraction, albeit with a distinctive antibody repertoire, largely driven by herpes virus antigens.

7,7,Case Report: Streptococcus Suis Meningitis Diagnosed in a HIV-Infected Patient With Cryptococcal Meningitis Using Next-Generation Sequencing,"Background: Streptococcus suis has been recognized as a zoonotic pathogen that may cause infections in humans. Although rarely described, it is not surprising that both cryptococcal and streptococcus suis meningitis infections can co-exist in a HIV-infected patient with a low CD4 count. However, a fast and accurate diagnose of meningitis of multipathogenic infections is challenging. In this report, we describe such a case of a HIV-infected patient with meningitis of multipathogenic infections. Case Presentation: The patient was a 34-year-old Chinese male who was diagnosed with cryptococcal meningitis and HIV at the same time about 1 year ago. During the same time period, he had received (with good compliance) fluconazole and tenofovir-lamivudine- dolutegravir based antiretroviral therapy (ART). However, symptom of progressively worsening occipital headache appeared after he was exposed to a truck which was used for transporting pigs. Initial workup indicated an increase of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) opening pressure (OP) and an increase in the number of lymphocytes and proteins in CSF. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan revealed that partial cerebellar surface enhancement. The cryptococcus capsular antigen test of CSF was positive. The results of the India Ink microscopy for cryptococcus, nucleic acid of CMV and EBV and mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) tests of CSF were negative. The results of the bacteria and fungi smear and culture of CSF were also negative. Eventually, streptococcus suis was detected using next-generation sequencing (NGS) in CSF. The diagnosis of Streptococcus suis meningitis was made based on the patient's contact history with carrier pigs and the clinical findings addressed above. The treatment of 2 weeks of intravenous ceftriaxone and 1 week of oral moxifloxacin resulted in improvement of the condition of CSF. The anti-fungal treatment using fluconazole continued until the CFS OP went down to a normal level and the cryptococcus capsular antigen test of CSF was negative 6 months later. Conclusion: This case highlights that NGS might be beneficial to HIV-infected patients who have meningitis with negative CSF culture results.

Its capsular polysaccharide determines the serotype and influences disease severity but the mechanism is largely unknown.

Based on multivariable Bayesian regression, using serotype 10A as a reference and after adjusting for HIV and age, we found IL-6 concentrations significantly lower in patients infected with serotypes 6D (undetectable) and 23A (1601 pg/ml), IL-8 concentrations significantly higher in those infected with 22A (40,459 pg/ml), 7F (32,400 pg/ml) and 15B/C (6845 pg/ml), and TNFα concentration significantly higher in those infected with serotype 18A (33,097 pg/ml).

12,12,Differences in Pneumococcal and Haemophilus influenzae Natural Antibody Development in Papua New Guinean Children in the First Year of Life,"Background: Development of vaccines to prevent disease and death from Streptococcus pneumoniae, and nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi), the main pathogens that cause otitis media, pneumonia, meningitis and sepsis, are a global priority. Children living in low and lower-middle income settings are at the highest risk of contracting and dying from these diseases. Improved vaccines with broader coverage are required. Data on the natural development of antibodies to putative vaccine antigens, especially in high-risk settings, can inform the rational selection of the best antigens for vaccine development. Methods: Serum IgG titres to four pneumococcal proteins (PspA1, PspA2, CbpA, and Ply) and five NTHi antigens (P4, P6, OMP26, rsPilA and ChimV4) were measured in sera collected from 101 Papua New Guinean children at 1, 4, 9, 10, 23 and 24 months of age using multiplexed bead-based immunoassays. Carriage density of S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae were assessed by quantitative PCR on genomic DNA extracted from nasopharyngeal swabs using species-specific primers and probes. All data were log-transformed for analysis using Student’s unpaired t-tests with geometric mean titre (GMT) or density (GMD) calculated with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results: Serum -pneumococcal protein-specific IgG titres followed a “U” shaped pattern, with a decrease in presumably maternally-derived IgG titres between 1 and 4 months of age and returning to similar levels as those measured at 1 month of age by 24 months of age. In contrast, NTHi protein-specific IgG titres steadily increased with age. There was no correlation between antibody titres and carriage density for either pathogen. Conclusion: This longitudinal study indicates that the waning of maternally- derived antibodies that is usually observed in infants, after infants does not occur for NTHi antigens in Papua New Guinean infants. Whether NTHi antigen IgG can be transferred maternally remains to be determined.

The aim of this study was to find out whether NanA and PLY could act on human HDL particles, and alter HDL composition, structure and function. Methods: Microscale thermophoresis was used to measure removal of sialic acids by NanA from HDL. HDL particles treated with PLY and NanA were analyzed for the presence of PLY and malondialdehyde adducts (MDA) by ELISA, protein and lipid modifications by mass spectrometry and functionality by cholesterol efflux assay. Susceptibility of modified HDL particles to complement attack was analyzed by measuring the soluble terminal complement complex, sC5b-9, from hirudin plasma. Results: HDL particles that were incubated in the presence of PLY and NanA exhibited significant changes in their sialic acid, lipid and protein composition and displayed reduced functionality evidenced as a reduced potential to egress cholesterol from activated cholesterol-loaded macrophages. Moreover, PLY and NanA treated HDL particles had elevated levels of MDA and showed significantly increased complement activating capacity in hirudin plasma.

17,17,The Effects of Cannabinoids on Pro-and Anti-Inflammatory Cytokines: A Systematic Review of in Vivo Studies,"Introduction: Some cannabinoids have been identified as anti-inflammatory agents; however, their potential therapeutic or prophylactic applications remain controversial. The aim of this systematic review was to provide a timely and comprehensive insight into cannabinoid-mediated pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine responses in preclinical in vivo studies. Methods and Materials: A systematic search was conducted using PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, and Scopus. Eligible studies where cannabinoids had been evaluated for their effect on inflammation in animal models were included in the analysis. Data were extracted from 26 of 4247 eligible full text articles, and risk of bias was assessed using the SYstematic Review Center for Laboratory animal Experimentation (SYRCLE) tool. Studies examined cannabidiol (CBD; n=20); cannabigerol (CBG; n=1); delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC; n=2); THC and CBD separately (n=1); and THC and CBD in combination (n=2). Results: Tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and interferon gamma were the most commonly studied pro-inflammatory cytokines and their levels were consistently reduced after treatment with CBD, CBG, or CBD+THC, but not with THC alone. The association between cannabinoid-induced anti-inflammatory response and disease severity was examined. In 22 studies where CBD, CBG, or CBD in combination with THC were administered, a reduction in the levels of at least one inflammatory cytokine was observed, and in 24 studies, some improvements in disease or disability were apparent. THC alone did not reduce pro-inflammatory cytokine levels (n=3), but resulted in improvements in neuropathic pain in one study. Conclusions: This review shows that CBD, CBG, and CBD+THC combination exert a predominantly anti-inflammatory effect in vivo, whereas THC alone does not reduce pro-inflammatory or increase anti-inflammatory cytokines.

The aim of this systematic review was to provide a timely and comprehensive insight into cannabinoid-mediated pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine responses in preclinical in vivo studies. Methods and Materials: A systematic search was conducted using PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, and Scopus. Eligible studies where cannabinoids had been evaluated for their effect on inflammation in animal models were included in the analysis. Data were extracted from 26 of 4247 eligible full text articles, and risk of bias was assessed using the SYstematic Review Center for Laboratory animal Experimentation (SYRCLE) tool. Studies examined cannabidiol (CBD; n=20); cannabigerol (CBG; n=1); delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC; n=2); THC and CBD separately (n=1); and THC and CBD in combination (n=2). Results: Tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and interferon gamma were the most commonly studied pro-inflammatory cytokines and their levels were consistently reduced after treatment with CBD, CBG, or CBD+THC, but not with THC alone.

Identifying a pathogen is important, both in terms of guiding therapeutic management and in characterizing prognosis. Usual care testing by culture and polymerase chain reaction is often unable to identify a pathogen. We examined the systematic application of metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) for detecting organisms and transcriptomic analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in children with central nervous system (CNS) infections.

19,19,"Immunogenicity and safety of a novel ten-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in healthy infants in The Gambia: a phase 3, randomised, double-blind, non-inferiority trial","Background: An affordable pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) is needed to ensure sustainable access in low-income and middle-income countries. This trial examined the immunogenicity and safety of a novel ten-valent PCV (SIIPL-PCV) containing serotypes 1, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 19A, 19F, and 23F compared with the pneumococcal polysaccharide protein D-conjugate vaccine (PHiD-CV; Synflorix; GlaxoSmithKline; Brentford, UK). Methods: In this single-centre, randomised, double-blind, phase 3, non-inferiority trial in The Gambia, healthy, PCV-naive infants aged 6–8 weeks were enrolled and assigned using permuted block randomisation to receive one of three lots of SIIPL-PCV or to PHiD-CV in a ratio of 2:2:2:3. Parents and all staff assessing study outcomes were masked to group assignment. Vaccines (0·5 mL SIIPL-PCV or 0·5 mL PHiD-CV) were administered at ages 6, 10, and 14 weeks by intramuscular injection. Primary immunogenicity outcomes, measured at age 18 weeks, were serotype-specific IgG geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) and seroresponse rates (IgG ≥ 0·35 μg/mL). Lot-to-lot equivalence (objective 1) was shown if the upper and lower bounds of the two-sided 95% CI around the GMC ratio for each pairwise lot-to-lot comparison was between the 0·5 and 2·0 equivalence margins for all ten serotypes. The immunogenicity of SIIPL-PCV was defined as being non-inferior to that of PHiD-CV (objective 2) if, for at least seven of the ten serotypes in SIIPL-PCV, the lower bound of the 97·5% CI for the GMC ratio was greater than 0·5, or the lower bound of the 97·5% CI for differences in seroresponse rate was greater than −10%. The GMC and seroresponse rates to serotypes 6A and 19A, which are not in PHiD-CV, were compared with those of the serotype in PHiD-CV that had the lowest seroresponse rate. Non-inferiority of the immune responses to antigens in the co-administered Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) vaccines (objective 3) was declared if the lower bound of the 95% CI for the difference between SIIPL-PCV and PHiD-CV in seroresponse rates, or GMC ratios for pertussis antigens, was greater than −10% (or 0·5 for pertussis antigens) for all vaccine antigens. Safety data were assessed according to treatment received at the first visit in infants who received at least one dose of study vaccine and for whom at least some post-vaccination safety data were available. The primary immunogenicity analysis was in the per-protocol immunogenicity population, which included infants who received all study vaccines and had immunogenicity measurements after vaccination and no major protocol deviations. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03197376). Findings: Between June 21, 2017, and Jan 29, 2018, 2250 infants were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive SIIPL-PCV (n=1503; 502 to lot 1, 501 to lot 2, and 500 to lot 3) or PHiD-CV (n=747). 1458 (97·0%) infants assigned to SIIPL-PCV and 724 (96·9%) assigned to PHiD-CV were included in the per-protocol primary immunogenicity analysis. Lot-to-lot equivalence was shown, with the lowest lower bound of the 95% CI for the GMC ratio being 0·52 (for serotype 6B in lot 2 vs lot 3) and the highest upper bound being 1·69 (for serotype 6B in lot 1 vs lot 2). SIIPL-PCV was non-inferior to PHiD-CV in terms of immunogenicity: the lower bound of the 97·5% CI for the GMC ratio was greater than 0·5 (the lowest being 0·67 for serotype 19F) and the lower bound of the 97·5% CI for the difference in seroresponse rate was greater than −10% (the lowest being −2·2% for serotype 6B) for all ten serotypes in SIIPL-PCV. The lowest seroresponse rate after PHiD-CV was to serotype 6B (76·7% [95% CI 73·4–79·7]). This serotype was therefore used for the comparisons with serotype 6A and 19A in SIIPL-PCV. Non-inferiority of immune responses to the EPI vaccines after co-administration with SIIPL-PCV compared with after co-administration with PHiD-CV was shown for all vaccine antigens included in the primary series. The lowest lower bound of the 95% CI for the difference in seroresponse rates was −7·1% for rotavirus antibody and for the GMC ratio for pertussis antigens was 0·62 for anti-pertussis toxoid. 1131 (75·2%) of 1503 infants in the SIIPL-PCV group and 572 (76·6%) of 747 in the PHiD-CV group had at least one unsolicited adverse event. 36 (2·4%) participants in the SIIPL-PCV group and 18 (2·4%) in the PHiD-CV group had a serious adverse event; none were considered related to vaccination. In infants who were selected to have solicited adverse events recorded, injection-site induration after primary vaccinations occurred in 27 (4·9%) of 751 infants who received SIIPL-PCV versus 34 (9·4%) of 364 who received PHiD-CV (p=0·0032). There were no other notable differences in the safety profiles of the two vaccines. One infant in the SIIPL-PCV group and two in the PHiD-CV group died during the study. The deaths were not considered to be related to study vaccination or study participation.

We evaluated the utility of the BioFire FilmArray Meningitis/Encephalitis multiplex PCR panel (FilmArray ME) in HIV-infected adults and HIV-infected and uninfected children presenting with suspected meningitis in Uganda. Methods: We tested cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) using a stepwise diagnostic algorithm including FilmArray ME. We determined the diagnostic performance of FilmArray ME for cryptococcal meningitis, using cryptococcal antigen (CrAg) and CSF culture as reference standards, and assessed other central nervous system (CNS) pathogens identified by the panel. We also assessed the advantages and disadvantages of using this panel in our setting. Results: We evaluated 258 adult and 42 pediatric CSF specimens using FilmArray ME. For Cryptococcus, sensitivity was 82%, specificity was 98%, PPV was 98%, and NPV was 79% in specimens using CSF CrAg as reference standard. Overall sensitivity was decreased at low fungal burdens: 29% for 0-99 Cryptococcus CFU/mL compared to 94% for ≥100 CFU/mL in diagnostic specimens. Other pathogens detected included E. coli, H. influenzae, S. pneumoniae, CMV, enterovirus, HSV, HHV-6, and VZV. Two specimens tested positive for S. pneumoniae and one for Cryptococcus in the pediatric population. Advantages of the panel included ease of set up and use, minimal CSF processing, and multiple pathogen targets requiring a small sample volume.

22,22,Interrogating the role (s) of macrophage function at the maternal-fetal inter face in a scendingv aginal Group B Streptococcus infection,"Problem: Group B Streptococcus (Streptococcus agalactiae, GBS) is a leading bacterial cause of stillbirth, early onset neonatal sepsis (EOS), and meningitis, which commonly result from the in utero inoculation of the fetus before delivery. Although there are a number of protective mechanisms against fetal infection, which include the influence of the normal vaginal microbiome and secretion of antimicrobial peptides of the cervical mucous plug and amniotic fluid, the fetal membranes (choriodecidua and amnion) represent a critical 'final barrier' between the lower genital tract and the incubating fetus. Macrophages, with the potential for pathogen recognition and effector function, are a key component of the fetal membrane innate immune system. Interestingly, the fetal membranes include both macrophages derived from the mother (decidual macrophages, DMs) and the fetus (Hofbauer cells, HCs), though the unique roles for these genetically distinct cells are not well defined. We hypothesize that maternal and fetal macrophages contribute differentially to host protection and the inflammatory responses to invasive pathogens such as GBS. Method of Study: Using a mouse model of ascending vaginal GBS infection or chorioamnionitis (CAM), we have phenotypically characterized both DMs and HCs at various gestational ages along the M1-M2 spectrum using flow cytometry. Additionally we utilized ELISA analysis of cytokines from reproductive tissues to identify either an inflammatory or anti-inflammatory environment to coincide with macrophage phenotype. Results: Our preliminary data suggest that both DMs and HCs have the potential to be skewed towards an M1 phenotype in the setting of GBS CAM. Flow cytometry analysis of DMs and HCs demonstrate a higher percentage of CD45+F4/80+ macrophages with an inflammatory M1 phenotype (expression of cell surface markers CD38, CD80) versus an anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype (CD206, CD209). We also show lower bacterial burden along the reproductive tract as gestational age progresses closer to term. Conclusions: Our data suggest that in the setting of ascending GBS infection, DMs and HCs are shifted towards an M1 inflammatory phenotype. This may represent a shift in the balance between immune tolerance and inflammation at the maternal-fetal interface that causes worse fetal outcomes earlier in gestational age as compared to closer to term. Future studies will extend our model of GBS CAM by using a mouse strain in which either DMs or HCs can be differentially depleted to assess the individual roles of both types of macrophages in pathogen-protection and in the balance of immune tolerance versus inflammation in the setting of infection.",FALSE,"Interrogating the role (s) of macrophage function at the maternal-fetal inter face in a scendingv aginal Group B Streptococcus infectionProblem: Group B Streptococcus (Streptococcus agalactiae, GBS) is a leading bacterial cause of stillbirth, early onset neonatal sepsis (EOS), and meningitis, which commonly result from the in utero inoculation of the fetus before delivery.

We also show lower bacterial burden along the reproductive tract as gestational age progresses closer to term. Conclusions: Our data suggest that in the setting of ascending GBS infection, DMs and HCs are shifted towards an M1 inflammatory phenotype. This may represent a shift in the balance between immune tolerance and inflammation at the maternal-fetal interface that causes worse fetal outcomes earlier in gestational age as compared to closer to term. Future studies will extend our model of GBS CAM by using a mouse strain in which either DMs or HCs can be differentially depleted to assess the individual roles of both types of macrophages in pathogen-protection and in the balance of immune tolerance versus inflammation in the setting of infection.",FALSE,"{'judgement': 'False', 'index': 22}",0,"{'judgement': 'False', 'index': 22}",0,"{'judgement': 'False', 'index': 22}",0,"{'judgement': 'False', 'index': 22}",0,"{'judgement': 'False', 'index': 22}",0,"{'judgement': 'False', 'index': 22}",0,"{'judgement': 'False', 'index': 22}",0,"{'judgement': 'False', 'index': 22}",0,"{'judgement': 'False', 'index': 22}",0,"{'judgement': 'False', 'index': 22}",0

Here, we report the first data on the immunogenicity of this reduced-dose schedule to help to interpret this effectiveness estimate. Methods: In this multicentre, parallel-group, open-label, randomised clinical trial, infants aged up to 13 weeks due to receive their primary immunisations were recruited via child health database mailouts in Oxfordshire and via general practice surgeries in Gloucestershire and Hertfordshire. Infants were randomly assigned (1:1) with permuted block randomisation to receive a 2 + 1 (2, 4, and 12 months; group 1) or 1 + 1 (3 and 12 months; group 2) schedule of the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13). All infants also received 4CMenB at 2, 4, and 12 months of age, and had blood samples taken at 5 and 13 months. Participants and clinical trial staff were not masked to treatment allocation. Proportions of participants with human complement serum bactericidal antibody (hSBA) titres of at least 4 were determined for group B meningococcus (MenB) reference strains 5/99 (Neisserial Adhesin A [NadA]), NZ98/254 (porin A), and 44/76-SL (factor H binding protein [fHbp]). Geometric mean titres (GMTs) with 95% CIs were also calculated, and concomitant vaccine responses (group C meningococcus [MenC], Haemophilus influenzae b [Hib], tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis) were compared between groups. The primary outcome was PCV13 immunogenicity, with 4CMenB immunogenicity and reactogenicity as secondary outcomes. All individuals by randomised group with a laboratory result were included in the analysis. The study is registered on the EudraCT clinical trials database, 2015-000817-32, and ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02482636, and is complete. Findings: Between Sept 22, 2015, and Nov 1, 2017, of 376 infants screened, 213 were enrolled (106 in group 1 and 107 in group 2). 204 samples post-primary immunisation and 180 post-boost were available for analysis. The proportion of participants with hSBA of at least 4 was similar in the two study groups. For strain 5/99, all participants developed hSBA titres above 4 in both groups and at both timepoints. For strain 44/76-SL, these proportions were 95·3% (95% CI 88·5–98·7) or above post-priming (82 of 86 participants in group 1), and 92·4% (84·2–97·2) or above post-boost (73 of 79 participants in group 1). For strain NZ98/254, these proportions were 86·5% (78·0–92·6) or above post-priming (83 of 96 participants in group 2) and 88·6% (79·5–94·7) or above post-boost (70 of 79 participants in group 1). The MenC rabbit complement serum bactericidal antibody (rSBA) titre in group 1 was significantly higher than in group 2 (888·3 vs 540·4; p=0·025). There was no significant difference in geometric mean concentrations between groups 1 and 2 for diphtheria, tetanus, Hib, and pertussis post-boost. A very small number of children did not have a protective response against 44/76-SL and NZ98/254. Local and systemic reactions were similar between the two groups, apart from the 3 month timepoint when one group received an extra dose of PCV13 and recorded more systemic reactions. Interpretation: These data support the recent change to the licensed European schedule for 4CMenB to add an infant 2 + 1 schedule, as used in the routine UK vaccine programme with an effectiveness of 59·1%. When compared with historical data, our data do not suggest that effectiveness would be higher with a 3 + 1 schedule, however a suboptimal boost response for bactericidal antibodies against vaccine antigen fHbp suggests a need for ongoing surveillance for vaccine breakthroughs due to fHbp-matched strains. Changing from a 2 + 1 to a 1 + 1 schedule for PCV13 for the UK is unlikely to affect protection against diphtheria, tetanus, and Hib, however an unexpected reduction in bactericidal antibodies against MenC seen with the new schedule suggests that ongoing surveillance for re-emergent MenC disease is important.

Coagulation plays a pivotal role in the normal response to pathogens (immunothrombosis), thus the evolution toward sepsis-induced coagulopathy could be individuate through coagulation/fibrinolysis-related biomarkers. We focused on the role of D-dimer assessed within 24 h after admission in predicting clinical outcomes in a cohort of 270 patients hospitalized in a 79 months period for meningitis and/or bloodstream infections due to Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 162) or Neisseria meningitidis (n = 108). Comparisons were performed with unpaired t-test, Mann-Whitney-test or chi-squared-test with continuity correction, as appropriate, and multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed with Bayesian model averaging. In-hospital mortality was 14.8% for the overall population, significantly higher in S. pneumoniae than in N. meningitidis patients: 19.1 vs. 8.3%, respectively (p = 0.014). At univariable logistic regression analysis the following variables were significantly associated with in-hospital mortality: pneumococcal etiology, female sex, age, ICU admission, SOFA score, septic shock, MODS, and D-dimer levels. At multivariable analysis D-dimer showed an effect only in N. meningitidis subgroup: as 500 ng/mL of D-dimer increased, the probability of unfavorable outcome increased on average by 4%. Median D-dimer was significantly higher in N. meningitidis than in S. pneumoniae patients (1,314 vs. 1,055 ng/mL, p = 0.009). For N. meningitidis in-hospital mortality was 0% for D-dimer <500 ng/mL, very low (3.5%) for D-dimer <7,000 ng/mL, and increased to 26.1% for D-dimer >7,000 ng/mL.

Many different viral and bacterial pathogens can cause meningitis, with differences in mortality rates, risk of developing neurological sequelae, and treatment options. Here, we constructed a compendium of digital cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteome maps to define pathogen-specific host response patterns in meningitis. The results revealed a drastic and pathogen-type specific influx of tissue-, cell-, and plasma proteins in the CSF, where, in particular, a large increase of neutrophil-derived proteins in the CSF correlated with acute bacterial meningitis. Additionally, both acute bacterial and viral meningitis result in marked reduction of brain-enriched proteins. Generation of a multiprotein LASSO regression model resulted in an 18-protein panel of cell-and tissue-associated proteins capable of classifying acute bacterial meningitis and viral meningitis.

Many different viral and bacterial pathogens can cause meningitis, with differences in mortality rates, risk of developing neurological sequelae, and treatment options. Here, we constructed a compendium of digital cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteome maps to define pathogen-specific host response patterns in meningitis. The results revealed a drastic and pathogen-type specific influx of tissue-, cell-, and plasma proteins in the CSF, where, in particular, a large increase of neutrophil-derived proteins in the CSF correlated with acute bacterial meningitis. Additionally, both acute bacterial and viral meningitis result in marked reduction of brain-enriched proteins. Generation of a multiprotein LASSO regression model resulted in an 18-protein panel of cell-and tissue-associated proteins capable of classifying acute bacterial meningitis and viral meningitis.

Cytokines are important molecules in regulating of host inflammatory and anti-inflammatory responses. So far, the cytokine profile of bacterial meningitis caused by single pathogen has been rarely reported. The aim of this study was to explore serum cytokine profile in pediatric patients with pneumococcal meningitis (PM) and its clinical relevance which could be considered as a valuable tool for differential diagnosis of PM. Methods: During 2015–2018, 95 children with laboratory-confirmed PM were included. Of them, 63 had serum samples at admission. Ten cytokines including TNF-α, IL-12p40, IL-17A, IL-1β, IFN-γ, GM-CSF, IL-10, CXCL-1, IL-8 and IL-13 were measured by multiplex immunoassay in sera of 63 PM patients and 55 age-matched healthy controls (HCs). Level of serum cytokines was compared with different clinical features of patients. Results: Significantly higher level of IL-10 was observed in patients than HCs (median, 2.19 vs. 1.92 pg/mL, p = 0.017). Significantly lower levels of serum IL-12p40, IL-17A and IL-1β were observed in patients than HCs (median, 0.68 vs. 10.12 pg/mL, p < 0.0001; 1.14 vs. 1.14 pg/mL, p = 0.004; 1.00 vs. 5.09 pg/mL, p < 0.0001, respectively).

In this study, we identified the host transmembrane receptors α5β1 and αvβ3 integrins as the ligands of Srr2, a major CC17-GBS-specific adhesin. Two motifs located in the binding region of Srr2 were responsible for the interaction between CC17-GBS and these integrins. We demonstrated in a blood-brain-barrier cellular model that both integrins contributed to the adhesion and internalization of CC17-GBS. Strikingly, both integrins were overexpressed during the postnatal period in the brain vessels of the blood-brain barrier and blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier and contributed to juvenile susceptibility to CC17 meningitis. Finally, blocking these integrins decreased the ability of CC17-GBS to cross into the CNS of juvenile mice in an in vivo model of meningitis.

We conducted a diagnostic validation study to investigate the performance of clinical features (fever, convulsions, irritability, bulging fontanel and temperature =39°C) and WHO-recommended signs (drowsiness, lethargy, unconsciousness, convulsions, bulging fontanel, irritability or a high-pitched cry) in discriminating meningitis in young infants. Design Retrospective cohort study. Setting Kilifi County Hospital. Patients Infants aged <60 days hospitalised between 2012 and 2016. Main outcome measure Definite meningitis defined as positive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) culture, microscopy or antigen test, or leucocytes =0.05 x 10a 9/L. Results Of 4809 infants aged <60 days included, 81 (1.7%) had definite meningitis.

44,44,Pre-biologic screening in a high risk area: Are we adhering to guidelines?,"Introduction Newham University Hospital, Bart's NHS Trust, serves the London Borough of Newham which had the highest incidence of tuberculosis in the UK at 78.0 per 100,000 in 2014. Newham also has the highest average annual rate of new reported acute hepatitis B infection in the UK. There have been clear guidelines on pre-biologic screening for opportunistic infections since 2014. Our aim is to assess whether patients who are on biologic therapy have been appropriately screened prior to initiation of biologic therapy. Methods A retrospective review of all IBD patients on the biologic database was performed in November 2019. Patients who were initiated on biologics prior to the publication of guidelines in June 2014 were excluded. Results The total number of patients was 63. 31 patients (49.2%) had latent tuberculosis testing with Interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) testing and 2 were positive. Screening with Chest XR (CXR) was better with 58.9% concordance. 36 patients had normal CXRs and 1 had an appearance of a granuloma. In comparison, viral screening had higher completion rates. Hepatitis B Surface Antigen (HbsAg) was sent in 53 patients (84%) and all were negative. Hepatitis B Core Antibody (HbcAb) was sent in 23 patients (36.5%) and 1 was positive. 1 patient was HbcAb positive but HbsAg negative. In terms of Hepatitis C, 51 patients (80.9%) had Hepatitis C IgG sent and all were negative. All 50 patients (79.3%) who were tested for Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV I+II antibody) were negative. Ebstein Bar Virus IgG was sent in 20 patients (31.7%), out of which, 15 were negative. Varicella-Zoster Virus IgG was sent in 39 patients (61.9%) and 2 were positive. An infection history was not taken, for either bacterial, fungal or viral infections and Bacille Calmette-Guerin vaccination status was not documented. No documentation was present regarding measles status. Routine vaccination status was not confirmed for diphtheria, poliomyelitis, pertussis, tetanus or Human Papilloma Virus.

Newham also has the highest average annual rate of new reported acute hepatitis B infection in the UK. There have been clear guidelines on pre-biologic screening for opportunistic infections since 2014. Our aim is to assess whether patients who are on biologic therapy have been appropriately screened prior to initiation of biologic therapy. Methods A retrospective review of all IBD patients on the biologic database was performed in November 2019. Patients who were initiated on biologics prior to the publication of guidelines in June 2014 were excluded. Results The total number of patients was 63. 31 patients (49.2%) had latent tuberculosis testing with Interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) testing and 2 were positive. Screening with Chest XR (CXR) was better with 58.9% concordance. 36 patients had normal CXRs and 1 had an appearance of a granuloma. In comparison, viral screening had higher completion rates. Hepatitis B Surface Antigen (HbsAg) was sent in 53 patients (84%) and all were negative. Hepatitis B Core Antibody (HbcAb) was sent in 23 patients (36.5%) and 1 was positive. 1 patient was HbcAb positive but HbsAg negative. In terms of Hepatitis C, 51 patients (80.9%) had Hepatitis C IgG sent and all were negative. All 50 patients (79.3%) who were tested for Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV I+II antibody) were negative. Ebstein Bar Virus IgG was sent in 20 patients (31.7%), out of which, 15 were negative. Varicella-Zoster Virus IgG was sent in 39 patients (61.9%) and 2 were positive. An infection history was not taken, for either bacterial, fungal or viral infections and Bacille Calmette-Guerin vaccination status was not documented. No documentation was present regarding measles status. Routine vaccination status was not confirmed for diphtheria, poliomyelitis, pertussis, tetanus or Human Papilloma Virus. Prior to initiation of immunomodulation, vaccination was not considered for pneumococcal or influenza infections.

Underlying causes of high mortality are poorly understood. We examined the host and pathogen proteome in the CSF of adults with proven pneumococcal meningitis (PM), testing if there was an association between differentially expressed proteins and outcome. Materials/Methods: CSF proteomes were analyzed by quantitative Mass-Spectrometry. Spectra were identified using the Swissprot human and TIGR4 pneumococcal protein libraries. Proteins were quantitated and analyzed against mortality. Unique proteins in PM were identified against published normal CSF proteome. Random-Forest models were used to test for protein signatures discriminating outcome. Proteins of interest were tested for their effects on growth and neutrophil opsonophagocytic killing of S. pneumoniae. Results: CSF proteomes were available for 57 Adults with PM (median age 32 years, 60% male, 70% HIV-1 co-infected, mortality 63%). Three hundred sixty individual human and 23 pneumococcal proteins were identified. Of the human protein hits, 30% were not expressed in normal CSF, and these were strongly associated with inflammation and primarily related to neutrophil activity. No human protein signature predicted outcome. However, expression of the essential S. pneumoniae protein Elongation Factor Tu (EF-Tu) was significantly increased in CSF of non-survivors [False Discovery Rate (q) <0.001]. Expression of EF-Tu was negatively co-correlated against expression of Neutrophil defensin (r 0.4 p p < 0.002), but not against complement proteins C3 or Factor H.

53,53,Evaluation of live attenuated Streptococcus pneumoniae vaccine strains on the epithelial response to colonisation using a human challenge model,"Background: Streptococcus pneumoniae frequently colonises the human nasopharynx but causes over 500,000 deaths each year from Pneumonia, Sepsis and Meningitis. Nasopharyngeal carriage is required for transmission and is a pre-requisite for disease. The conjugate polysaccharide vaccines have proven effective in decreasing disease. However, replacement of vaccine serotypes with non-vaccine types in carriage threatens the future of the vaccines’ efficiency. Using an Experimental Human Pneumococcal Challenge model (EHPC) and epithelial cell culture models, we have previously shown that pneumococcal colonisation involves both direct epithelial association and micro-invasion, inducing innate immunity and clearance without overt disease. Repeated challenge in the EHPC with the same strain decreases subsequent carriage efficiency and diminishes transmission potential and/or progression to disease, suggesting active mucosal immunity in the nasopharynx. Methods and materials: We have generated live attenuated strains of 6B S. pneumoniae (AS1 and AS2) that have double virulence deletions and cannot revert to cause disease. Here, we have explored the hypothesis that despite their attenuation in a mouse model of disease, these attenuated strains retain their ability to invade the epithelium and induce epithelial-derived innate immunity in humans. Colonisation were measured by confocal microscopy and microbiology density by CFU counts. Epithelial activation was measured by flow cytometry, ELISA and RNAseq. Results: We found that both mutants colonised the human nasopharynx and formed epithelial associations with micro-invasion in the EHPC model. In vitro, both mutants adhered, invaded and transmigrated across the epithelium 4-fold less than wild type. However, both mutants still resulted in secretion of IL-8, IL-6 and ICAM-1 secretion and barrier integrity was maintained. PCA analyses revealed that epithelial transcriptomic responses between wild type and the mutants generally overlapped, indicating overall similar stimulation of signaling pathways following exposure. Conclusion: The results reveal that attenuation of these pneumococcal strains has not led to loss of their ability to elicit a mucosal immune/inflammatory response. This approach provides an exciting new pipeline for the development and testing of novel vaccines. The application of these attenuated strains in the EHPC also has the potential to provide important new knowledge on the mechanisms behind bacterial clearance, transmission and disease progression during colonisation.",FALSE,"Evaluation of live attenuated Streptococcus pneumoniae vaccine strains on the epithelial response to colonisation using a human challenge modelBackground: Streptococcus pneumoniae frequently colonises the human nasopharynx but causes over 500,000 deaths each year from Pneumonia, Sepsis and Meningitis.

PCA analyses revealed that epithelial transcriptomic responses between wild type and the mutants generally overlapped, indicating overall similar stimulation of signaling pathways following exposure. Conclusion: The results reveal that attenuation of these pneumococcal strains has not led to loss of their ability to elicit a mucosal immune/inflammatory response. This approach provides an exciting new pipeline for the development and testing of novel vaccines. The application of these attenuated strains in the EHPC also has the potential to provide important new knowledge on the mechanisms behind bacterial clearance, transmission and disease progression during colonisation.",FALSE,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 53}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 53}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 53}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 53}",1,"{'judgement': 'False', 'index': 53}",0,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 53}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 53}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 53}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 53}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 53}",1

Common etiological agents include Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) and Neisseria meningitidis. Vaccination against Hib is already covered in the national immunization program (NIP) in India and a phased introduction of Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine (PCV-13) was started in 2017. Towards understanding the trends in common etiologies of bacterial pneumonia/IBDs and serotype distribution of S. Pneumoniae in pre and post-vaccination scenario, a hospital based surveillance network was established in 2016. Preliminary findings from the surveillance network are herein reported. Methods & Materials: Children aged 1–59 months admitted to six pediatric hospitals with suspected pneumonia, meningitis and sepsis were enrolled between 2016 and 2018. At the hospital site, blood, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and other normally sterile body fluids samples were collected and processed following conventional microbiological procedures. CSF was additionally screened by latex-agglutination (Wellcogen). PCR, serotyping (Quellung reaction) and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of pneumococcal isolates at the network's reference laboratory. Results: A total of 2008 blood, 730 CSF and 81 other samples were collected from 2297 enrolled children. In CSF, S. pneumoniae (35.1%), N. meningitidis (21.6%) and Hib (16.2%) were the major etiology. Staphylococcus aureus (32.9%) was the commonest blood isolate and S. pneumoniae was identified from 26 blood samples (9.3%). Overall, S. pneumoniae was the major pathogen among children <2 years of age (61.9%).

We investigated whether clinical features and WHO-recommended signs derived prior to introduction of conjugate vaccines still discriminate meningitis in young infants aged <60 days. Methods & Materials: We conducted a diagnostic performance validation study of clinical features (bulging fontanel, convulsions, axillary temperature ≥39 °C, agitation, history of fever or WHO-recommended signs) on a cohort of 5591 infants aged <60 days admitted to Kilifi County Hospital between January 2012 and December 2016. 782 infants died before lumbar puncture (LP) and were excluded as we could not ascertain their meningitis status. Definite meningitis was defined by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) results as: (1) positive culture; (2) positive microscopy; (3) positive antigen test; or (4) CSF leucocytes ≥50/μL. Results: 81/4809 admissions (1.7%) had definite meningitis (3 [3.7%] S. pneumoniae or H. influenzae) and 126 (2.6%) had possible meningitis. WHO-recommended signs had low sensitivity: 58% (95% CI: 47–69%), and specificity 57% (95% CI: 56–59%).

57,57,Pre-biologic screening in a high-risk area: Are we adhering to guidelines?,"Introduction: Newham University Hospital, Barts Health NHS Trust, serves the London Borough of Newham which had the highest incidence of tuberculosis in the UK at 78.0 per 100,000 in 2014. Newham also has the highest average annual rate of new reported acute hepatitis B infection in the UK. There have been clear guidelines on pre-biologic screening for opportunistic infections since 2014. Our aim is to assess whether patients who are on biologic therapy have been appropriately screened prior to initiation of biologic therapy. Aims & Methods: To assess whether patients who are on biologic therapy have been appropriately screened prior to initiation of biologic therapy. A retrospective review of all inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients on the biologic database was performed in November 2019. Patients who were initiated on biologics prior to the publication of guidelines in June 2014 were excluded. We evaluated whether there was evidence of the following laboratory and radiographic tests prior to the initiation of biologic therapy; hepatitis B Surface Antigen (HbsAg), hepatitis B Core Antibody (HbcAb), hepatitis C IgG, HIV I+II antibody, EBV IgG, VZV IgG, Interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) and chest X-ray. Results: The total number of patients was 63. 31 patients (49.2%) had latent tuberculosis testing with Interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) testing and two were positive. Screening with chest X-ray was better with 58.9% concordance. 36 patients had normal CXRs and one had an appearance of a granuloma. In comparison, viral screening had higher completion rates. Hepatitis B Surface Antigen (HbsAg) was sent in 53 patients (84%) and all were negative. Hepatitis B Core Antibody (HbcAb) was sent in 23 patients (36.5%) and one was positive. One patient was HbcAb positive but HbsAg negative. In terms of Hepatitis C, 51 patients (80.9%) had Hepatitis C IgG sent and all were negative. All 50 patients (79.3%) who were tested for Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV I+II antibody) were negative. Ebstein Bar Virus IgG was sent in 20 patients (31.7%), out of which, 15 were negative.

The aims of this study were to evaluate vaccinations, immunization status, and consequent therapeutic management in children with IBD and to analyze the differences among patients diagnosed before (Group 1) and after June 2012 (Group 2). Methods: This was a multicenter, retrospective cohort investigation. Between July 2016 and July 2017, 430 children with IBD were enrolled in 13 centers. Diagnosis, therapeutic history, vaccinations, and immunization status screening at diagnosis and at immunosuppressant (IM)/biologic initiation and reasons for incomplete immunization were retrieved. Results: Vaccination rates at diagnosis were unsatisfactory for measles, mumps, and rubella (89.3%), Haemophilus influenzae (81.9%), meningococcus C (23.5%), chickenpox (18.4%), pneumococcus (18.6%), papillomavirus (5.9%), and rotavirus (1.9%).

Testing was restricted to patients with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pleocytosis. Positive ME panel results were confirmed before reporting through correlation with direct staining (Gram and calcofluor white) and CSF cryptococcal antigen or by repeat ME panel testing. Outcomes included the ME panel test utilization rate, negative predictive value of nonpleocytic CSF samples, test yield and false-positivity rate, and time to appropriate deescalation of acyclovir. Restricting testing to pleocytic CSF samples reduced ME panel utilization by 42.7% (263 versus 459 tests performed) and increased the test yield by 61.8% (18.6% versus 11.5% positivity rate; P<0.01) with the application of criteria.

Methods: Retrospective review of clinical files of patients evaluated in the infectious risk assessment in an outpatient clinic at the Infectious Diseases Unit at Hospital De Curry Cabral in Lisbon, between June 2016 and November 2019. We reviewed information regarding sex, age, origin, occupation, past travels as well as plans of future ones, contact with live animals, intake of unpasteurized products or unsafe drinking water, along with relevant data regarding past medical history and previous and/or ongoing treatments, including immunomodulatory ones. Results: During the established timeline,1305 appointments were carried out, corresponding to a total of 415 patients. The majority of patients were female (263; 63.7%), the average age was 50 years and 82% were of Portuguese nationality. The most frequent groups of diseases were autoimmune/inflammatory (84.1%) and demyelinating (10.1%). At the date of the first consultation, 70% were already under immunosuppression. Screening for latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) was done in 99% of the patients (n = 410) and treatment was proposed to 160 patients (38.5%). At the time of screening, 56,8% of the patients were under immunossuppressive therapies, which included high doses of systemic corticosteroids (37%), anti-TNF alpha (7,7%) and combine therapy with non-biologic agents. Active disease was diagnosed and treated in two patients. Interferon gamma release assay test (IGRA) was positive in 56.8% of patients (n = 91), negative in 32.5% (n = 52) and indeterminate in 7.5% (n=12). Of the 69 patients (43%) with indeterminate/negative or not performed IGRA, Mantoux test (TST) was positive in 48 patients. In the remainder, the treatment proposal for LTBI was based on clinical, epidemiological or radiological signs suggestive of past infection. In order to prevent hyperinfection/disseminated strongyloidiasis, 354 individuals were screened with Strongyloides stercoralis serology, of which 51 patients (14.4%) had a positive result and were treated with ivermectin. Regarding vaccination, the recommendation for annual influenza vaccination was reinforced, together with the prevention of invasive pneumococcal disease. In view of future travelling plans, vaccination against yellow fever (n = 10), meningococcal disease (n = 7), typhoid fever (n = 6), and polio (n = 2) was recommended.

We assessed the molecular epidemiology, incidence and mortality of invasive neonatal GBS infections in the Netherlands. Methods: Culture positive GBS cases in patients 0-3 months old between 1987 and 2016 were identified through Netherlands Reference Laboratory for Bacterial Meningitis. Serotyping was performed by latex agglutination. Sequence types (ST) were determined using whole genome sequencing. Outcome data was obtained through the Municipal Personal Records Database. Results: 1396 episodes in 1386 patients were identified; 177 (13%) were cultured from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), 344 (25%) from CSF and blood, and 875 (63%) from blood only. The annual incidence of meningitis remained stable, due to a decline in ST19 cases (b=-0.001, p<0.001) with a concurrent non-significant increase of ST17. The incidence of sepsis increased from 0.06 in 1987 to 0.29 per 1000 livebirths in 2016 (b=0.009, p<0.001), mainly due to a rise in ST17 (b=0.003, p<0.001).

It is an uncommon complication of bacterial meningitis, and it is usually diagnosed with a CT head. Bacterial pneumocephalus in the setting of influenza B virus infection is an extremely rare complication; however, vaccination against influenza and early diagnosis and treatment help prevent mortality. Case Report: A 51-year-old woman presented to the Emergency Department in early winter because of worsening mental status over seven days prior to presentation. She was not vaccinated against influenza. Before and upon presentation to our facility, she was diagnosed with influenza B virus infection and was positive for streptococcal meningitis.

77,77,Meningitis is a rare complication of critically ill patients with severe pneumococcal community-acquired pneumonia,"Rationale: Severe pneumococcal community-acquired pneumonia (PCAP) is a frequent infection requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Pneumococcal meningitis associated with PCAP has been reported and could worsen the prognosis of patients. However, this complication is diffcult to predict and lumbar puncture is not systematically performed, regardless the severity of PCAP. Thus, we investigated the characteristics of patients with PCAP associated with pneumococcal meningitis. Patients and methods: We retrospectively included all patients admitted for PCAP in our ICU between 2006 (inception of our electronic medical sheet) and the end of 2018. Community-acquired pneumonia was defned according to the criteria of the American Thoracic Society. We excluded all patients admitted in ICU with initial suspicion of meningitis. Variables regarding epidemiology, clinical and microbiological characteristics, management and prognosis of these patients were collected and analyzed. Results: Among the 264 patients admitted for PCAP (62 ± 17 years old, SAPS II 55 ± 22, 59% of men), 59% of the patients required mechanical ventilation and 29% vasopressors infusion. The ICU mortality was 16%. S. pneumoniae was documented by a positive antigen test in 81% of the patient and/or by a positive sputum smear, tracheal aspirate or distal protected airway specimen in 54% of the patients, and/or by pleural aspirate in 5% of the patients and/or by positive blood culture in 32% (n = 84) of the patients.

We investigated how IS affects Diphtheria IgG (DIgG), Tetanus IgG (TIgG), Varicella zoster IgG (VZVIgG) and Pneumococcal specific IgG and IgM (PnIgG/PnIgM) levels after kidney transplantation. Methods: We examined serum antibody levels in 93 KTRs using a quantitative ELISA (www.bindingsite.com) at the time of transplant, and at 12 weeks thereafter; 25 patients had antibody levels measured again at 48 weeks. We compared antibody titres between patients who had standard unit IS (Basiliximab induction, pulsed methylprednisolone and rapid prednisolone taper to zero; maintenance tacrolimus and MMF) without augmentation, those who had increased IS exposure due to early rejection episodes, and those who had further IS reduction due to CMV disease. Results: Patients were aged 45.7 ± 32 years; 64.5% were male. 11 (11.8%) patients had rejection within 12 weeks with increased IS; 30 (32%) patients had IS reduction due to CMV disease. There was a reduction in DIgG (base 0.189 mg/l [0.06-0.38]; 12 weeks 0.128 mg/l [0.03-0.28]; p =<0.0001) and PnIgM levels (base 138.9 mg/l [76.5-272]; 12 weeks 115.2 mg/l [64.3-272]; p = 0.02), with 14 patients falling below the protective DIgG level of 0.01 mg/L. A similar trend was seen with TIgG and PnIgG, and also a trend toward further DIgG reduction at 48 weeks in the group with increased IS, compared to an increase in antibody levels in the group with reduced IS. VZVIgG levels remained consistently high amongst each group and time point. Conclusion: In KTRs, PnIgM and DIgG levels fell 3 months post-transplant compared to baseline.

In this study, it has been tried to design an efficient subunit vaccine in order to elicit both CTL and HTL responses. The immunodominant epitopes from highly protective antigens of S. pneumoniae (PspA, CbpA, PiuA, and PhtD) were selected from different databanks, such as IEDB, PROPRED, RANKPEP, and MHCPRED.

93,93,Epidemiology and mortality of group B streptococcal meningitis in the Netherlands (1987-2016),"Background and aims: Group B streptococcus (Streptococcus agalactiae; GBS) causes meningitis in all age groups and is the most common cause in neonates. We present the long-term molecular epidemiology, incidence and mortality rate of GBS meningitis patients of all ages over the past 30 years in the Netherlands. Methods: We used nationwide surveillance data from the Netherlands Reference Laboratory for Bacterial Meningitis to identify all patients from 1987-2016. GBS meningitis was defined by a positive cerebrospinal fluid culture. Mortality data was collected through the Municipal Personal Records Database. Isolates were assessed by latex agglutination for serotyping. Multilocus sequence typing profiles were extracted from whole genome sequences and clustered into clonal complexes (CC). Results: We identified 624 episodes in 622 patients of whom 312 (52%) were male. The median age of nonneonatal patients increased (b=0.796;P=0.003) over time.

96,96,Basic science aids syphilis vaccine development: Bloodstream spreading by the syphilis spirochete treponema pallidum,"Background Treponema pallidum ssp. pallidum (Tp) causes syphilis, a sexually transmitted infection characterized by multi-stage disease and diverse symptoms. Tp undergoes rapid vascular dissemination, penetrating tissue, placental, and bloodbrain barriers to access secondary infection sites via a process that is incompletely understood. The protein Tp0751 is an adhesin on the host-facing surface of Tp that mediates adherence to endothelial cells (ECs) lining blood vessel walls. This study explores Tp movement across endothelial barriers to enhance our understanding of Tp dissemination and identify host interactions that could be targeted for vaccine development. Methods The methods of affinity chromatography and proteomics were used to identify receptor proteins on host ECs that are bound by Tp0751. Antibody inhibition studies revealed specific receptor regions required for binding. Endothelial barrier traversal was investigated with immunofluorescence and barrier permeability assays. Phosphoproteomics identified endothelial intracellular signaling pathways initiated by Tp0751 by exploring gain/loss of phosphoryl groups on proteins. Results Here we show Tp uses Tp0751 to bind the 67 kDa laminin receptor (LamR) on human EC surfaces. Importantly, the same region of LamR is also targeted by meningitis-causing bacteria including Neisseria meningitidis and Streptococcus pneuomoniae. Further molecular analyses reveal that Tp and Tp0751 disrupt the architecture of human cell-cell junctions in blood vessel walls without altering overall barrier integrity. Phosphoproteomics demonstrates that ECs exposed to Tp0751 exhibit differential phosphorylation on proteins known to promote endothelial barrier traversal by leukocytes and pathogens. Conclusion These studies suggest a common tissue invasion strategy exists for neuroinvasive pathogens and identifies an interaction that can guide vaccine development for syphilis and other neuroinvasive diseases. Further, exploring Tp barrier traversal reveals that Tp uses similar mechanisms as immune cells and neurotropic pathogens to invade tissues and cause the detrimental sequelae associated with syphilis.

If colonization was prevented through maternal immunization, a reduction in perinatal GBS disease might be possible. A GBS type III capsular polysaccharide (CPS)-tetanus toxoid conjugate (III-TT) vaccine was evaluated for safety and efficacy in preventing acquisition of GBS colonization. Methods: Healthy, nonpregnant women aged 18-40 years and screened to be GBS III vaginal and rectal culture negative were randomized to receive III-TT conjugate or tetanus diphtheria toxoid vaccine in a multicenter, observer-blinded trial. GBS vaginal and rectal cultures and blood were obtained bimonthly over 18 months. Serum concentrations of GBS III CPS-specific antibodies were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results: Among 1525 women screened, 650 were eligible for the intent-to-treat analysis. For time to first acquisition of vaginal GBS III, vaccine efficacy was 36% (95% confidence interval [CI], 1%-58%; P =. 044), and for first rectal acquisition efficacy was 43% (95% CI, 11% to 63%; P =. 014).

To inform policies and measure progress towards achieving child health targets, we estimated the annual national and state-specific childhood mortality and morbidity attributable to Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) between 2000 and 2015. Methods: In this modelling study, we used vaccine clinical trial data to estimate the proportion of pneumonia deaths attributable to pneumococcus and Hib. The proportion of meningitis deaths attributable to each pathogen was derived from pathogen-specific meningitis case fatality and bacterial meningitis case data from surveillance studies. We applied these proportions to modelled state-specific pneumonia and meningitis deaths from 2000 to 2015 prepared by the WHO Maternal and Child Epidemiology Estimation collaboration (WHO/MCEE) on the basis of verbal autopsy studies from India. The burden of clinical and severe pneumonia cases attributable to pneumococcus and Hib was ascertained with vaccine clinical trial data and state-specific all-cause pneumonia case estimates prepared by WHO/MCEE by use of risk factor prevalence data from India. Pathogen-specific meningitis cases were derived from state-level modelled pathogen-specific meningitis deaths and state-level meningitis case fatality estimates. Pneumococcal and Hib morbidity due to non-pneumonia, non-meningitis (NPNM) invasive syndromes were derived by applying the ratio of pathogen-specific NPNM cases to pathogen-specific meningitis cases to the state-level pathogen-specific meningitis cases. Mortality due to pathogen-specific NPNM was calculated with the ratio of pneumococcal and Hib meningitis case fatality to pneumococcal and Hib meningitis NPNM case fatality. Census data from India provided the population at risk. Findings: Between 2000 and 2015, estimates of pneumococcal deaths in Indian children aged 1–59 months fell from 166 000 (uncertainty range [UR] 110 000–198 000) to 68 700 (44 600–86 000), while Hib deaths fell from 82 600 (52 300–112 000) to 15 600 (9800–21 500), representing a 58% (UR 22–78) decline in pneumococcal deaths and an 81% (59–91) decline in Hib deaths. In 2015, national mortality rates in children aged 1–59 months were 56 (UR 37–71) per 100 000 for pneumococcal infection and 13 (UR 8–18) per 100 000 for Hib. Uttar Pradesh (18 900 [UR 12 300–23 600]) and Bihar (8600 [5600–10 700]) had the highest numbers of pneumococcal deaths in 2015. Uttar Pradesh (9300 [UR 5900–12 700]) and Odisha (1100 [700–1500]) had the highest numbers of Hib deaths in 2015. Less conservative assumptions related to the proportion of pneumonia deaths attributable to pneumococcus indicate that as many as 118 000 (UR 69 000–140 000) total pneumococcal deaths could have occurred in 2015 in India.

102,102,Evaluation of BioFire Film Array Meningitis/Encephalitis (ME) panel in testing of CSF specimen of patients of meningoencephalitis in Indian scenario,"Objective: To evaluate the performance of CSF BioFire Film Array Meningitis/ Encephalitis panel in patients presenting with meningoencephalitis at a tertiary care hospital in New Delhi, India. Background: CSF microbial analysis, an important part of evaluation of meningoencephalitis, consists of gram and ZN staining, india ink preparation, serology and culture. This requires large volume sampling, consumes precious time (many hours to days) and may lack sensitivity/specificity for certain pathogens. Biofire Film Array ME panel requires very small volume sample, is rapid (1-1.5 hours) and detects 14 pathogens directly from CSF specimens by PCR amplification technique including Escherichia coli K1, Hemophilus influenzae, Listeria monocytogenes, Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Cytomegalovirus, Enterovirus, HSV1, HSV2, HHV6, VZV, Human parechovirus, cryptococcus neoformans/gattii. Design/Methods: 256 consecutive cases of meningo-encephalitis underwent CSF Biofire (ME) panel testing. These cases were selected from April 2017 to August 2018 at Sir Gangaram Hospital, New Delhi, India. Results: Total detection rate with ME BioFire panel was only 8.2% (20 cases including 1 case of coinfection, thus making 21 isolates). Viral detection rate was 71.4% followed by Bacterial (19%) and fungal (9.5%). Most common bacterial infection detected was Streptococcus pneumoniae. Most common viruses detected were Cytomegalovirus, Enterovirus and Varicella (3 cases each). 2 samples tested cryptococcal antigen positive, but were Biofire ME panel negative. Mortality was seen in 2 cases (one case of listerial infection and one case of coinfection of Streptococcus pneumonia with HHV 6). Conclusions: Biofire FA is a novel, unique, rapid, reliable, round the clock available, easy to perform (technician handled), testing of broad range of common CNS infections. Its use will help early diagnosis, prompt treatment of patients with meningo-encephalitis, aid antimicrobial stewardship and result in improved patient outcome.

104,104,Impact of the real time PCR in the diagnosis of acute bacterial meningitis in infants in a tertiary health care center in India,"Purpose: Detection of pathogens causing acute bacterial meningitis (AMB) in infants by conventional and molecular methods (Real time PCR). Methods & Materials: 62 Cerebro spinal fluid (CSF) were collected from March, 2015 to December, 2017. All samples were processed in the department of Microbiology, AIIMS, following standard Microbiological diagnostic procedure. Culture of the CSF was performed using Blood agar and Mac Conkey agar. Brain heart infusion broth with 0.5% yeast extract was used for culture of L. monocytogenes. Bacterial antigen from CSF was detected by Latex agglutination test (LAT) using Directigen meningitis Kit (BD, USA) and DNA from CSF was extracted by using QIAamp DNA mini Kit (Qiagen). Culture, latex agglutination and Real time PCR were performed to test each sample for S. agalactiae, E. coli and L. monocytogenes. Results: Overall 62 CSF samples, 28 neonates and 34 Infants were included in this study. All samples were processed by conventional and molecular methods, 17 (27.41%) were positive for the different bacteria.

105,105,Can Obesity Alter the Immune Response to Childhood Vaccinations?,"Rationale: Obesity is a major health issue in children. It is associated with increased risk of infections and infectious morbidity. Previous studies found a decrease in protective antibody titers to hepatitis B and influenza in obese adults after vaccination. Less is known about antibody responses to routine childhood immunization in obese children. Methods: Children (8-18 yr.) who had completed routine childhood immunization were recruited. Serum samples were tested by ELISA method for antibody levels to Diphtheria, Tetanus, Haemophilus influenzae type B and Streptococcus pneumoniae, along with serum HbA1c levels. BMI% and HbA1c levels were used as a continuous variable versus antibody titer levels. Spearman rank correlation, Fisher-exact test were used for statistical analysis. Results: 43% of the children had BMI≥95% (n=69). There was an overall negative correlation between BMI and pneumococcal, diphtheria and tetanus titers, with significant correlation with S.pneumoniae serotype P3 titer (p=0.037). There was an even stronger overall negative correlation between HbA1c and pneumococcal, diphtheria, tetanus and haemophilus type B titers, with significant correlation with S.pneumoniae serotype P9N (p = 0.035), P4 (p=0.002), P8 (p=0.043), P12F (p=0.002), P19F (p=0.037), tetanus (p=0.006) and Haemophilus type B (p = 0.001) titers. Obese children had impaired pneumococcal titers (7/14 serotype titers <0.2) when compared to non-obese children (p=0.014). Conclusions: In our study, increasing BMI% and HbA1c levels is associated with overall lower vaccine titers.

We aimed to investigate whether immune responses to PCV10 serotypes were non-inferior if the second priming dose of PCV10 was delivered at a 1 month interval as opposed to a 2 month interval. Methods: We did an open-label, randomised, parallel group trial in healthy Nepalese infants aged 40–60 days at Patan Hospital, Kathmandu, Nepal. Children were eligible for inclusion if they were healthy, were born at more than or equal to 37 weeks' gestation, were residing in Kathmandu, and had not had any previous vaccinations other than BCG, and oral polio vaccine. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) by means of a computer-generated list with randomly varying permuted block sizes accessed through a validated web-based interface, to receive PCV10 either at 6 weeks and 10 weeks of age (6 + 10 group) or at 6 weeks and 14 weeks of age (6 + 14 group), with both groups receiving a booster at 9 months of age. Laboratory staff, masked to study intervention, analysed serum samples for antibodies against PCV10 serotypes by ELISA. The primary outcome was to determine whether the 6 + 10 schedule was non-inferior to the 6 + 14 schedule at 9 months of age, on the basis of the proportion of infants with serotype-specific IgG greater than or equal to 0·35 μg/mL. Non-inferiority was established with a 10% margin, and the primary endpoint was measured in a modified intention-to-treat population, which included only participants who successfully had a blood sample collected.

Knowledge of the specific pathogen causing the disease is essential to guide appropriate hospital treatment and inform future vaccine strategy. However, the aetiology of CNS infections, in much of Indonesia, including Yogyakarta, is frequently unknown. Methods: A prospective hospital-based study was conducted in children aged 1 month-18 years at Dr Sardjito Hospital, a large tertiary referral hospital in Yogyakarta, from February 2015-2018. We introduced systematic testing of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), including pathogen-specific PCR and antibody tests to identify causative pathogens into the local laboratory (to supplement routine microbiology culture). Results: We recruited 355 children with clinically suspected CNS infections. CSF specimens were obtained from 242 children, 121 had CSF pleocytosis (leucocyte count of >4 cells/mm3). Fifty-one children (51/121 [42%]) died in hospital. Pathogens were detected in 51 cases; 13 by routine culture, 26 by pathogen specific PCR and 12 by antibody testing. We have identified new cases of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Streptococcus agalactiae.

Here, through comparative genome analyses of invasive and non-invasive ST283 strains, we identified a truncated DNA-binding regulator of a two-component system in a non-invasive strain that was homologous to Bacillus subtilis bceR, encoding the bceRSAB response regulator, which was conserved among GBS strains. Using isogenic knockout and complementation mutants of the ST283 strain, we demonstrated that resistance to bacitracin and the human antimicrobial peptide cathelicidin LL-37 was reduced in the ΔbceR strain with MICs changing from 64 and 256 μg/ml to 0.25 and 64 μg/ml, respectively. Further, the ATP-binding cassette transporter was upregulated by sub-inhibitory concentrations of bacitracin in the wild-type strain. Upregulation of dltA in the wild-type strain was also observed and thought to explain the increased resistance to antimicrobial peptides. DltA, an enzyme involved in D-alanylation during the synthesis of wall teichoic acids, which mediates reduced antimicrobial susceptibility, was previously shown to be regulated by the bceR-type regulator in Staphylococcus aureus.

Although the success of Spn as a pathogen can be attributed to its ability to synthesize and regulate capsular polysaccharide (CPS) for survival in the host, the mechanisms of CPS regulation are not well-described. Recent studies from our lab demonstrate that deletion of a putative polyamine biosynthesis gene (ΔcadA) in Spn TIGR4 results in the loss of the capsule. In this study, we characterized the transcriptome and metabolome of ΔcadA and identified specific mechanisms that could explain the regulatory role of polyamines in pneumococcal CPS biosynthesis. Our data indicate that impaired polyamine synthesis impacts galactose to glucose interconversion via the Leloir pathway which limits the availability of UDP-galactose, a precursor of serotype 4 CPS, and UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc), a nucleotide sugar precursor that is at the intersection of CPS and peptidoglycan repeat unit biosynthesis. Reduced carbon flux through glycolysis, coupled with altered fate of glycolytic intermediates further supports impaired synthesis of UDP-GlcNAc.

116,116,A recombinant conjugated pneumococcal vaccine that protects against murine infections with a similar efficacy to Prevnar-13,"The pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) strongly protects against vaccine serotypes, but the rapid expansion of non-vaccine serotype disease and the vaccine’s high expense has reduced its overall impact. We have developed Protein Glycan Coupling Technology (PGCT) as a flexible methodology for making low-cost polysaccharide/protein glycoconjugates recombinantly in Escherichia coli. We have used PGCT to make a recombinant PCV containing serotype 4 capsular polysaccharide linked to the Streptococcus pneumoniae proteins NanA, PiuA, and Sp0148. The introduction of the Campylobacter jejuni UDP-glucose 4-epimerase gene GalE (gne) into E. coli improved the yield of the resulting glycoprotein. PGCT glycoconjugate vaccination generated strong antibody responses in mice to both the capsule and the carrier protein antigens, with the PiuA/capsule glycoconjugate inducing similar anti-capsular antibody responses as the commercial PCV Prevnar-13. Antibody responses to PGCT glycoconjugates opsonised S. pneumoniae and Streptococcus mitis expressing the serotype 4 capsule and promoted neutrophil phagocytosis of S. pneumoniae to a similar level as antisera generated by vaccination with Prevnar-13. Vaccination with the PGCT glycoconjugates protected mice against meningitis and septicaemia with the same efficacy as vaccination with Prevnar-13. In addition, vaccination with the protein antigen components from PGCT glycoconjugates alone provided partial protection against septicaemia and colonisation.

Modifications of pharmacokinetic parameters could lead to low drug concentrations and therefore, insufficient therapeutic levels. Objective: The aim of this study was to build a population pharmacokinetic model for cefotaxime and its metabolite desacetylcefotaxime in order to optimize individual dosing regimens for critically ill children. Methods: All children aged < 18 years, weighing more than 2.5 kg, and receiving intermittent cefotaxime infusions were included in this study. Cefotaxime and desacetylcefotaxime were quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography. Pharmacokinetics were described using the non-linear mixed-effect modeling software MONOLIX, and Monte Carlo simulations were used to optimize dosing regimen in order to maintain serum concentrations above the target concentration (defined at 2 mg·L−1) throughout the dosing interval. Results: We included 49 children with a median (range) postnatal age of 23.7 (0.2–229) months, and median body weight (range) of 10.9 (2.5–68) kg. A one-compartment model with first-order elimination adequately described the data. Median (range) values for cefotaxime clearance, desacetylcefotaxime clearance, and volume of distribution were 0.97 (0.3–7.1) L·h−1, 3.2 (0.6–16.3) L·h−1, and 0.3 (0.2–0.41) L·kg−1, respectively.

Unlike intermittent administration, a dosing regimen of 100 mg·kg−1·day−1 administered by continuous infusion provided a probability of target attainment of 100%, regardless of age and weight. Conclusions: Standard intermittent cefotaxime dosing regimens in critically ill children are not adequate to reach the target. We showed that, for the same daily dose, continuous infusion was the only administration that enabled the target to be attained, for children over 1 month of age.

The patient also experienced meningitis and pneumonia caused by the same germ, suffering from the triad described by Robert Austrian. The syndrome generally affects the aortic valve and it is currently regarded as a clinical rarity. Case: 52 year old male patient, under enalapril and amlodipine treatment for hypertension. No history of cardiovascular disease. The patient was admitted to the emergency room in a state of disorientation and consciousness impairment. The physical exam showed a blood pressure of 80/30 mmHg, heart rate of 105 bpm. Breathing rate of 20 rpm, temperature of 39.8°C. Bradypsychia, disorientated, and positive Kerning sign. Blood test showed anemia, acid-base status reflecting metabolic acidosis with respiratory alkalosis. Blood cultures for Streptococcus pneumoniae were performed. Cerebrospinal fluid with Streptococcus pneumoniae growth was cultured. Positive latex test for the same germ. Imaging: Chest CT showed bilateral laminar pleural effusion. Bilateral images in ground-glass, with reticular and nodular opacification. Transesophageal echocardiogram with broadly unstructured aortic valve with multiple associated masses and severe reflux. Abscess in the aortic root with discrete expansion of the left coronary sinus. Degenerative and mildly deteriorated mitral valve. Evolution: Antibiotic treatment with ceftriaxone/vancomycin was administered. The patient evolved with signs of heart failure and subsequent tachypnea, inotropic drugs were required; poor ventilation mechanics leading to mechanical ventilation.

124,124,Potential targets for next generation antimicrobial glycoconjugate vaccines,"Cell surface carbohydrates have been proven optimal targets for vaccine development. Conjugation of polysaccharides to a carrier protein triggers a T-cell-dependent immune response to the glycan moiety. Licensed glycoconjugate vaccines are produced by chemical conjugation of capsular polysaccharides to prevent meningitis caused by meningococcus, pneumococcus and Haemophilus influenzae type b. However, other classes of carbohydrates (O-antigens, exopolysaccharides, wall/teichoic acids) represent attractive targets for developing vaccines. Recent analysis from WHO/CHO underpins alarming concern toward antibiotic-resistant bacteria, such as the so called ESKAPE pathogens (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter spp.) and additional pathogens such as Clostridium difficile and Group A Streptococcus. Fungal infections are also becoming increasingly invasive for immunocompromised patients or hospitalized individuals.

The aim of this study is to review data on neurosyphilis in Africa since the onset of the HIV epidemic. Methods: We searched the literature for references on neurosyphilis in Africa for studies published between the 1stof January 1990 and 15thFebruary 2017. We included case reports, case series, and retrospective and prospective cohort and case-control studies. We did not limit inclusion based on the diagnostic criteria used for neurosyphilis. For retrospective and prospective cohorts, we calculated the proportion of study participants who were diagnosed with neurosyphilis according to the individual study criteria. Depending on the study, we assessed the proportion of patients with syphilis found to have neurosyphilis, and the proportion of patients with neurological syndromes who had neurosyphilis.

140,140,Role of Rifampin in Reducing Inflammation and Neuronal Damage in Childhood Bacterial Meningitis: A Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial,"Background: Treatment of acute bacterial meningitis in children with bactericidal antibiotics causes cell wall lysis and a surge in inflammatory cascade, which in turn contributes to neuronal damage and morbidity. Pretreatment with a nonbacteriolytic antibiotic, such as rifampin, has been shown to attenuate the inflammatory response in experimental models of bacterial meningitis. In a pilot study, in children with bacterial meningitis, we have studied markers of inflammatory response and neuronal damage in 2 groups of children with bacterial meningitis; one group received rifampin pretreatment with ceftriaxone and the other group received ceftriaxone alone. Patients and Methods: Forty children with bacterial meningitis, who were 3 months to 12 years of age, were randomly assigned to receive either a single dose rifampin (20 mg/kg) 30 minutes before ceftriaxone or ceftriaxone alone was given. The primary outcome variables were cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), S100B and neuron-specific enolase on day 1 and day 5, and secondary outcome variables were the values of TNFα and interleukin 6 in serum on day 1 and day 5; hearing and neurologic sequelae at 3 months after recovery from the illness. Results: Children in rifampin pretreatment group had significantly lower CSF TNFα concentrations [median (interquartile range [IQR]): 15.5 (7.2-22.0) vs. 53.0 (9.0-87.5) pg/mL, P = 0.019] and S100B [median (IQR): 145.0 (54.7-450.0) vs. 447.5 (221.0-804.6) pg/mL, P = 0.033] on day 1 and S100B [median (IQR): 109.7 (64.0-287.0) vs. 322 (106.7-578.0) pg/mL, P = 0.048] and neuron-specific enolase [median (IQR): 8.6 (5-14.75) vs. 18.2 (7.0-28.75) ng/mL, P = 0.035] on day 5 when compared with ceftriaxone alone group. The rifampin-treated group also had reduced morbidity and neurologic sequelae; however, these were not statistically significant.

141,141,Disease burden and antimicrobial resistance of invasive group B streptococcus among infants in China: A protocol for a national prospective observational study,"Background: Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is a cause of neonatal sepsis, pneumonia, and meningitis that can lead to neurological sequelae in infants less than 3 months of age. The GBS disease burden is not known in China, therefore it cannot receive major attention. The main objectives of this study are the evaluation of the incidence of neonatal GBS infection, GBS case-fatality ratio, its serotypes and genotypes, bacterial resistance, clinical treatment and outcomes in China. Methods: We are conducting a nation-wide, population-based, multi-center, prospective, observational cohort study in China from May 2016 to December 2017. Eighteen large urban tertiary care hospitals from 16 provinces were selected that cover the eastern, southern, western, northern and central regions of China. Meanwhile, we retrospectively collected data and GBS strains from January 2015 to April 2016 from selected hospitals. The incidence rate per 1000 live births will be defined as the total number of confirmed GBS cases born in the selected hospitals divided by the number of live births in the hospitals during the study period. All GBS cases detected in selected hospitals will be used to calculate the case-fatality ratio and for the typing analysis. GBS isolates will be serotyped using the Strep-B-Latex® rapid latex agglutination test for serotyping of Group B streptococci. Multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) will be performed by sequencing the internal fragments of seven house-keeping genes. Antimicrobial susceptibility will be tested per interpretive standards established by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. The presence of the common resistance genes ermA, ermB, mefA, tetI, tetO and tetM will be tested by PCR. Discussion: We are conducting the first national study to estimate the invasive GBS disease burden and antimicrobial resistance of GBS among infants in China. Study findings will provide important evidence for improving clinical practice to ensure timely diagnosis of GBS disease and decisions for preventive measures.

143,143,Memory B cell response to a PCV-13 booster in 3.5 year old children primed with either PCV-7 or PCV-13,"Pneumococcal protein-polysaccharide conjugate vaccines provide direct protection against Streptococcus pneumoniae through the induction of persistent anti-polysaccharide antibodies, and by priming for a rapid secondary antibody response. Memory B cells (BMEM) generated during an initial immune response are responsible for both the more rapid and quantitatively greater secondary antibody response and are also thought to contribute to the ongoing production of plasma cells providing long-term antibody persistence. We recruited 3.5-year-old children who had participated in a previous clinical trial comparing infant immunization with either a 7-valent (PCV-7) or a 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV-13) to investigate whether prior priming with pneumococcal antigens influences BMEM responses. Blood was taken before and 1 month after a PCV-13 booster. BMEM were quantified using a cultured ELISpot assay for pneumococcal serotypes 1, 3, 4, 14, 19A, 23F, and with diphtheria and tetanus toxoid as controls, and then correlated with serotype-specific IgG concentrations and opsonophagocytic activity (OPA) titers. In total, blood samples from 62 participants were available for analysis. Serotype-specific BMEM frequencies were generally low at baseline (before boost) although for serotypes 14 and 3, they were significantly higher in children primed with PCV-13 than PCV-7 primed children. Following the PCV-13 booster, BMEM frequencies increased and were not different between the groups for all serotypes. A strong inverse correlation was found between antibody concentrations and OPA titers at baseline and BMEM following booster vaccination for serotype 3 but not for other serotypes suggesting that, for this serotype, pre-existing serotype-specific antibodies may inhibit BMEM formation in response to vaccination.

The aims of this study were to describe the compliance with ESPGHAN recommendations for vaccination and immunization status in IBD children and to evaluate differences among patients diagnosed before and after June 2012. Methods: This retrospective, multicentre study included 12 pediatric IBD referral centres. Each center was asked to retrospectively collect the following data from children with a diagnosis of IBD before and after June 2012: demographic details, diagnosis characteristics, therapies, vaccinations and immunization status at diagnosis and at the start of immunosuppressants (IM) and biologics, reasons for incomplete immunization and decision making on IM and biologics. Results: Three-hundred-ninety-four IBD children [M/F: 224/170; Median age at enrolment: 15 years; Crohn's Disease (CD): 218; Ulcerative Colitis (UC): 164; Inflammatory Bowel Disease Unclassified (IBD-U): 12] were enrolled between May and November 2016.

149,149,Maternal ART associated with improved protective transplacental antibody transfer,"Background: Transplacental transfer of pathogen-specific IgG antibodies is deficient in HIV-exposed uninfected (HEU) infants and may contribute to observed 2 to 5-fold increase in early infant mortality. We sought to determine whether maternal ART improves this deficit. Methods: We utilized paired mother-infant serum specimens drawn within 7 days of birth from an observational study of HIV-infected pregnant women during transition from Option A to Option B+ in Botswana. Levels of IgG specific to pertussis, diphtheria, and tetanus toxoids, hepatitis B surface antigen, and capsular polysaccharides of H. influenzae type b and 13 types of S. pneumoniae (1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, and 23F) were measured by multiplex immune assay. Multivariable linear and Poisson models included adjustment for maternal CD4, age, and socioeconomic factors. Results: Of 439 enrolled mothers receiving either zidovudine or ART in pregnancy, specimens were analyzable from 157 mother-infant pairs (49 ART-exposed) and an additional 34 infants (16 ART-exposed). There were no significant differences in specimen availability by ART exposure (p=0.60). Mothers received median of 2.4 months of zidovudine (IQR 2.0 to 2.8 months) or 22.3 months of ART (IQR 3.3 to 47.3 months) prior to delivery. CD4 cell count was higher for women receiving zidovudine than ART- median 448 and 421 cells/ μL, respectively (p=0.023). Maternal ART was not associated with higher pathogen-specific IgG titers in maternal sera. However, in adjusted analyses, maternal ART was associated with 53% (95%CI 30 to 75%, p<0.001) improvement in the placental transfer ratio (infant/maternal pathogen-specific IgG titer) and 35% (95%CI 15 to 67%, p=0.016) increase in infant pathogen-specific IgG concentrations compared with zidovudine. The effect of ART placental transfer was similar in mothers initiating ART prior to or during pregnancy (p=0.35 for interaction). In adjusted individual IgG analyses, ART was associated with improved placental transfer for all antibodies except H. influenzae type b (Figure). Maternal ART had a greater effect on transplacental transfer of antibodies to S. pneumoniae types (61% increase, p=0.003 for interaction).

151,151,Production and purification of an untagged recombinant pneumococcal surface protein A (PspA4Pro) with high-purity and low endotoxin content,"Streptococcus pneumoniae is the main cause of pneumonia, meningitis, and other conditions that kill thousands of children every year worldwide. The replacement of pneumococcal serotypes among the vaccinated population has evidenced the need for new vaccines with broader coverage and driven the research for protein-based vaccines. Pneumococcal surface protein A (PspA) protects S. pneumoniae from the bactericidal effect of human apolactoferrin and prevents complement deposition. Several studies indicate that PspA is a very promising target for novel vaccine formulations. Here we describe a production and purification process for an untagged recombinant fragment of PspA from clade 4 (PspA4Pro), which has been shown to be cross-reactive with several PspA variants. PspA4Pro was obtained using lactose as inducer in Phytone auto-induction batch or glycerol limited fed-batch in 5-L bioreactor. The purification process includes two novel steps: (i) clarification using a cationic detergent to precipitate contaminant proteins, nucleic acids, and other negatively charged molecules as the lipopolysaccharide, which is the major endotoxin; and (ii) cryoprecipitation that eliminates aggregates and contaminants, which precipitate at −20 °C and pH 4.0, leaving PspA4Pro in the supernatant. The final process consisted of cell rupture in a continuous high-pressure homogenizer, clarification, anion exchange chromatography, cryoprecipitation, and cation exchange chromatography. This process avoided costly tag removal steps and recovered 35.3 ± 2.5% of PspA4Pro with 97.8 ± 0.36% purity and reduced endotoxin concentration by >99.9%.

We present a novel case of Austrian Syndrome whose diagnosis was made with a positive cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) SP antigen. Case Presentation A 54 year old barber with no past medical history presented with arthralgia, headache, dry cough and breathlessness for 3 days. He had no fever, photophobia or neurological deficits. Systemic examination was normal. His inflammatory markers were markedly elevated. Chest X ray (CXR) showed left lower zone consolidation. Computed Tomography (CT) scan of the brain was normal. He was treated for community acquired pneumonia with ceftriaxone which was started in the emergency department (ED). A CT scan of the thorax, abdomen and pelvis confirmed left lower lobe consolidation with no other source of infection. The patient's clinical course deteriorated. He developed right hemiparesis (power 3/5) 3 days after admission which was complicated by 2 episodes of generalized tonic clonic seizures. A new grade 3/5 end diastolic murmur was noted. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed lepto and pachymeningitis in the left temporal and parietal lobes. Lumbar puncture revealed a bacterial analysis with clear fluid, white cell count of 225 unit/mm3 with a neutrophilic predominance of 80%, protein 1.45g/L and glucose 1.3mmol/L. CSF was positive for SP antigen but both CSF cultures and blood cultures were negative. Transesophageal echocardiography showed large vegetations (15mm-25mm) on all 4 cardiac valves (image attached). The main threat was from perforation of the non coronary cusp of the aortic valve leading to severe acute aortic regurgitation as well as fistulation into the right atrium. He rapidly developed acute heart failure needing inotropic and ventilator support. Cardiothoracic review for emergency valvular surgery was sought but the patient's family declined further invasive intervention. He eventually demised from multiorgan failure. Discussion The diagnosis of Austrian syndrome requires a high index of suspicion. Only the CSF SP antigen revealed the organism.

The aim of this study was to demonstrate non-inferiority of the immunogenicity of investigational PHiD-CV 4-dose versus licensed 1-dose vial presentation in infants. Materials and methods In this phase III, observer-blind study (NCT02447432) conducted in Bangladesh, 6-10-week-old infants, randomized 1:1, received PHiD-CV primary vaccination at ages 6/10/18 weeks with either 4-dose (4-dose group) or 1-dosevial (preservative-free, 1-dose group). DTPw-HBV/Hib and polio vaccines were (co)-administered at ages 6/10 weeks. Immune responses (antibodies against pneumococcal serotypes [22F-ELISA] and opsonophagocytic activity [OPA]; anti-protein D antibodies [ELISA]) were measured. Non-inferiority of PHiD-CV 4-dose versus 1-dose for each vaccine pneumococcal serotype (VT) and vaccine-related serotype 19A (confirmatory objectives) in terms of antibody geometric mean concentration (GMC) ratios was assessed. Results Of 320 vaccinees, 154 (4-dose) and 146 (1-dose) were included in the according-to-protocol cohort for immunogenicity. Non-inferiority criterion (upper limit of 2-sided 95% confidence interval of the antibody GMC ratios [1-dose/4-dose] <2-fold) was met for each VT and 19A. For each VT, ≥97.9% of infants in each group had antibody concentrations ≥0.2 μg/mL, except for 6B (84.4%, 4-dose; 84.9%, 1-dose) and 23F (89.0%, 4-dose; 94.5%, 1-dose); for 19A, ≥80.1% of infants in both groups.

DTPw-HBV/Hib and polio vaccines were (co)-administered at ages 6/10 weeks. Immune responses (antibodies against pneumococcal serotypes [22F-ELISA] and opsonophagocytic activity [OPA]; anti-protein D antibodies [ELISA]) were measured. Non-inferiority of PHiD-CV 4-dose versus 1-dose for each vaccine pneumococcal serotype (VT) and vaccine-related serotype 19A (confirmatory objectives) in terms of antibody geometric mean concentration (GMC) ratios was assessed. Results Of 320 vaccinees, 154 (4-dose) and 146 (1-dose) were included in the according-to-protocol cohort for immunogenicity. Non-inferiority criterion (upper limit of 2-sided 95% confidence interval of the antibody GMC ratios [1-dose/4-dose] <2-fold) was met for each VT and 19A. For each VT, ≥97.9% of infants in each group had antibody concentrations ≥0.2 μg/mL, except for 6B (84.4%, 4-dose; 84.9%, 1-dose) and 23F (89.0%, 4-dose; 94.5%, 1-dose); for 19A, ≥80.1% of infants in both groups. OPA for each VT and 19A, and anti-protein D responses were within similar ranges between groups.

163,163,Molecular-based assays reveal streptococcus pneumoniae as the lead etiological agent in the ongoing meningitis epidemic in Ghana,"Like most other countries within the meningitis belt, Ghana experiences sporadic outbreaks of bacterial meningitis frequently; however, the current epidemic in Ghana has received signifcant impact and media attention. In response to the current bacterial meningitis epidemic in Ghana, rapid diagnostic test kits such as Pastorex, a family of rapid, latex agglutination test and Gram stain are used for detecting meningitis within affected health facilities. However, these tests fail to identify the serotype of the bacteria causing the infection, which is critical to initiating population-level interventions such as vaccination. We therefore aimed to use molecular techniques to aid in the characterization of suspected agents responsible for the current epidemic of meningitis in Ghana. To determine the prevalence and etiology of meningitis, we investigated cerebrospinal fuid (CSF) specimen from 161 individuals suspected of meningitis using standard microbiological methods and a Fast Track Diagnostics (FTD, Luxemburg) real time multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. This multiplex PCR assay consists of primer/probe mix and allows simultaneous detection of N. meningitidis, S. pneumoniae and H. infuenzae. In all, 93.3% (148/161) of the cases were from the Brong-Ahafo region, while the remaining were from Greater Accra and Ashanti regions.

164,164,EGFR transactivation contributes to neuroinflammation in Streptococcus suis meningitis,"Background: Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (SS2) is an important zoonotic bacterial pathogen in both humans and animals, which can cause high morbidity and mortality. Meningitis is one of the major clinical manifestations of SS2 infection. However, the specific process of SS2 meningitis and its molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has been reported to initiate transduction of intracellular signals and regulate host inflammatory responses. Whether and how EGFR contributes to the development of S. suis meningitis are currently unknown. Methods: The tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins, the transactivation of EGFR, as well as its dimerization, and the associated signal transduction pathways were investigated by immunoprecipitation and western blotting. Real-time quantitative PCR was used to investigate the transcriptional level of the ErbB family members, EGFR-related ligands, cytokines, and chemokines. The secretion of cytokines and chemokines in the serum and brain were detected by Q-Plex™ Chemiluminescent ELISA. Results: We found an important role of EGFR in SS2 strain SC19-induced meningitis. SC19 increasingly adhered to human brain microvascular endothelial cells (hBMEC) and caused inflammatory lesions in the brain tissues, with significant induction and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the serum and brains. SC19 infection of hBMEC induced tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular EGFR in a ligand-dependent manner involving the EGF-like ligand HB-EGF, amphiregulin (AREG), and epiregulin (EREG) and led to heterodimerization of EGFR/ErbB3. The EGFR transactivation did not participate in SS2 strain SC19 adhesion of hBMEC, as well as in bacterial colonization in vivo. However, its transactivation contributed to the bacterial-induced neuroinflammation, via triggering the MAPK-ERK1/2 and NF-ΚB signaling pathways in hBMEC that promote the production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Conclusions: We investigated for the first time the tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins in response to SS2 strain SC19 infection of hBMEC and demonstrated the contribution of EGFR to SS2-induced neuroinflammation.

Methods: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimens were collected from patients with suspected meningitis in the Brong-Ahafo region. CSF specimens were subjected to Gram staining, culture and rapid antigen testing. Quantitative PCR was performed to identify pneumococcus, meningococcus and Haemophilus influenzae. Latex agglutination and molecular serotyping were performed on samples. Antibiogram and whole genome sequencing were performed on pneumococcal isolates. Results: Eight hundred eighty six patients were reported with suspected meningitis in the Brong-Ahafo region during the period of the outbreak. In the epicenter district, the prevalence was as high as 363 suspected cases per 100,000 people. Over 95 % of suspected cases occurred in non-infant children and adults, with a median age of 20 years. Bacterial meningitis was confirmed in just under a quarter of CSF specimens tested. Pneumococcus, meningococcus and Group B Streptococcus accounted for 77 %, 22 % and 1 % of confirmed cases respectively. The vast majority of serotyped pneumococci (80 %) belonged to serotype 1.

167,167,The Protective Value of Maternal Group B Streptococcus Antibodies: Quantitative and Functional Analysis of Naturally Acquired Responses to Capsular Polysaccharides and Pilus Proteins in European Maternal Sera,"Background. Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is a major cause of neonatal sepsis and meningitis. A vaccine targeting pregnant women could protect infants through placentally transferred antibodies. The association between GBS maternal antibody concentrations and the risk of neonatal infection has been investigated in US and African populations. Here we studied naturally acquired immunoglobulin G (IgG) responses to GBS capsular polysaccharides (CPS) and pilus proteins in European pregnant women. Methods. Maternal sera were prospectively collected in 8 EU countries from 473 GBS non-colonized and 984 colonized pregnant women who delivered healthy neonates and from 153 mothers of infants with GBS disease. GBS strains from these colonized women and infected infants were obtained in parallel and their capsular and pilus types were identified by serological and molecular methods. Maternal serum concentrations of IgG anti-Ia,-Ib,-III and-V polysaccharides and anti-BP-1,-AP1-2a and-BP-2b pilus proteins were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Antibody functional activity was quantified by Opsonophagocytic Killing Assay. Results. Antibody levels against CPS and pilus proteins were significantly higher in GBS colonized women delivering healthy babies than in mothers of neonates with GBS disease or non-colonized women.

168,168,Mitral valve replacement as a result of severe Streptococcus pneumoniae infection,"Acknowledgements: The authors declare that there is no potential conflict of interest. There were no external funding sources regarding this study. Informed consent was obtained from the patient for being included in the study. Introduction: Streptococcus pneumoniae is a rare cause of bacterial endocarditis in adults, accounting no more than 3 % of cases since mass production of penicillin began in the year 1943. The classic presentation is acute Austrian syndrome or Osler's triad of endocarditis, pneumonia and meningitis. The most common entry site for infection is the lung respiratory epithelia. Infrequently, pneumococcal endocarditis follows primary infection at the other extrapulmonary sites, in such case the diagnosis may be postponed because of lower index of suspicion. In spite of the available effective antimicrobial treatment this syndrome remains clinically relevant disease due to significant mortality rate which ranges between 25 and 50 %. The high mortality could be explained by destructive nature of the invasive streptococcal infection and patient factors and comorbidities rather than inadequate antibiotic treatment. Case Report: A 71-year-old female nonsmoker with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease on inhalation bronchodilator therapy was presented with abdominal pain in right upper quadrant, anorexia and vomiting for several days followed by high-grade fever. On physical exam during admission, the patient was alert and fully oriented to time, place and person. The body temperature was 38,5C, blood pressure 120/70 mmHg, heart rate 105/ minute, and respiratory rate 21/minute. Cardiac auscultation revealed no pathology and there were no meningeal signs, focal neurological deficits or peripheral stigmata of infective endocarditis. Chest X-ray revealed no obvious pathology, ECG showing sinus tachycardia. Because the clinical picture was dominated by abdominal symptoms presumable diagnosis of protracted biliary colic was considered. However due to ultrasound findings of pericholecystitis with non-obstructive gallstones and highly elevated markers of inflammation the patient was initially started on intravenous (i. v.) course of Ciprofloxacin 400 mg BID and i. v. Metronidazole 500 mg TID. Six days after admission the patient manifested headaches, vomiting altogether with mental state alteration and nuchal rigidity. The same day analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) showed 940 neutrophils, glucose 0.8 mmol/L, total protein 1.18 g/ L. Bacteriological analysis of CSF revealed Gram positive diplococci on Gram stain, latex agglutination test and later culture confirmed penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae, with negative blood culture. The therapy was changed to i. v. Ceftriaxon 2 g BID with short course of corticosteroids and Mannitol. Rapid clinical improvement of mental state and meningeal syndrome were observed. ENT examination failed to pinpoint primary infection site however follow-up chest X-ray showed right-sided pleural effusion, biochemically determined as transudate, in addition disguising postinflammatory changes in right lower lung lobe of presumptive pneumonia [figure 1]. On the day 16 after admission the clinical course was complicated with dyspnoe and lower extremities edema - because of swift response to short course of diuretic therapy, right sided heart failure was suspected, there were neither scintigraphic signs of pulmonary embolism nor any heart murmurs. 22 days after admission patient developed severe lower back pain and MRI examination confirmed spondylodiscitis in L2/3 region, clinically without neurological sequel. Antimicrobial regimen was changed to i. v. Clindamycin 900 mg QID in line with susceptibility pattern and neurosurgeon proposed conservative approach with partial spinal stabilization. Lastly, on the day 33 after admission and 26 days of effective antipneumococcal therapy new systolic murmur was described. Transesophageal cardiac ultrasound revealed severe mitral valve regurgitation and perforation with a small vegetation on the posterior mitral leaflet lacking any evidence of abscess formation [figure 2]. The patient underwent uncomplicated mitral valve replacement with bioprosthesis C-E Perimount Ease. Microbiological examination of the valve tissue by cultivation techniques and panbacterial and panfungal PCR were (Figure Presented) negative, histology revealed myxoid edematous changes at that time lacking any inflammatory cells deposition. The patient finished 6-week course of i. v. Clindamycine therapy with a favorable outcome. Lumbar backbone MRI showed improvement and no further surgical treatment was required. The patient had an uneventful postoperative recovery and was discharged home on p. o. Clindamycin for another 2 weeks with recommended administration of pneumococcal vaccine. Discussion: The pneumococcal endocarditis is a rare clinical entity, with incidence reduced to less than 3 % after the introduction of penicillin, therefore cases and series are generally reported only in isolation. Nonetheless, the mortality rate remains steadily high with unclear effect of the increasing incidence of penicillin-resistant strains worldwide over the past years. Understanding of the high mortality rate (25 %-50 %) could provide patient factors (valvulopathy, alcohol consumption, smoking, chronic lung disease, diabetes, advanced age) as well as possible intrinsic pneumococcal factors of virulence rather than inadequate antibiotic treatment, although recurrent pneumococcal endocarditis cases have been sporadically published. The typical clinical course is predominantly acute, with rapid deterioration of patient health. The paucity of peripheral signs and symptoms of endocarditis, not commonly seen in Austrian syndrome, is accountable for delayed diagnosis and treatment. In addition cardiac and other organ complications are more rule of thumb than rarity, especially congestive heart failure, abscess formation and systemic embolization. In pneumococcal endocarditis, the native aortic valve is the most frequent location of extensive vegetations. Mitral valve involvement as seen in this case report is less frequent and usually accompanied by a subacute clinical presentation. The Penicillin remains the antibiotic of choice, but with the 28 % probability of pneumococcal meningitis development, the treatment could be initiated with a third generation cephalosporin, according to regional resistance pattern Vancomycin with or without Gentamicin might be as well the choice. To the best of author's knowledge there is no case report published at the present time describing concurrent Austrian syndrome and spondylodiscitis with microbiologically confirmed pneumococcal backbone invasion. The paucity of data regarding this particular complication and statistically predominant staphylococcal etiology explained the choice of Clindamycin antibiotic regimen in this peculiar case ultimately with favorable outcome although surgery could not be avoided. It is necessary to emphasize that thorough surgical assessment must be demanded in any pneumococcal endocarditis case with complications like abscess, large vegetation or valve (Figure Presented) perforation. Such combined medical and surgical attention has improved outcomes compared to medical treatment alone in published patient series. Pneumococcal vaccine should be administered to all patients with specific risk factors to prevent complications of invasive pneumococcal disease. The only predisposing factors seen in our patient were advanced age and chronic lung condition.",FALSE,"Mitral valve replacement as a result of severe Streptococcus pneumoniae infectionAcknowledgements: The authors declare that there is no potential conflict of interest.

On the day 16 after admission the clinical course was complicated with dyspnoe and lower extremities edema - because of swift response to short course of diuretic therapy, right sided heart failure was suspected, there were neither scintigraphic signs of pulmonary embolism nor any heart murmurs. 22 days after admission patient developed severe lower back pain and MRI examination confirmed spondylodiscitis in L2/3 region, clinically without neurological sequel. Antimicrobial regimen was changed to i. v. Clindamycin 900 mg QID in line with susceptibility pattern and neurosurgeon proposed conservative approach with partial spinal stabilization. Lastly, on the day 33 after admission and 26 days of effective antipneumococcal therapy new systolic murmur was described. Transesophageal cardiac ultrasound revealed severe mitral valve regurgitation and perforation with a small vegetation on the posterior mitral leaflet lacking any evidence of abscess formation [figure 2]. The patient underwent uncomplicated mitral valve replacement with bioprosthesis C-E Perimount Ease. Microbiological examination of the valve tissue by cultivation techniques and panbacterial and panfungal PCR were (Figure Presented) negative, histology revealed myxoid edematous changes at that time lacking any inflammatory cells deposition. The patient finished 6-week course of i. v. Clindamycine therapy with a favorable outcome. Lumbar backbone MRI showed improvement and no further surgical treatment was required. The patient had an uneventful postoperative recovery and was discharged home on p. o. Clindamycin for another 2 weeks with recommended administration of pneumococcal vaccine. Discussion: The pneumococcal endocarditis is a rare clinical entity, with incidence reduced to less than 3 % after the introduction of penicillin, therefore cases and series are generally reported only in isolation. Nonetheless, the mortality rate remains steadily high with unclear effect of the increasing incidence of penicillin-resistant strains worldwide over the past years. Understanding of the high mortality rate (25 %-50 %) could provide patient factors (valvulopathy, alcohol consumption, smoking, chronic lung disease, diabetes, advanced age) as well as possible intrinsic pneumococcal factors of virulence rather than inadequate antibiotic treatment, although recurrent pneumococcal endocarditis cases have been sporadically published. The typical clinical course is predominantly acute, with rapid deterioration of patient health. The paucity of peripheral signs and symptoms of endocarditis, not commonly seen in Austrian syndrome, is accountable for delayed diagnosis and treatment. In addition cardiac and other organ complications are more rule of thumb than rarity, especially congestive heart failure, abscess formation and systemic embolization. In pneumococcal endocarditis, the native aortic valve is the most frequent location of extensive vegetations. Mitral valve involvement as seen in this case report is less frequent and usually accompanied by a subacute clinical presentation. The Penicillin remains the antibiotic of choice, but with the 28 % probability of pneumococcal meningitis development, the treatment could be initiated with a third generation cephalosporin, according to regional resistance pattern Vancomycin with or without Gentamicin might be as well the choice. To the best of author's knowledge there is no case report published at the present time describing concurrent Austrian syndrome and spondylodiscitis with microbiologically confirmed pneumococcal backbone invasion. The paucity of data regarding this particular complication and statistically predominant staphylococcal etiology explained the choice of Clindamycin antibiotic regimen in this peculiar case ultimately with favorable outcome although surgery could not be avoided. It is necessary to emphasize that thorough surgical assessment must be demanded in any pneumococcal endocarditis case with complications like abscess, large vegetation or valve (Figure Presented) perforation. Such combined medical and surgical attention has improved outcomes compared to medical treatment alone in published patient series. Pneumococcal vaccine should be administered to all patients with specific risk factors to prevent complications of invasive pneumococcal disease.

169,169,Quick diagnose of pneumococcal meningitis in adults. Sensitivity and specificity of the Streptococcus pneumoniae antigen in CSF,"Objectives: Despite not being one of the most prevalent infections in adults, acute meningitis has a high morbidity and mortality, being in many cases a neurological emergency that can end up requiring ICU admission. One of the most common etiological agents is S. pneumoniae. Early etiologic diagnosis is important in order to administer a targeted treatment and establish prognosis. Our goal is to determine the sensitivity and specificity of the detection of S. pneumoniae antigen in CSF in the diagnosis of severe pneumococcal meningitis in adults admitted to the ICU. Materials and methods: We present 73 patients with the clinical diagnosis of CNS pathology admitted to the ICU of a tertiary hospital, during the period between 2009 and 2015. In all patients, a pneumococcal antigen by immunochromatography ( BinaxNOW® test ) in CSF was performed. The results of this test, CSF culture, Gram staining and detection of pneumococcal CRP in CSF were analyzed. Pneumococcal meningitis was diagnosed in patients who presented compatible clinical findings and CSF culture and/or positive CRP for S. pneumoniae. In 14 cases, the diagnosis of pneumococcal meningitis by culture or pneumococcal CRP in CSF was confirmed. In all cases, pneumococcus antigen was positive. Therefore, there were no false negatives. In 59 cases pneumococcal meningitis was not diagnosed, being the final diagnosis a non-pneumococcal bacterial meningitis or another pathology. In all cases, pneumococcus antigen was negative. Therefore, there were no false positives. In conclusion, in our sample of 72 patients, the sensitivity and specificity of the test for S. pneumoniae antigen in CSF was 100 %.

176,176,"Characterization of Spbhp-37, a hemoglobin-binding protein of Streptococcus pneumoniae","Streptococcus pneumoniae is a Gram-positive microorganism that is the cause of bacterial pneumonia, sinusitis and otitis media. This human pathogen also can cause invasive diseases such as meningitis, bacteremia and septicemia. Hemoglobin (Hb) and haem can support the growth and viability of S. pneumoniae as sole iron sources. Unfortunately, the acquisition mechanism of Hb and haem in this bacterium has been poorly studied. Previously we identified two proteins of 37 and 22 kDa as putative Hb- and haem-binding proteins (Spbhp-37 and Spbhp-22, respectively). The sequence of Spbhp-37 protein was database annotated as lipoprotein without any function or localization. Here it was immunolocalized in the surface cell by transmission electron microscopy using specific antibodies produced against the recombinant protein.

177,177,Identification and characterization of a unique role for EDB fibronectin in phagocytosis,"Abstract: Plasma fibronectin is a circulating protein that facilitates phagocytosis by connecting bacteria to immune cells. A fibronectin isoform, which includes a sequence of 90 AA called extra-domain B (EDB), is synthesized de novo at the messenger RNA (mRNA) level in immune cells, but the reason for its expression remains elusive. We detected an 80-fold increase in EDB-containing fibronectin in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with bacterial meningitis that was most pronounced in staphylococcal infections. A role for this isoform in phagocytosis was further suggested by enhanced EDB fibronectin release after internalization of Staphylococcus aureus in vitro. Using transgenic mouse models, we established that immune cell production of fibronectin contributes to phagocytosis, more so than circulating plasma fibronectin, and that accentuated release of EDB-containing fibronectin by immune cells improved phagocytosis. In line with this, administration of EDB fibronectin enhanced in vitro phagocytosis to a larger extent than plasma fibronectin. This enhancement was mediated by αvβ3 integrin as shown using inhibitors or cells from β3 integrin knockout mice. Thus, we identified both a novel function for EDB fibronectin in augmenting phagocytosis over circulating plasma fibronectin, as well as the mediating receptor. Our data also establish for the first time, a direct role for β3 integrin in bacterial phagocytosis in mammals.

This study focuses on the response of S. suis P1/7 to sub-inhibitory concentrations of amoxicillin. First, capsule expression was monitored by qRT-PCR when S. suis was cultivated in the presence of amoxicillin. Then, the pro-inflammatory potential of S. suis P1/7 culture supernatants or whole cells conditioned with amoxicillin was evaluated by monitoring the activation of the NF-KB pathway in monocytes and quantifying pro-inflammatory cytokines secreted by macrophages.

Bacterial meningitis affects about one fifth of the human population. Our work focuses on one type of bacteria that causes the disease, Neisseria meningitidis serogroup W. The capsule that surrounds the bacteria is carbohydrate-rich. Polysaccharides in the capsule help protect the bacteria against the human immune system. This serogroup contains sialic acid-galactose heteropolymers. The serogroup W capsule polymerase enzyme uses CMP-sialic acid and UDP-galactose as nucleotide donor sugars during synthesis of the heteropolymer. Our overall goal is to better understand the molecular mechanism of this enzyme. To help us achieve this goal, we are developing a chemoenzymatic method to produce modified CMP-sialic acid diazirine derivatives with photo crosslinking ability. These derivatives will be used to label potential enzyme active site residues. Recombinant forms of Camplyobacter jejuni sialic acid synthase and Neisseria meningitidis CMP-sialic acid synthase were used. Sialic acid synthase produces sialic acid from N-acetylmannosamine (ManNAc) and phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP). CMP-sialic acid synthetase uses cytidine 5'-triphosphate disodium salt (CTP) and sialic acid to synthesize product. Both enzymes were expressed in E. coli and a purification strategy for CMP-sialic acid synthase using nickel affinity chromatography was developed. The sialic acid synthase was used as a crude lysate. Enzyme activity was tested in a trial one pot chemoenzymatic synthesis.

Similarly, clinico-pathological factors that modify these influences, and implications for future immune health remain mainly unexplored. Methods: We used flow-cytometry to assess circulating lymphocyte levels and phenotypes in 88 primary breast cancer patients before chemotherapy and at time-points from 2 weeks to 9 months after chemotherapy completion. We examined circulating titres of antibodies against pneumococcal and tetanus antigens using ELISAs. Results: Levels of B, T and NK cells were significantly reduced 2 weeks after chemotherapy (p<0.001). B cells demonstrated particularly dramatic depletion, falling to 5.4 % of pre-chemotherapy levels. Levels of all cells recovered to some extent, although B and CD4+ T cells remained significantly depleted even 9 months post-chemotherapy (p<0.001). Phenotypes of repopulating B and CD4+ T cells were significantly different from, and showed no sign of returning to pre-chemotherapy profiles. Repopulating B cells were highly depleted in memory cells, with proportions of memory cells falling from 38 % to 10 % (p<0.001).

Meningitis and sepsis are the most frequent clinical manifestations in humans. A recently published systematic review identified 24 studies including 913 patients with meningitis due to Streptococcus suis [1]. Most cases have been reported in Asia. Objective: to draw attention to a potential under-diagnosed cause of meningitis and sepsis in our country. Methods We performed a retrospective analysis of patients diagnosed with Streptococcus suis infection between January 2005-December 2015 in one tertiary care hospital in Bucharest, Romania. We also reviewed the Steptococcus pneumoniae meningitis, according to the microbiological method confirming the etiology. Results We identified five patients hospitalized for Streptococcus suis infection - four patients had meningitis and one patient had endocarditis. Two patients reported contact with pork meat. In patients with meningitis the median age was 43 years (IQR 40-45), with a male: female ratio of 3:1. Three patients presented with altered level of consciousness and two with severe hearing impairment. Cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) examination showed changes characteristic for bacterial meningitis. Latex agglutination test for Streptococcus pneumoniae was positive in two patients, nonetheless, Streptococcus suis was isolated in CSF in all patients. They were all treated with a third generation cephalosporin for 14 days and all of them improved. Two patients developed sequelae, consisting in permanent sensorineural deafness and ataxia. In the studied period we identified a total of 194 cases of pneumococcal meningitis, in which the diagnosis was based on appearance on Gram stain and/or positive latex agglutination reaction of CSF samples in 82 (42 %) and positive culture in 112 (58 %) patients.

This study describes a duplex real-time (RT) PCR assay for detection of Neisseria meningitidis and Streptococcus pneumoniae in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for meningitis diagnosis using SYBR Green-based RT-PCR method coupled with melting curve analysis. Methodology: We used SYBR Green-based RT-PCR method coupled with melting curve analysis to detect S. pneumoniae and N. meningitidis in CSF samples. The sensitivity, specificity, and limit of detection were determined. The gold standard for routine tests of CSF analysis is direct examination, culture, and/or latex agglutination. The assay was evaluated on 132 CSF samples to measure clinical sensitivity. Results: A duplex RT-PCR assay for N. meningitidis and S. pneumoniae detection in CSF was evaluated. Two peaks at different melting temperatures (87.5°C and 85.5°C) for N. meningitidis and S. pneumoniae, respectively, were obtained. The sensitivity of RT-PCR was 100% (95% confidence limits [CI] = 82.4–100) for N. meningitidis and 100% (95% CI = 85.1–100) for S. pneumoniae. Specificity was the same (100%) for the bacteria (95% CI = 88.6–100). The percentage of cases accurately diagnosed with meningitis caused by N. meningitidis and S. pneumoniae increased to 50.7% and 28.6%, respectively, when RT-PCR was added to the standard microbiologic methods.

The sensitivity, specificity, and limit of detection were determined. The gold standard for routine tests of CSF analysis is direct examination, culture, and/or latex agglutination. The assay was evaluated on 132 CSF samples to measure clinical sensitivity. Results: A duplex RT-PCR assay for N. meningitidis and S. pneumoniae detection in CSF was evaluated. Two peaks at different melting temperatures (87.5°C and 85.5°C) for N. meningitidis and S. pneumoniae, respectively, were obtained. The sensitivity of RT-PCR was 100% (95% confidence limits [CI] = 82.4–100) for N. meningitidis and 100% (95% CI = 85.1–100) for S. pneumoniae. Specificity was the same (100%) for the bacteria (95% CI = 88.6–100). The percentage of cases accurately diagnosed with meningitis caused by N. meningitidis and S. pneumoniae increased to 50.7% and 28.6%, respectively, when RT-PCR was added to the standard microbiologic methods. Conclusions: Duplex RT-PCR and melting curve analysis with SYBR Green is an inexpensive, sensitive, and specific method to rapidly diagnose bacterial meningitis. Accurate identification of the bacterial causative agents will improve patient management and epidemiological investigations.",FALSE,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 184}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 184}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 184}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 184}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 184}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 184}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 184}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 184}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 184}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 184}",1
185,185,Low serum fetuin-a as a biomarker to predict pneumococcal necrotizing pneumonia and hemolytic uremic syndrome in children,"Streptococcus pneumoniae, a neuraminidase-producing pathogen, can cause invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) with or without hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) in humans. We aimed to identify serum sialoglycoproteins that are targeted by neuraminidases in severe pneumococcal infection. We hypothesized that serum sialoglycoprotein such as fetuin-A can serve as a biomarker to predict IPD or HUS. We constructed serum sialoglycoprotein profiles before and after pneumococcal neuraminidase treatment using liquid chromatographytandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), a proteomic approach. An observational study was conducted using clinical data and serum samples from pediatric patients with pneumococcal infection to verify the predictive role of fetuin-A in IPD. Serum fetuin-A levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The most abundant serum sialoglycoproteins identified by LC-MS/ MS after neuraminidase treatment and peanut lectin capture were immunoglobulins, apolipoproteins, fibrinogens, keratins, complement system proteins, and fetuin-A. Serum fetuin-A levels in the HUS patients were significantly lower (207±80 mg/L, P<0.001) than in patients with lobar pneumonia (610±190 mg/L) as well as the healthy controls (630±250 mg/L). In comparing HUS with necrotizing pneumonia and lobar pneumonia, the ROC area under the curve was 0.842; a cutoff value of 298 mg/L yielded sensitivity of 92.9% (95% CI: 68.5- 98.7%) and specificity of 71.9% (95% CI: 54.6-84.4%).

187,187,Antigenic distribution of streptococcus agalactiae isolates from pregnant women at garankuwa hospital - South Africa,"Introduction Streptococcus agalactiae (group B streptococcus; GBS) is globally recognised as one of the leading cause of neonatal sepsis and meningitis. It also causes adverse pregnancy outcomes such as still birth and miscarriages. Incidence of invasive disease is increasing in non-pregnant adults with underlying medical conditions (e.g., diabetes mellitus). Epidemiological studies of GBS infections are based on capsular serotyping. Genotyping of the surface anchored protein genes is also becoming an important tool for GBS studies. Currently ten different GBS serotypes have been identified. This study was performed to determine the prevalence of GBS capsular types (CTs) and surface anchored protein genes in isolates from colonized pregnant women attending antenatal clinic, at Dr George Mukhari Academic Hospital, Garankuwa, Pretoria, South Africa. Methods The samples were collected over 11 months and cultured on selective media. GBS was identified using different morphological and biochemical tests. Capsular typing was done using latex agglutination test and conventional PCR. Multiplex PCR with specific primers was used to detect the surface anchored protein genes. Results Of the 413 pregnant women recruited, 128 (30.9%) were colonized with GBS. The capsular polysaccharide (CPS) typing test showed that CPS type III (29.7%) was the most prevalent capsular type followed by CPS type Ia (25.8%), II (15.6%), IV (8.6%), V (10.9%) and Ib (8.6%); 0.7% of the isolates were nontypeable. Multiplex PCR revealed that the surface proteins genes were possessed by all the capsular types: rib (44.5%), bca (24.7%), alp2/3 (17.9%), epsilon (8.6%) and alp4 (4.7%).

As specific treatments are different, it is important to develop clinical prediction rules to distinguish aseptic from bacterial or fungal infection. In this study we evaluated the incidence rates, seasonal variety and the main etiologic agents of AME, and identified factors that could be used to predict the etiologic agents. Methods A population-based AME syndrome surveillance system was set up in Guigang City, Guangxi, involving 12 hospitals serving the study communities. All patients meeting the case definition were investigated. Blood and/or cerebrospinal fluid were tested for bacterial pathogens using culture or RT-PCR and serological tests for viruses using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Laboratory testing variables were grouped using factor analysis. Multinomial logistic regression was used to predict the etiology of AME. Results From May 2007 to June 2012, the annual incidence rate of AME syndrome, and disease specifically caused by Japanese encephalitis (JE), other viruses, bacteria and fungi were 12.55, 0.58, 4.57, 0.45 and 0.14 per 100,000 population, respectively. The top three identified viral etiologic agents were enterovirus, mumps virus, and JE virus, and for bacteria/ fungi were Streptococcus sp., Cryptococcus neoformans and Staphylococcus sp. The incidence of JE and other viruses affected younger populations and peaked from April to August. Alteration of consciousness and leukocytosis were more likely to be caused by JE, bacteria and fungi whereas CSF inflammation was associated with bacterial/fungal infection. Conclusions With limited predictive validity of symptoms and signs and routine laboratory tests, specific tests for JE virus, mumps virus and enteroviruses are required to evaluate the immunization impact and plan for further intervention.

189,189,Ifn-gamma deficiency presenting as a 20-monthold female with refractory pneumonia,"Introduction: The interferon (IFN) gamma/IL-12 pathway is integral in controlling disease from intracellular pathogens. IFN-gamma receptor deficiency is a primary immunodeficiency that is associated with both dominant and recessive mutations. Without typical IFN-gamma individuals develop severe mycobacterial, Salmonella, and certain viral infections. Furthermore, the phenotype variation amongst these patients is associated with the degree of interferon gamma responsiveness. The prognosis for these patients is poor. Case: The patient is a 20-month-old female who presented to our immunology service as a consultation for suspected primary immunodeficiency. Prior to evaluation by the service she had refractory cervical adenitis due to mycobacterium fortuitum (8 months old), recurrent stomatitis (9 months old), and varicella zoster infection after Varivax immunization (12 months old). She was ultimately admitted to the hospital for a persistent right upper lobe infiltrate with pulmonary lymph node necrosis on radiographic evaluation. The pertinent findings on her physical examination at the time of consultation were crackles in her right upper lobe on lung auscultation and an indurated lesion where her PPD was placed. Her initial laboratory evaluation showed normal T cell and B cell subsets, normal immunoglobulin levels (IgA, IgG, IgM, IgE), and protective antibody levels for tetanus, diphtheria, and streptococcus pneumonia. A sputum culture and staining revealed numerous acid-fast bacilli, however a confirmatory QuantiFERON gold assay was indeterminate in result. Despite a normal lymphocytic proliferation in response to mitogens, the patient's lymphocytes did not respond to antigens. Moreover, her NK cells showed poor function. While her IFN-gamma level was normal, an IL-12/IFN-gamma pathway defect was investigated because of her infectious history. As a result, IFN-gamma replacement and antimicrobial therapies were started. Genetic testing revealed two heterozygous mutations in the IFN-gamma receptor 1 gene confirming the defect. She has had no major illness in the last year. Conclusion: IFN-gamma's significance in preventing infections within this patient remains unclear, since she receives other additional prophylactic therapies. While these added therapies may play a major role in preventing infections, our patient remains on replacement IFN-gamma and antimicrobial therapies.",FALSE,"Ifn-gamma deficiency presenting as a 20-monthold female with refractory pneumoniaIntroduction: The interferon (IFN) gamma/IL-12 pathway is integral in controlling disease from intracellular pathogens.

190,190,Thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor influences disease severity in humans and mice with pneumococcal meningitis,"Background: Mortality and morbidity in patients with bacterial meningitis result from the proinflammatory response and dysregulation of coagulation and fibrinolysis. Thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI) is activated by free thrombin or thrombin in complex with thrombomodulin, and plays an antifibrinolytic role during fibrin clot degradation, but also has an anti-inflammatory role by inactivating proinflammatory mediators, such as complement activation products. Objective: To assess the role of TAFI in pneumococcal meningitis. Methods: We performed a prospective nationwide genetic association study in patients with bacterial meningitis, determined TAFI and complement levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and assessed the function of TAFI in a pneumococcal meningitis mouse model by using Cpb2 (TAFI) knockout mice. Results: Polymorphisms (reference sequences: rs1926447 and rs3742264) in the CPB2 gene, coding for TAFI, were related to the development of systemic complications in patients with pneumococcal meningitis. Higher protein levels of TAFI in CSF were significantly associated with CSF complement levels (C3a, iC3b, and C5b-9) and with more systemic complications in patients with bacterial meningitis. The risk allele of rs1926447 (TT) was associated with higher levels of TAFI in CSF. In the murine model, consistent with the human data, Cpb2-deficient mice had decreased disease severity, as reflected by lower mortality, and attenuated cytokine levels and bacterial outgrowth in the systemic compartment during disease, without differences in the brain compartment, as compared with wild-type mice.

CASE PRESENTATION: A 23 year-old Ghanaian woman presents with 2 weeks of productive cough and hemoptysis. She has a history of recurrent pneumonias for 4 years and childhood latent TB treated with Isoniazid. She also complains of shortness of breath, pleuritic chest pain, fevers, weight loss, and night sweats. Her mother had active TB and she loves eating crayfish. A low-grade fever and right basilar rales were appreciated on physical exam. Chest x-ray displayed a right basilar consolidation with normal laboratory investigations. Intravenous antibiotics were started and the patient was cultured. Additional workup including HIV serology, immunoglobulin testing, streptococcal pneumonia vaccine response, and an underlying autoimmune disorder were all nondiagnostic. Active TB was ruled out. Prior investigations were obtained yielding negative pathology for underlying infectious or inflammatory processes. Bronchoscopy revealed purulent and bloody secretions in the right lower lobe with negative serological and culture testing. As a result, parasitic infectious etiologies were entertained resulting in ova and parasite smears with Strongyloides and Paragonimiasis antibody titers. After a ten-day hospital course with IV antibiotics the patient had improved and her microbiological investigations revealed only a Paragonimiasis positive antibody titer with resolution of symptoms and no recurrence after a three-day course of Praziquantal. DISCUSSION: The encysted parasite is transmitted to humans by the ingestion of inadequately cooked crayfish or crab. Symptoms are various with the most common being chronic cough, hemoptysis, and fever. Early diagnosis and proper treatment is essential as this pathogen can present with TB resembling symptoms resulting in repetitive investigations, hospital readmissions, prolongation of hospital stays, and potential adverse effects of anti-tuberculosis medications. The presence of ova and parasites in sputum is specific yet sensitivity is low (28-38%), stool examination is insensitive, and pleural fluid positivity usually does not occur. Serological testing with ELISA can be useful to establish a diagnosis (Sensitive 96%, Specific 99%).

Both the 10- and 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV10 and PCV13) induce immunological memory against Streptococcus pneumoniae infections caused by vaccine serotypes. In addition to comparing serum antibody levels, we investigated frequencies of serotype-specific plasma cells (PCs) and memory B-cells (Bmems) as potential predictors of long-term immunity around the booster vaccination at 11 months of age. Methods. Infants were immunized with PCV10 or PCV13 at 2, 3, 4, and 11 months of age. Blood was collected before the 11-month booster or 7-9 days afterward. Serotype-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels were determined in serum samples by multiplex immunoassay. Circulating specific PCs and Bmems against shared serotypes 1, 6B, 7F, and 19F and against PCV13 serotypes 6A and 19A were measured in peripheral blood mononuclear cells by enzyme-linked immunospot assay. Results. No major differences in IgG levels and PC frequencies between groups were found for the 4 shared serotypes. Notably, PCV13 vaccination resulted in higher frequencies of Bmems than PCV10 vaccination, both before and after the booster dose, for all 4 shared serotypes except for serotype 1 postbooster. For PCV13-specific serotypes 6A and 19A, the IgG levels and frequencies of PCs and Bmems were higher in the PCV13 group, pre- and postbooster, except for PC frequencies prebooster. Conclusions. Both PCVs are immunogenic and induce measurable IgG, PC, and Bmem booster responses at 11 months.

Herein we describe a novel presentation of leaky RAG1 and RAG2 deficiency in two unrelated adult patients with impaired antibody production against bacterial polysaccharide antigens. Clinical manifestation included recurrent pneumonia, sinusitis, otitis media and in one patient recurrent cutaneous vasculitis. Both patients harbored a combination of a null mutation on one allele with a novel hypomorphic RAG1/2 mutation on the other allele. One of these novel mutations affected the start codon of RAG1 and resulted in an aberrant gene and protein expression. The second novel RAG2 mutation leads to a truncated RAG2 protein, lacking the C-terminus with intact core RAG2 and reduced VDJ recombination capacity as previously described in a mouse model. Both patients presented with severely decreased numbers of naïve CD4+ T cells and defective T independent IgG responses to bacterial polysaccharide antigens, while T cell-dependent IgG antibody formation e.g. after tetanus or TBEV vaccination was intact.

Total IgG levels and specific antibodies to measles, varicella, tetanus, Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (serotypes 4,6B,9V,14,18C,19F and 23F) were evaluated on maternal and cord blood samples of 23 sets of renal transplanted women and their newborns and 32 sets of healthy women-newborns at term. Total IgG levels were measured by nephelometry and specific antibodies, by ELISA. Renal transplanted mothers had lower median tetanus antibodies (0.67. IU/mL) than controls (1.53. IU/mL; p=. 0.017). Neonates from renal transplanted mothers had lower median tetanus antibodies (0.95. IU/mL) than controls (1.97. IU/mL, p=. 0.008). Antibodies to measles, varicella, Hib and the 7 serotypes of S. pneumoniae were similar between groups. Maternal antibodies were associated with an increase in neonatal antibodies for all antigens; gestational age was associated with an increase in Hib neonatal antibodies. Preeclampsia was associated with a decrease in neonatal total IgG and serotype 4 S. pneumoniae antibodies; chronic hypertension was associated with a decrease in neonatal serotype 6B S. pneumoniae antibodies.

Consensual biologic diagnosis criteria are currently lacking. Study Design and Methods A prospective study was conducted on 10 children with culture-confirmed IPD. Five presented with full-blown P-HUS, three had an incomplete form with hemolytic anemia and mild or no uremia (P-HA), and two had neither HUS nor HA. Thomsen-Friedenreich (T), Th, and Tk cryptantigens and sialic acid expression were determined on red blood cells (RBCs) with peanut (PNA), Glycine soja (SBA), Bandeiraea simplicifolia II, and Maackia amurensis lectins. Plasma concentrations of the major endogenous T-antigen-binding protein, galectin-3 (Gal-3), were analyzed. Results We found that RBCs strongly reacted with PNA and SBA lectins in all P-HUS and P-HA patients. Three P-HUS and three P-HA patients showed also concomitant Tk activation.

204,204,Clinical characteristics and antimicrobial resistance of nonvaccine serotype Streptococcus pneumoniae in Korea: A multicenter surveillance study,"Background: The purpose of this study was to determine clinical characteristics of systemic pneumococcal infections by nonvaccine serotypes (NVT). Methods: Study subjects included adult patients with non-invasive pneumococcal pneumonia (≥65 years) and invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) (≥18 years). Clinical data and pneumococcal isolates were collected from 20 participating hospitals in Korea from 2013 to 2014. Clinical characteristics (invasiveness, clinical severity, outcomes, antibiotic resistance) were compared between the NVT and the VT. Pneumococcal serotypes were determined by the immunoassay. Antibiotic susceptibility was taken by MicroScan. Results: A total of 439 cases were enrolled; the VT (n = 253) and the NVT (n = 186). Of 118 IPD, 50 cases were from the NVT with 39.2% of case fatality rate, In multivariate analyses, IPD other than bacteremia pneumonia, primary bacteremia, empyema and meningitis were significantly associated with the NVT (OR, 5.41; 95% CI, 1.13-25.64; p=0.034).

In this study it is shown that three GBS strains (COH1, NEM316, 515) have capacity to adhere to human salivary pellicle. Heterologous expression of GBS pilus island (PI) genes in Lactococcus lactis to form surface-expressed pili demonstrated that GBS PI-2a and PI-1 pili bound glycoprotein-340 (gp340), a component of salivary pellicle. By contrast, PI-2b pili did not interact with gp340. The variation was attributable to differences in capacities for backbone and ancillary protein subunits of each pilus to bind gp340. Furthermore, while GBS strains were aggregated by fluid-phase gp340, this mechanism was not mediated by pili, which displayed specificity for immobilised gp340.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE #2: Recognize and manage the complications associated with Lemierre's Syndrome. CASE: A 21-year-old Saudi-Arabian woman with a past medical history of G6PD deficiency presented to an outpatient clinic with one day of subjective fevers, fatigue and left-sided throat pain. The patient denied any associated symptoms of cough, difficulty swallowing or dyspnea. The patient had not traveled to Saudi Arabia since arriving in the United States 3 months prior and denied any other local travel, tick or mosquito exposure or additional sick contacts. Clinical exam of the oropharynx revealed mild erythema without exudate. There was no cervical lymphadenopathy or tenderness appreciated. A rapid strep test was performed and was negative for streptococcus group A. The patient was sent home with antipyretics for a presumed viral upper respiratory infection. Six days later, the patient returned to the Emergency Department with persistent fevers, malaise, sore throat and a new non-productive cough. Her exam was notable for an ill-appearing woman, tachypneic and tachycardic with a heart rate in the 130 s and a blood pressure of 100/70. Her temperature was noted to be 101.4. Oropharyngeal exam remained unremarkable. Initial workup included an elevated white blood cell count of 12.7 K/ul with a neutrophilic predominance. Lab work was also notable for a negative heterophile antibody, Lyme titer, malaria antigen test, Ehrlichia DNA PCR, HIV-1 RNA PCR and viral respiratory panel. A chest x-ray was obtained and was normal. Urine and blood cultures were sent as the patient was admitted to the medical service for further management. On hospital day 2 the patient was noted to be acutely hypoxic, dropping her oxygen saturation to 88 % despite supplementation with a non-rebreather mask. A repeat chest x-ray was obtained which revealed diffuse bilateral interstitial opacities. The patient was started on ceftriaxone and azithromycin and transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for management of noncardiogenic pulmonary edema. On transfer the ICU, preliminary blood culture data confirmed that 2/4 anaerobic bottles had grown gram-negative rods and the patient's antibiotic coverage was broadened to vancomycin and meropenem. On arrival to the ICU, the patient was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. Persistent hypotension necessitated the placement of a central venous catheter for vasopressor initiation. During catheter placement, a thrombus was seen on ultrasound of the left internal jugular vein. Of note, a computed tomography (CT) scan of the neck had been obtained the day prior with normal enhancement of all vascular structures reported. A CT of the chest also revealed cavitary subpleural lower lobe opacities concerning for septic emboli. A formal ultrasound was obtained which confirmed the presence of a partially occlusive thrombus along the posterior wall of the left internal jugular vein. A few hours later, the patient's gramnegative rod bacteremia was confirmed to be Fusobacterium necrophorum. DISCUSSION: Lemierre's Syndrome (jugular vein suppurative thrombophlebitis) is an extremely rare cause of fever and sore throat in a young woman, with only a few case reports available in the literature. Fusobacterium necrophorum is the typical pathogen associated with the syndrome, and bacteremia with this organism is an uncommon complication of Lemierre's Syndrome. As such, it is important to recognize the key features of the syndrome including fevers, chills, exudative tonsillitis, sore throat, dysphagia, cervical lymphadenopathy and unilateral neck pain in the background of a preceding pharyngeal illness. Radiographic imaging to determine the presence of septic thrombophlebitis is essential to the diagnosis, and while evidence supports CT-scan of the neck with contrast as the key imaging tool, ultrasonography can be considered on the basis of its ability to identify and assess the extent of thrombus. The mainstay of management of the various complications of Lemierre's Syndrome, including bacteremia, meningitis and metastasis to the lungs, brain, heart, GI tract, kidneys and joints, is a prolonged (up to 6 weeks) course of antibiotics.

In this reportwe present a rare case of asepticmeningitis induced by intravenous Cetuximab administration. Case report: 58 year old man with right tonsillar Squamous Cell Cancer was emergently admitted for complains of headache and fever which started one hour after his first dose of Cetuximab (800 mg), after Benadryl premedication. His remote history included HIV on HAART, hypertension and CKD stage V. On admission, the patient was febrile to 102F, with chills and a persistent headache . The headache was described as frontal and 10/10 in severity. There was no neckstiffness or photophobia, but given his immunocompromised state, there was a high suspicion for infectious meningitis. Computed tomography scan of the head was non-revealing and cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF) studies were promptly sent, showing a neutrophil predominant pleocytosis to 473 WBCs/ cu. mm (80% neutrophils) in CSF tube 1 and 500 WBCs/ cu. mm (62% neutrophils) in CSF tube 4. RBCs were 150 and 50 cells/ cu. mm respectively. CSF protein was elevated to 128 mg/dL and the glucose was normal at 66 mg/dL. Other labs including complete blood count, serum comprehensive metabolic panel and coagulation profile were within normal limits. The patient was empirically treated with Dexamethasone, Vancomycin, Ceftriaxone and Ampicillin, while awaiting CSF cultures. CSF bacterial antigens for Nisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus pneumonia, Haemophilus influenza and Cryptococcus were negative, along with a viral encephalitis panel. Symptoms resolved with supportive care. Antibiotics and dexamethasone were discontinued on Day 2 when cultures turned negative and the patient was discharged home with no additional medications on Day 4. On Day 7, patient received his second dose of Cetuximab at 250mg/m2 per planned his chemotherapy regimen, with no adverse reaction. Discussion: Aseptic meningitis in the setting of Cetuximab therapy has been reported on 6 occasions previously. In contrast to bacterial meningitis, most cases of aseptic meningitis are self-limited and resolve with supportive care. While the wide belief is that monoclonal antibodies, such as trastuzumab and cetuximab would not be able to penetrate the BBB due to their larger size, there have been reports of trastuzumab levels measured in the CSF after intravenous administration. Monoclonal antibodies have a significant role in treatment of diseases outside Oncology and Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is one such area where extensive research has been performed on the ability of these antibodies to cross the BBB while tagged to T-cells.

While the wide belief is that monoclonal antibodies, such as trastuzumab and cetuximab would not be able to penetrate the BBB due to their larger size, there have been reports of trastuzumab levels measured in the CSF after intravenous administration. Monoclonal antibodies have a significant role in treatment of diseases outside Oncology and Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is one such area where extensive research has been performed on the ability of these antibodies to cross the BBB while tagged to T-cells. Further molecular research is needed to understand th emechanism of the leak of Cetuximab into the CSF in the absence of cerebral disease and the resultant inflammatory cascade.",FALSE,"{'judgement': 'False', 'index': 208}",0,"{'judgement': 'False', 'index': 208}",0,"{'judgement': 'False', 'index': 208}",0,"{'judgement': 'False', 'index': 208}",0,"{'judgement': 'False', 'index': 208}",0,"{'judgement': 'False', 'index': 208}",0,"{'judgement': 'False', 'index': 208}",0,"{'judgement': 'False', 'index': 208}",0,"{'judgement': 'False', 'index': 208}",0,"{'judgement': 'False', 'index': 208}",0
209,209,A pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analysis of ceftaroline prophylaxis in patients with external ventricular drains,"Background: Ceftaroline is a broad-spectrum cephalosporin antibiotic with activity against drug-resistant bacteria, including strains of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and may be useful to prevent and treat ventriculostomy-related infections (VRIs). The purpose of this study was to analyze the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of prophylactic ceftaroline in neurosurgical patients with an external ventricular drain (EVD). Methods: Adult patients in the neurosurgical intensive care unit with an EVD were given prolonged prophylaxis with ceftaroline. Serum and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) were obtained simultaneously at 2, 6, and 12h after initiation of the fourth dose of ceftaroline and concentrations were measured by a liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry assay. Time-kill curves against isolates of coagulase-negative S. aureus, methicillin-sensitive S. aureus, MRSA, and Streptococcus pneumoniae were determined in serum and CSF at each collection time point. Results: A total of five patients with a mean age of 63y and mean weight of 83kg were enrolled. The mean CSF:serum penetration ratios of ceftaroline were 0.005 (0.5%), 0.021 (2.1%), and 0.043 (4.3%) at 2, 6, and 12h, respectively.

Methods: Retrospective audit of cases of meningitis from 2000 to 2009. Results: Microbiologically-confirmed diagnosis (MCD) was established in 296 of 743 episodes (40%), most commonly enterovirus (123/296, 42%), Neisseria meningitidis (43/296, 15%) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (34/296, 11%).

Surface accessible proteins of S. pneumoniae are being explored for the development of a protein-based vaccine in order to overcome the limitations of existing polysaccharidebased pneumococcal vaccines. To identify a potential vaccine candidate, we resolved surface-associated proteins of S. pneumoniae TIGR4 strain using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis followed by immunoblotting with antisera generated against whole heat-killed TIGR4. Ten immunoreactive spots were identified by mass spectrometric analysis that included a putative lipoprotein SP0845. Analysis of the inferred amino acid sequence of sp0845 homologues from 36 pneumococcal strains indicated that SP0845 was highly conserved (>98% identity) and showed less than 11% identity with any human protein. Our bioinformatic and functional analyses demonstrated that SP0845 is the substrate-binding protein of an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter that is involved in nucleoside uptake with cytidine, uridine, guanosine and inosine as the preferred substrates. Deletion of the gene encoding SP0845 renders pneumococci avirulent suggesting that it is essential for virulence.

We aimed to describe the spectrum of aetiologies and frequencies of microbiologically-confirmed fungal and bacterial meningitis among adults over 5 years in a province with an 11% HIV prevalence. Methods Data were extracted on all cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimens submitted to public-sector laboratories in Gauteng from 2009 through 2013. An incident case of cryptococcal (CM), pneumococcal (PM) or other bacterial (OBM) meningitis was defined as a person >=18 years old with meningitis confirmed by fungal or bacterial culture, or a positive India ink or cryptococcal antigen test for CM. Tuberculous meningitis was excluded. We calculated CM and PM incidence using Statistics SA population denominators; Poisson regression was used to determine if trends were significant. Results We identified 11617 (8%) incident cases from 137436 tested CSF specimens. The median age of all cases was 37 years (IQR: 30- 46). CM, PM and OBM accounted for 85% (9 883), 12% (1431) and 3% (294) over the 5-year period. The overall incidence (per 100,000 persons) of CM declined by 13% from 25.7 cases in 2009 to 22.4 cases in 2013 (p<0.001) and for PM decreased by 56% from 4.4 cases in 2009 to 1.9 cases in 2013 (p ><0.001).

However, the value of routine screening of infants with this test has not been determined.Methods All infants admitted to Linkou Chang-Gung Memorial Hospital (Taoyuan, Taiwan) from January 2005 to May 2013 were screened with a urinary GBS antigen test (Wellcogen Strep B). Medical records were retrospectively reviewed to determine the diagnostic value of this test.Results A total of 14,277 infants were tested and 38 cases had confirmed diagnoses of invasive GBS disease (34 bacteremia, 18 meningitis, 14 both), corresponding to a prevalence of 0.27% among our admitted infants. A total of 106 infants had positive results, but only 26 had confirmed disease. Among infants with confirmed disease, 12 had negative antigen results. These data allowed calculation of the sensitivity (68.4%), specificity (99.4%), positive predictive value (24.5%), and negative predictive value (99.9%). Adjusting for prevalence, the disease probability of a positive test result was 23.6%, and the probability of a negative post-test result was 0.09%. The absolute risk reduction of a negative result was very small (0.18%). Analysis of demographic, clinical, and laboratory parameters indicated that late age of onset (≥7 days-old), presence of seizure, fever, respiratory distress, leukopenia, bandemia, thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, metabolic acidosis, and elevated levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) were significantly related to the presence of a true positive test result.Conclusion In our study population, the positive predictive value of the GBS antigen test was poor and the risk reduction of a negative result was weak.

Medical records were retrospectively reviewed to determine the diagnostic value of this test.Results A total of 14,277 infants were tested and 38 cases had confirmed diagnoses of invasive GBS disease (34 bacteremia, 18 meningitis, 14 both), corresponding to a prevalence of 0.27% among our admitted infants. A total of 106 infants had positive results, but only 26 had confirmed disease. Among infants with confirmed disease, 12 had negative antigen results. These data allowed calculation of the sensitivity (68.4%), specificity (99.4%), positive predictive value (24.5%), and negative predictive value (99.9%). Adjusting for prevalence, the disease probability of a positive test result was 23.6%, and the probability of a negative post-test result was 0.09%. The absolute risk reduction of a negative result was very small (0.18%). Analysis of demographic, clinical, and laboratory parameters indicated that late age of onset (≥7 days-old), presence of seizure, fever, respiratory distress, leukopenia, bandemia, thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, metabolic acidosis, and elevated levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) were significantly related to the presence of a true positive test result.Conclusion In our study population, the positive predictive value of the GBS antigen test was poor and the risk reduction of a negative result was weak. These results indicate that routine screening with this test has a limited diagnostic value. However, GBS antigen testing appears to be useful for early detection of disease in infants with certain demographic, clinical, and laboratory risk factors.",FALSE,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 226}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 226}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 226}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 226}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 226}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 226}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 226}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 226}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 226}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 226}",1

Diagnostic criteria include a persistent CD4 T cell lymphopenia with no underlying primary or secondary immunodeficiencies, with a CD4 T cell count < 300 cell/mL or a CD4 T cell count < 20% total lymphocytes on multiple occasions. Case Report: 52 year old Caucasian female, with history of SLE controlled on plaquinil, presented with a 2 month history of headaches associated with confusion, dizziness, nausea/vomiting, and right eye pain. Upon admission, an MRI revealed leptomeningeal enhancement. Cryptococcus neoformans grew on CSF culture. Amphotericin B and flucytosine were initiated. An absolute CD4 count was 86 (normal (N): >500). HIV testing with PCR, HSV, hepatitis panel, PPD, HTLV, and histoplasmosis and blastomycosis antigen tests were all negative. Immunology consult was obtained. B cell lymphocytes, NK cells, immunoglobulin levels, mitogen proliferation studies, CH50 and C2 were normal. Antibody titers for diphtheria, tetanus, and streptococcus pneumonia revealed protective levels. Based on the presentation, lab findings, and no identifiable cause for low CD4 count, the patient was diagnosed with ICL. She was discharged on amphotericin and flucytosine and prophylactic treatment with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole was initiated. The patient was medication compliant and asymptomatic at her 2 week follow-up visit. The repeat labs revealed an absolute CD4 and CD8 count of 37 and 91 (N: >200), and a CD4/CD8 ratio of 0.41. Discussion: Patients with ICL are usually identified when the CD4 count is less than 200 and complications develop. Opportunistic infections are the most common initial manifestations.

In the step-down inhibitory avoidance task, there were no differences in behavior between training and test sessions in the meningitis group, showing aversive memory impairment; conversely, differences were observed in the meningitis + EE group, demonstrating aversive memory preservation.

236,236,Protracted bacterial bronchitis,"Protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB) is a pediatric condition clinically defined as (a) the presence of isolated chronic (>4 weeks) wet cough, (b) resolution of cough with antibiotic treatment and (c) absence of pointers suggestive of an alternative specific cause of cough. While our original description® included a criteria that required findings from bronchoalveolar lavage, we adapted the definition for clinical use.2 PBB has been officially recognized in chronic cough guidelines of many countries including the USA, Australia, Britain, Belgium, and China. PBB is common among children seen in respiratory clinics. In a multicentre study in Australia involving 272 children newly referred for chronic cough, PBB was the most common (41.6%) etiology of the chronic cough.3 PBB is more common in boys and those who have attended child-care.4 Children with PBB are typically very young (median age ∼2 years) and may have parent-reported wheeze. The reported 'wheeze' may actually be a rattle (reflective of airway secretions) and not a true wheeze.5 However, children with PBB may have co-existent asthma but in a prospective cohort study, we found that median peripheral blood eosinophils, total IgE and RAST testing for common aeroallergens in children with PBB were similar to controls.4 The chest x-rays of children with PBB may be reported as 'normal' but usually show peribronchiolar changes (although in radiology studies, the reporting of peribronchial changes has poor agreement). In many children co-existent trachea-bronchomalacia6 is present although we found that no significant difference in the frequency of trachea-bronchomalacia between children with PBB and 'non-PBB controls' (children with respiratory symptoms but did not have PBB).4 Common respiratory pathogens found in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) of children with PBB are H. influenza (mostly non-typable), S. pneumoniae and M. catarrhalis. In the original description of PBB,1 children who had the classical respiratory viruses detected by PCR were excluded, so as to obtain a 'clean group'. More recently, using current definition, our prospective study showed that compared to controls, adenovirus was more likely to be detected on the BAL in those with PBB (OR 6.69, 1.50-29.80). Median CD56 and CD16 (natural killer T cells) cell levels in blood were elevated for age (0.7× 109/L, IQR 0.5-0.9) in children with PBB.4 Thus it is likely, but remains uncertain, that viruses play a role in the trigger and/or pathogenesis of PBB. Using the available clinical tests (immunoglobulin levels and responses to tetanus and H. influenza type b vaccines), the adaptive immunity in children with PBBis normal.We have examined several aspects of innate immunity in children with PBB. The bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) of children with PBB had marked airway neutrophilia and increased IL-8 and active matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9).7 Airway toll-like receptors (TLR)-2 and TLR-4 mRNA expression, as well as human b-defensin-2 and mannosebinding lectin levels were also elevated in children with PBB when compared to controls.7,8 In contrast, airway surfactant protein-A was not elevated and the ability of BAL cells to respond to various stimuli (lipopolysaccharide, lipoteichoic acid and polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid [poly(I:C)]) in-vivo were unlikely to be deficient. Children with PBB do not have an easily identifiable innate immune dysfunction but it remains unknown if those with recurrent PBB do. PBB is also characterised by increased IL-1β pathway activation in the BAL cells. IL-1β correlated with BAL neutrophilia, and the duration and severity of cough symptoms (unpublished). In PBB, the child's cough resolves only after a prolonged course (10-14 days) of appropriate antibiotics9 with resultant improved cough-specific and generic health related quality of life measures.3 Anecdotal experience suggest that when shorter courses of antibiotics are used, the cough subsides but does not resolve and/or resolves but recurs very quickly. Reasons for this are unknown but one postulate is that longer courses of antibiotics are required to overcome the bacteria associated with formation of biofilms, recently demonstrated in the BAL of children without cystic fibrosis or Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection.10 Some children with PBB have recurrent episodes (>3 per year) and some progress to chronic suppurative lung disease. Thus, children with PBB should be clinically reviewed. Predictors of recurrence are currently unknown. Further, while chronic wet cough in children often signify PBB, wet cough could also be the marker of other conditions. Recurrent episodes of PBB and/or wet cough not resolving to simple therapies should prompt further evaluations of other causes of chronic wet cough (such as aspiration) as while most children with chronic wet cough have an airway infection, not all children do. The importance of wet cough in children relate to the implications of persistent endobronchial infection with the associated neutrophilic inflammation and the relationship with suppurative lung disease. In a retrospective case series, we found that children who did not respond to a 4-week course of antibiotics were significantly more likely to have radiologically confirmed bronchiectasis, compared to those whose cough resolved (adjusted odds ratio 20.9; 95%CI 5.36-81.8).11 It is likely that PBB lies in a spectrum with radiological bronchiectasis at the other end of the spectrum, where on-going untreated infection and inflammation may cause irreversible airway and lung destruction in some people.",FALSE,"Protracted bacterial bronchitisProtracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB) is a pediatric condition clinically defined as (a) the presence of isolated chronic (>4 weeks) wet cough, (b) resolution of cough with antibiotic treatment and (c) absence of pointers suggestive of an alternative specific cause of cough.

Surveillance systems are necessary to monitor the burden of pneumococcal disease, especially in the setting of pneumococcal vaccination programs. Aim of this study is to evaluate the serotype distribution and antimicrobial suscestibility of Streptocccus pneumoniae causing invasive pneumococcal disease in adults (>18) during the time period before the 13-valent conjugated pneumococcal vaccine introduce in Turkey. Methods & Materials: Streptocccus pneumoniae strains were collected from 8 different centre between 2005 and 2011. All collected strains were frozen and kept at -80 C, in glycerol before used. Strains were identified by screening for alpha hemolysis, optochin susceptibility, sodium deoxycholate lysis, and latex tests to detect S. pneumoniae antigen. S.pneumoniae strains were studied for penicillin, cefotaxime, erythromycin and moxifloxacin susceptibilities by E-test (AB Biodisk, Sweden). Results were evaluated according to the CLSI standards and the strains isolated from CSF from others were seperated, for the interpretation of penicilin and cefotaxime. Serogrouping was performed with the latex particle agglutination and serotyping was made with the conventional Quellung reaction using commercial type-spesific antisera. Results: In this study, 176 Streptococcus pneumoniae clinical isolates were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility and serotyping. These isolates were sampled from: blood cultures(n:109); cerebrospinal fluid(n:26); bronchoalveolar lavage(n:21) and the other sterile body fluids(n:20).

243,243,Bloodstream infections among children living in rural settings in Uganda and predictors of mortality outcome,"Background: Bloodstream infections are acommon cause of admission, morbidity and mortality among children. The impact of antibiotic resistance and HIV infection on treatment outcome and survailance is not known in many rural african settings. Methods & Materials: We assessed the incidence of bloodstreem infection and risk factors for death in prospective study from 4 rural settings in central Uganda. There were observed 953 consecutive admissions at pediatric word of children with signs of infectious systemic disease. Bloodwaobtained for serological test - HIV antibody test, culture and malaria microscopy, when indicated. There were recorded data on clinical findings, underlying diseases, antimictobial drug used before and on admission, microbial agent findings and outcome. Results: The incidence of laboratory confirmed bloodstreem infection was 18,6% from admitted children with systemic infectious sings. More than 72% of the patients received prior admission at least one course of antimicrobial therapy and 55% antimarial therapy, prior a blood culture. The most frequent isolates were Klebsiella spp., E. coli, Salmonella, enterococci, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus spp. 34% of the pediatric patients had a malaria, 8% HIV infection and 2,5% Tubercuosis. 2% had viral meningitis and 3,3% bacterial infection, confirmed by CSF examination. 37,8% of the chiildren with laboratory confirmed bloodstream infection died. 57% of the microbial agents had confirmed resistance at least to one common antibiotic.

Herein we present an unusual case of FUO with several confounding historical elements that detracted from the ultimate diagnosis of giant cell arteritis (GCA). A 50 year-old Guatemalan male with a history of sinusitis presented to our hospital approximately 4 months after the onset of daily fevers as well as upper and lower extremity myalgias. Approximately 5 months prior to his hospitalization, his travels included a hiking trip in Minnesota and a spelunking (caving) expedition in Kentucky. Three weeks after returning to Guatemala, he developed the aforementioned myalgias and fevers. Despite his myalgias resolving and an extensive infectious disease workup done in Guatemala (the patient received multiple antibiotics for treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection, a helminthic infection, prolonged sinusitis, and a typhoid infection), his fevers persisted. Due to his travel history, an infectious etiology was initially again pursued. Initial lab abnormalities included an elevated WBC to 14.2 and platelets to 744. ESR and CRP levels were elevated to 105 and 294, respectively. His infectious workup was negative including HIV, PPD, peripheral blood smear for malaria, and tests for brucella, Histoplasmosis, rickettsia, Strongyloides, Lyme disease, acute hepatitis, coccidioidomycosis, syphilis, and cryptococcus. A CT revealed rectal wall thickening and non-specific pulmonary nodules without evidence of malignancy. A flexible sigmoidoscopy and colonoscopy were unremarkable. Blood cultures revealed 1 out of 4 bottles positive for Streptococcus parasanguinis with sterile urine cultures. Repeat blood cultures remained negative and both TTE and TEE were unrevealing for vegetations. He was subsequently treated for his presumed Streptococcal bacteremia. During hospitalization, the patient developed vertical diplopia with decreased vision of the right eye. Ophthalmologic examination revealed boxcarring and a rheumatological workup was then pursued with specific concern for vasculitis. Further questioning revealed 3 episodes of blurry vision and diplopia in the previous 3 months that spontaneously resolved within 30 min. No abnormalities to the temporal artery were felt on examination and the patient never complained of headache. Myeloperoxidase (MPO) antibodies returned positive as well as rheumatoid factor and SS-B. SS-A, ANA, Anti-citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibodies were also unremarkable. Although an MRI/MRA of his head did not show evidence of vasculitis, the presumed diagnosis of GCA versus ANCA associated vasculitis was given and he was initiated on pulse dose steroids followed by transition to oral steroids. A subsequent biopsy of his temporal artery was consistent with GCA and he was appropriately treated. DISCUSSION: Low grade bacteremia without septicemia has been documented in otherwise healthy patients following oral manipulation. Since the patient had no symptoms of septicemia or infective endocarditis, an infectious etiology to his FUO was excluded despite having S. parasanguinis in one of four bottles. Given that subsequent blood cultures were negative, contamination was suspected. Workup for malignancy with imaging was also unremarkable, leaving a rheumatologic diagnosis as the most likely cause of his FUO. Previous studies on FUO have suggested that up to 22 % of FUO cases end up with rheumatologic diagnoses compared to only 16 % attributed to infectious causes. This patient's FUO was ultimately associated with his diagnosis of GCA after meeting 3 of the 5 criteria for diagnosis (age > or = 50 years, ESR>50 mm/h, and biopsy consistent with the diagnosis). GCA accounts for approximately 2 % of all cases of FUO, although rarely do patients not present with headache or visual symptoms. Despite his rheumatological work up revealing a positive SS-B and RF, the patient did not meet criteria for Sjogren's syndrome or rheumatoid arthritis, two other known causes of FUO. This interesting case presenting with an otherwise unrelated travel history highlights the diagnostic dilemma when faced with multiple positive results and confounding factors. A detailed history to elicit specific details the patient might not associate with his present illness is appropriate in such cases.

Methods: A total of 279 pediatric patients with a variety of infections and 58 normal controls were enrolled in this study. Serum ApoE levels were detected using an immunoturbidimetric assay. A mouse sepsis model was established to evaluate the expression of ApoE and its receptors by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blotting. Results: Serum ApoE was markedly increased in cases with bacterial infections including sepsis, bacterial meningitis, and bacterial pneumonia, compared to healthy controls. No significantly elevated serum ApoE levels were observed in aseptic meningitis patients or mycoplasma pneumonia patients. The mice sepsis models showed a similar pattern of increased serum ApoE levels in the early stage of infections. We found reduced expression of ApoE and its receptors in the liver tissues in these mice models. Conclusion: Serum ApoE may represent a novel indicator for diagnosis of bacterial infections, especially sepsis, in pediatric patients.

247,247,The relationship between concentration of specific antibody at birth and subsequent response to primary immunization,"Background and aims: Trans-placentally acquired antibodies can protect infants from infection in the first months of life. However, high concentrations of antibody at birth may impact the infant's own immune response to primary immunization. We examine the relationship between concentration of specific antibody to Bordetella pertussis, Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), tetanus toxoid and pneumococcal antigens at birth and following primary immunization. Methods: Healthy mother-infant pairs were recruited from a UK maternity unit. Peripheral blood samples were obtained at birth and 4 weeks after primary immunization. Specific antibody concentrations were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Pertussis antibody concentrations >50. IU/ml, Tetanus antibody levels >0.1. IU/ml and Hib antibody levels >0.15. mg/l were regarded as protective. Results: Following primary immunization, 35/36 (97%) infants had specific antibody concentrations associated with protection against Hib, 32/36 (89%) against pertussis and 36/36 (100%) against tetanus. Concentrations of all specific antibodies were significantly higher than at birth (p<0.0001), except anti-tetanus toxoid, p=0.41. However, there was an inverse correlation between infant antibody concentration at birth and fold-increase in antibody concentration post-immunization for tetanus: rs -0.86 (95%CI -0.93 to -0.74), p<0.0001; pneumococcus: rs -0.82 (95% CI -0.91 to -0.67), p<0.0001; pertussis: rs -0.77 (95% CI -0.89 to -0.58), p<0.0001 and Hib: rs -0.66 (95%CI -0.82 to -0.42), p<0.0001.

Conclusion: Higher antibody concentration at birth appeared to inhibit the response to infant immunization for tetanus and pneumococcus; the effect was less marked for Hib and pertussis.

249,249,Evaluation of chromID strepto B as a screening media for Streptococcus agalactiae,"Background: Streptococcus agalactiae (Group B Streptococcus, GBS), a leading cause of sepsis and meningitis in infants, can be transmitted vertically from mother to infant during passage through the birth canal. Detection of GBS colonization in perinatal women is a major strategy for the prevention of postpartum neonatal disease. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that all women undergo vaginal-rectal screening for GBS colonization at 35-37 weeks of gestation. ChromID Strepto B (STRB) is a chromogenic GBS screening media on which GBS colonies appear pink or red, while other bacteria are either inhibited or form colonies in other colors. In this study, we compared STRB with a conventional GBS detection method using 5% sheep blood agar (BA) followed by a selective enrichment broth.Methods: Anovaginal swabs were collected from 1425 women during weeks 35 to 37 of their pregnancies. The swabs were used to inoculate both STRB and BA plates after enrichment with selective Todd Hewitt Broth (THB). A GBS latex agglutination test was used to confirm the identity of isolates from each plate.Results: GBS was recovered from 319 (22.4%) samples with one or both media: 318 on STRB compared to 299 using BA. One false negative was observed on STRB, and 20 false negatives were observed on BA. In addition, non-hemolytic GBS was recovered from 19 (6.0%) samples using STRB.Conclusions: STRB offers effectiveness and convenience over BA for GBS screening in clinical laboratories. STRB produces fewer false negatives, has a higher detection rate and uses a simple color screen that is ideal for technician-level applications.

We reviewed a cohort of patients at Duke University Medical Center (DUMC) who received immunization with bacteriophage and report the clinical utility and safety of the immunization, as well as patient characteristics. Methods: A retrospective chart review was performed of all Duke Immunology Clinic patients (pediatric and adult) who received immunizations with bacteriophage, from 1976-2012. Subjects were selected for inclusion if their diagnosis at the time of bacteriophage was either presumed or confirmed common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), hypogammaglobulinemia, transient hypogammaglobulinemia, or antibody deficiency unspecified. Follow up post-immunization was also recorded. Results: One hundred twenty-six patients were identified, 36 adult and 90 pediatric patients. Diagnoses prior to bacteriophage were CVID (n=100), hypogammaglobulinemia (n=23), and antibody deficiency (n=3). Post-immunization diagnoses were CVID (n=65), hypogammaglobulinemia (n=19), unknown (n=23), no primary immune deficiency (n=10), and other primary immunodeficiency (n=9). Seventy-five patients had abnormal bacteriophage results, 37 were normal, and 14 were borderline. There were 257 recorded administrations of the immunization. Information was available on adverse reactions for 171 administrations. Fourteen immunizations were associated with minor adverse events.

Studies included in this analysis evaluated = 2 primary doses of PCV before 6 months of age in non-high-risk populations, used 7-valent or higher PCV products (excluding Aventis-Pasteur and Merck products) and provided information on geometric mean concentration (GMC) for STs 1, 5, 6B, 14, 19F or 23F. Using random effects meta-regression, we assessed the impact of geographic region, coadministered vaccines and PCV product on postprimary GMC, adjusting for dosing schedule and ELISA laboratory method. Results: Of 12,980 citations reviewed, we identified 103 vaccine study arms for this analysis. Children in studies from Asia, Africa and Latin America had significantly higher GMC responses compared with those in studies from Europe and North America. Coadministration with acellular pertussis DTP compared with whole-cell DTP had no effect on PCV immunogenicity except for ST14, where GMCs were higher when coadministered with acellular pertussis DTP. Vaccine product, number of PCV doses, dosing interval, age at first dose and ELISA laboratory method also affected the GMC. Conclusions: PCV immunogenicity is associated with geographic region and vaccine product; however, the associations and magnitude varied by ST. Consideration of these factors is essential when comparing PCV immunogenicity results between groups and should be included in the evidence base when selecting optimal PCV vaccine schedules in specific settings.

It is a rare disease with a prevalence of CVID is approximately 1: 50,000-200,000. Clinical manifestations of CVID include recurrent bacterial infections, autoimmune, gastrointestinal, lymphoproliferative, granulomatous, and malignancy. Case Report: Twenty-two year-old Hispanic female presented with a throbbing headache, nuchal rigidity, photophobia and a high grade fever. Lumbar puncture with CSF assessment revealed a turbid fluid with WBC of 6937 per uL, poly-morphnuclear cells of 81%, protein 248 mg/dL, glucose <3 mg/Dl. CSF antigens were positive for Streptococcus pneumonia and CSF culture grew pansensitive Strepococcus pneumonia. Immunoglobin (Ig) levels of IgA, IgE, IgG and IgM were all decreased. Absolute cell counts of CD3, CD4 and CD8 were all low. Bone marrow biopsy was normocellular. Excisional lymph node biopsy revealed lymph nodes with reactive follicular hyperplasia. Common variable immunodeficiency disease (CVID) was diagnosed based on exclusion. IVIG therapy was given and patient received a two-week course of ceftriaxone. Conclusions: The diagnosis of CVID is made based on the following criteria: 1) Marked decrease of IgG and at least one of the IgM or IgA isotypes. 2) The onset of immunodeficiency at greater than 2 years old. 3) Absence of isohem-agglutinins and/or poor response to vaccines 4) Exclusion of other defined causes of hypogammaglobulinemia.

264,264,Risk factors and clinical significance of invasive infections caused by levofloxacin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae,"Purpose: Fluoroquinolones are recommended for the treatment of pneumonia. The recognition of risk factors for invasive levofloxacin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae is important for the design of treatment. Methods: A retrospective review of cases of invasive pneumococcal infections in adults was undertaken. Epidemiologic data, predisposing factors, clinical variables, and outcome were recorded from previously established protocols. Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by disk diffusion and the Etest method. Serotyping was performed by latex agglutination and Quellung reaction. Results: Twenty patients with infection caused by levofloxacin-resistant pneumococci [minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) ≥2 μg/ml] were compared with 102 patients harboring levofloxacin-susceptible strains; 80 % of levofloxacin-resistant pneumococci were resistant to ≥3 antibiotics but susceptible to penicillin. Most levofloxacin-resistant strains (80 %) belonged to serotype 8. In comparison, only 8 % of levofloxacin-susceptible pneumococci belonged to serotype 8. In the multivariate analysis, residence in public shelters [odds ratio (OR) 26.13; p 0.002], previous hospitalization (OR 61.77; p < 0.001), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (OR 28.14; p = 0.009), and heavy smoking (OR 14.41; p = 0.016) were associated with an increased risk of infection by levofloxacin-resistant pneumococci. Mortality caused by levofloxacin-resistant and levofloxacin-susceptible pneumococci was 35 and 14 %, respectively. Among HIV-positive individuals infected with levofloxacin- resistant pneumococci 44 % died, but only 12.5 % of HIV-positive patients with levofloxacin-susceptible strains died. Conclusions: We observed the emergence of serotype 8 as the main cause of invasive disease caused by levofloxacin- resistant S. pneumoniae.

265,265,Early B cell reconstitution after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is associated with a distinctive innate-like immune response,"B cell dysfunction following delayed immune reconstitution substantially contributes to an increased risk for life-threatening infections after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT). In this study, we phenotypically and functionally investigated B cell subset reconstitution kinetics and kappa-deleting recombination excision circles (KREC), which are non-replicative episomal plasmids generated during bone marrow B cell development, in adult patients diagnosed with acute leukemia after alloHSCT. Additionally, specific B cell antibody responses were analysed by Elispot assay after ex vivo stimulation including CpG. Early onset of bone marrow neogenesis was seen in 52% of patients, characterized by a strong increase of transitional B cells between day 60 and 90 post alloHSCT. KREC quantification by RT-PCR revealed a highly positive and significant correlation between absolute KREC copy numbers and transitional B cells (Spearman: r = 1.00, p = 0.003) indicating ongoing B cell neogenesis in patients with an early recovering B cell reconstitution. Within the next months, patients with early B cell reconstitution also exhibited significantly stronger increases of naïve and IgM memory B cells compared to delayed B cell reconstituting patients, whereas switched memory B cells were lacking in all patients. Interestingly, early reconstituting B cells were paralleled by higher levels of IgM producing B cells against capsular pneumococcal polysaccharide after ex vivo stimulation at day 180 post alloHSCT, whereas polyclonal IgG and Tetanus-specific IgG producing B cells were significantly diminished in all patients. From our data we conclude, that early onset of B cell reconstitution in alloHSCT patients is characterized by an increase of newly regenerated transitional B cells within three months after transplantation. Hereby, KREC quantification is a suitable marker for monitoring of B cell-bone marrow output. Furthermore, IgM B cell responses against Streptococcus pneumonia resulted most likely from the significantly higher levels of reconstituted IgM memory B cells, since naïve B cells were shown not to generate antibody-secreting cells upon CpG stimulation (Capolunghi F et al. 2008) and switched memory B cells were lacking.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the optimal primary vaccination schedule by comparing immunogenicity of 13-valent PCV (PCV13) in 4 different immunization schedules. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: An open-label, parallel-group, randomized clinical trial of healthy term infants in a general community in the Netherlands conducted between June 30, 2010, and January 25, 2011, with 99% follow-up until age 12 months. INTERVENTIONS: Infants (N = 400) were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) to receive PCV13 either at ages 2, 4, and 6 months (2-4-6); at ages 3 and 5 months (3-5); at ages 2, 3, and 4 months (2-3-4); or at ages 2 and 4 months (2-4), with a booster dose at age 11.5 months. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary outcome measure was antibody geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) against PCV13-included serotypes 1 month after the booster dose measured by multiplex immunoassay. Secondary outcomes included GMCs measured 1 month after the primary series, at 8 months of age, and before the booster. RESULTS: The primary outcome, GMCs at 1 month after the booster dose, was not significantly different between schedules for 70 of 78 comparisons. The 2-4-6 schedule was superior to the 2-3-4 schedule for serotypes 18C (10.2 μg/mL [95% CI, 8.2-12.7] vs 6.5 μg/mL [95% CI, 5.4-7.8]) and 23F (10.9 μg/mL [95% CI, 9.0-13.3] vs 7.3 μg/mL [95% CI, 5.8-9.2]) and superior to the 2-4 schedule for serotypes 6B (8.5 μg/mL [95% CI, 7.1-10.2] vs 5.1 μg/mL [95% CI 3.8-6.7]), 18C (6.6 μg/mL [95% CI, 5.7-7.7]), and 23F (7.2 μg/mL [95% CI, 5.9-8.8]). For serotype 1, the 3-5 schedule (11.7 μg/mL [95% CI, 9.6-14.3]) was superior to the other schedules. Geometric mean concentrations for all 13 serotypes ranged between 1.6 and 19.9 μg/mL. Secondary outcomes demonstrated differences 1 month after the primary series. The 2-4-6 schedule was superior compared with the 3-5, 2-3-4, and 2-4 schedules for 3, 9, and 11 serotypes, respectively. Differences between schedules persisted until the booster dose. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The use of 4 different PCV13 immunization schedules in healthy term infants resulted in no statistically significant differences in antibody levels after the booster dose for almost all serotypes.

270,270,Group B streptococcal bacteremia in a major teaching hospital in Malaysia: A case series of eighteen patients,"Background: Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is a leading cause of infections such as meningitis and septicemia in neonates and pregnant women; however the significance of invasive GBS disease has not been clearly defined in non-pregnant adults. Methods: We reviewed the hospital records of 18 cases with GBS bacteremia who attended the Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia Medical Centre from June 2010 to October 2011. We analyzed the clinical findings of both bacteremic adults and neonates and compared them to previous studies of GBS bacteremia. Serotyping was done by latex agglutination test using 10 distinct antisera (Ia, Ib, and II-IX). Results: During the period of 1 year and 4 months, there were 18 patients with GBS bacteremia. Five cases occurred in neonates, one in a parturient woman, and 12 in other adults. All neonates with bacteremia were males and two of them were premature. Septicemia was the most common clinical presentation in neonates. They were treated with intravenous (IV) penicillin G and gentamicin. The adults included nine men (69%) and four women (31%). Their mean age was 60 years and all patients had more than two underlying conditions. The most common clinical syndrome was pneumonia (n=6, 46.5%).

Methods: We reviewed the hospital records of 18 cases with GBS bacteremia who attended the Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia Medical Centre from June 2010 to October 2011. We analyzed the clinical findings of both bacteremic adults and neonates and compared them to previous studies of GBS bacteremia. Serotyping was done by latex agglutination test using 10 distinct antisera (Ia, Ib, and II-IX). Results: During the period of 1 year and 4 months, there were 18 patients with GBS bacteremia. Five cases occurred in neonates, one in a parturient woman, and 12 in other adults. All neonates with bacteremia were males and two of them were premature. Septicemia was the most common clinical presentation in neonates. They were treated with intravenous (IV) penicillin G and gentamicin. The adults included nine men (69%) and four women (31%). Their mean age was 60 years and all patients had more than two underlying conditions. The most common clinical syndrome was pneumonia (n=6, 46.5%).

ABM must be differentiated from systemic disorders with CNS manifestations that may mimic ABM. ABM should also be differentiated from acute meningoencephalitis (AME) and acute viral encephalitis (AVE). Nonviral causes of AME are treatable. Among the causes of AVE, Herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE) is treatable. This article reviews the clinical diagnostic approach to ABM, AME and AVE. Areas covered: The differential diagnostic (DDx) approach to ABM, AME and AVE is based on clinical and laboratory findings. A specific pathogen diagnosis is based on serum/cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tests. This overview presents the diagnostic approach to ABM, AME and AVE in normal hosts (excluding brain abscesses and chronic CNS infections). Expert opinion: It is time critical to diagnose ABM and begin empiric antimicrobial therapy based on the known/most likely pathogen. The diagnosis of ABM depends on clinical features and the CSF profile. The CSF Gram stain and CSF lactic acid (LA) levels provide the most rapid, reliable and cost-effective tests to diagnose ABM.

We assessed the impact of introduction of Hib conjugate vaccine into the Expanded Program on Immunization in Bangladesh on purulent and laboratory-confirmed H influenzae meningitis. Study design: Within a well-defined catchment area around 2 surveillance hospitals in Dhaka, Bangladesh, we compared the incidence of Hib meningitis confirmed by culture, latex agglutination, and polymerase chain reaction assay among infants 1 year before and 1 year after introduction of Hib conjugate vaccine. We adjusted the incidence rate for the proportion of children who sought care at the surveillance hospitals. Results: Among infants, the incidence of confirmed Hib meningitis decreased from 92-16 cases per 100 000 within 1 year of vaccine introduction (vaccine preventable incidence = 76; 95% CI 18, 135 per 100 000).

In 2010, both 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine and meningococcal capsular group C conjugate vaccine were introduced into the routine vaccination schedule. Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine was previously introduced in 1999. This study presents trends in demographics, microbiological characteristics and seasonality patterns of bacterial meningitis cases in Brazil from 2000 to 2010.Methods and Findings:All meningitis cases confirmed by clinical and/or laboratory criteria notified to the national information system for notifiable diseases between 2000 and 2010 were analyzed. Proportions of bacterial meningitis cases by demographic characteristics, criteria used for confirmation and etiology were calculated. We estimated disease rates per 100,000 population and trends for the study period, with emphasis on H. influenzae, N. meningitidis and S. pneumoniae cases. In the decade, 341,805 cases of meningitis were notified in Brazil. Of the 251,853 cases with defined etiology, 110,264 (43.8%) were due to bacterial meningitis (excluding tuberculosis).

277,277,Lung mass and pleural effusion-planning for a biopsy? Let us test the urine before that!,"LEARNING OBJECTIVE 1: Recognize that urine antigen testing has high sensitivity and acceptable specificity to diagnose blastomycosis. LEARNING OBJECTIVE 2: Recognize that blastomycosis can present with large pleural effusion. CASE: A 30 years old female presented with non-productive cough, shortness of breath on exertion, left-sided pleuritic chest pain, and an episode of hemoptysis progressively worsening for 14 days. About 10 days prior to admission, she presented to the ER with fever, non-productive cough and left-sided pleuritic chest pain. Her chest X-ray then, showed a rounded opacity in the left parahilar region and a small left pleural effusion. A CT of chest then, showed a 5.4×3.3 cm pleural-based consolidation or mass along the anterior aspect of the left upper lobe at the level of the left hilum and scattered smaller nodular opacities in the left upper lobe. She was discharged with levofloxacin, but she did not improve. Her past medical history included asthma. She emigrated from Guyana 15 years back. She had never smoked. She was a nurse. She had no family history of cancer, connective tissue disease or immunologic disease. Her vitals were stable. Her physical exam revealed decreased breath sounds in the left middle and lower lung fields. Her CXR showed a large left side pleural effusion. Thoracentesis yielded 1500 ml of clear yellow fluid. Pleural fluid analysis: LDH-127 IU/L, Glucose-103 mg/dL, protein-5.3 g/dL and WBCs-100 cu mm. Pleural fluid analysis was consistent with an exudate. Quantiferon TB gold, urine legionella and streptococcus antigens were negative. Blood culture, pleural fluid gram stain, AFB stain, KOH preparation and culture were negative. A CT-guided biopsy of the lung mass was contemplated. But, before obtaining the biopsy, urine was tested for blastomyces antigen and it was positive. The patient was treated with itraconazole. She improved clinically and a follow-up CXR in 6 weeks showed complete resolution of the mass. DISCUSSION: Blastomycosis is a systemic pyogranulomatous infection that arises after inhalation of the conidia of the fungus, Blastomyces dermatitidis. Although it can involve any organ, lung is the most common site of infection. Pulmonary blastomycosis can cause alveolar infiltrates, fibronodular opacities and mass lesions. Although small pleural effusions are frequent, large pleural effusions are uncommon. Our patient is unique that she had a large pleural effusion. Due to the variability of the presentation and its rarity, it is important to maintain a high index of suspicion in patients with non-resolving pneumonia. Definitive diagnosis requires growth of the organism from a clinical specimen, but urine antigen detection has a sensitivity of 90 % and a specificity of 80 % and has proven useful. Urine antigen levels can be used to monitor the response to treatment. Urine antigen detection should be done before biopsy in all suspected cases, as it can preclude the need for biopsy and therefore the risk of complication, discomfort and expense associated with an invasive investigation.",FALSE,"Lung mass and pleural effusion-planning for a biopsy?

CASE: A 30 years old female presented with non-productive cough, shortness of breath on exertion, left-sided pleuritic chest pain, and an episode of hemoptysis progressively worsening for 14 days. About 10 days prior to admission, she presented to the ER with fever, non-productive cough and left-sided pleuritic chest pain. Her chest X-ray then, showed a rounded opacity in the left parahilar region and a small left pleural effusion. A CT of chest then, showed a 5.4×3.3 cm pleural-based consolidation or mass along the anterior aspect of the left upper lobe at the level of the left hilum and scattered smaller nodular opacities in the left upper lobe. She was discharged with levofloxacin, but she did not improve. Her past medical history included asthma. She emigrated from Guyana 15 years back. She had never smoked. She was a nurse. She had no family history of cancer, connective tissue disease or immunologic disease. Her vitals were stable. Her physical exam revealed decreased breath sounds in the left middle and lower lung fields. Her CXR showed a large left side pleural effusion. Thoracentesis yielded 1500 ml of clear yellow fluid. Pleural fluid analysis: LDH-127 IU/L, Glucose-103 mg/dL, protein-5.3 g/dL and WBCs-100 cu mm. Pleural fluid analysis was consistent with an exudate. Quantiferon TB gold, urine legionella and streptococcus antigens were negative. Blood culture, pleural fluid gram stain, AFB stain, KOH preparation and culture were negative. A CT-guided biopsy of the lung mass was contemplated. But, before obtaining the biopsy, urine was tested for blastomyces antigen and it was positive. The patient was treated with itraconazole. She improved clinically and a follow-up CXR in 6 weeks showed complete resolution of the mass. DISCUSSION: Blastomycosis is a systemic pyogranulomatous infection that arises after inhalation of the conidia of the fungus, Blastomyces dermatitidis. Although it can involve any organ, lung is the most common site of infection. Pulmonary blastomycosis can cause alveolar infiltrates, fibronodular opacities and mass lesions. Although small pleural effusions are frequent, large pleural effusions are uncommon. Our patient is unique that she had a large pleural effusion. Due to the variability of the presentation and its rarity, it is important to maintain a high index of suspicion in patients with non-resolving pneumonia. Definitive diagnosis requires growth of the organism from a clinical specimen, but urine antigen detection has a sensitivity of 90 % and a specificity of 80 % and has proven useful. Urine antigen levels can be used to monitor the response to treatment. Urine antigen detection should be done before biopsy in all suspected cases, as it can preclude the need for biopsy and therefore the risk of complication, discomfort and expense associated with an invasive investigation.",FALSE,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 277}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 277}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 277}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 277}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 277}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 277}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 277}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 277}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 277}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 277}",1

279,279,Controlling serogroup B invasive meningococcal disease: The Canadian perspective,"With publically funded meningococcal immunization programs established in infants, children and adolescents, Canada is at the forefront of invasive meningococcal disease prevention. The advent of two new serogroup B vaccines that may protect against multiple disease-causing strains offers the potential to reduce endemic disease to very low levels in Canada. Canada likely will be one of the first countries with approval to use recombinant serogroup B vaccine. However, inclusion of these new vaccines into public immunization programs will be decided at the provincial/territorial level, rather than nationally, and may result initially in different immunization schedules throughout the country as we have seen with conjugate meningococcal vaccines. Such heterogeneous use and adoption of new vaccines complicates disease control, but may assist in evaluation of effectiveness. Minimally, it requires regionally specific information.

We assessed whether PCV13 interferes with immune responses to concomitantly administered routine pediatric vaccines. Methods: Healthy US infants were randomly assigned in 2 studies to receive PCV13 or 7-valent PCV (PCV7) at age 2, 4 and 6 months concomitantly with diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis, inactivated polio virus, hepatitis B and Haemophilus influenzae type b, and at age 12-15 months with measles, mumps, rubella, varicella and hepatitus A. Antibodies to pertussis antigens, diphtheria, tetanus toxoid, poliovirus types 1-3, Haemophilus influenzae type b polyribosylribitol phosphate capsular polysaccharide and polyribosylribitol phosphate capsular polysaccharide were measured 1 month after the infant series; measles, mumps, rubella, varicella and polyribosylribitol phosphate capsular polysaccharide were determined 1 month after the toddler dose. Both the percentages of responders (subjects reaching a prespecified antibody concentration) and immunoglobulin G antibody geometric mean concentrations/titers were calculated for each concomitant vaccine antigen. Results: Not all assays were performed on all subjects. Data were available from 153 to 239 infants and 163-230 toddlers in the PCV13 group and 173-240 infants and 167-214 toddlers in the PCV7 group. One month after both infant series and the toddler dose, noninferiority criteria were met for all antigens with respect to percentage of responders in both PCV7 and PCV13 groups. Immunoglobulin G antibody geometric mean concentration/titer ratios (PCV13/PCV7) were 0.91-1.33 and 0.83-1.03 at 1 month after the infant series and toddler dose, respectively, and met predetermined noninferiority criteria.

Methods: We searched the medical records of 1,577 patients admitted to Tohoku University Hospital in the Sendai area within 1 month (March 11, 2011-April 11, 2011) after the disaster. We examined (1) changes in the rates of hospitalizations for infectious diseases over time and (2) the variety of infectious diseases. Results: The number of hospitalized patients with infectious diseases increased after the fi rst week to double that during the same period in 2010. Pneumonia comprised 43% of cases, and 12% consisted of skin and subcutaneous tissue infection, including tetanus. Pneumonia was prevalent in elderly patients (median age, 78 years) with low levels of serum albumin and comorbid conditions, including brain and nervous system disorders.

283,283,Fatal community-acquired pneumonia: 18 years in a medical center,"Background: Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) remains a significant cause of childhood morbidity worldwide. We analyzed the etiologies and the clinical characteristics of children who died from CAP. This study aimed at early identification of the poor prognostic factors in order to improve the efficiency of pneumonia management and prevent deaths. Methods: A retrospective chart review was performed for children younger than 18 years admitted to Shin Kong Wu Ho-Su Memorial Hospital between September 1992 and August 2010 with a diagnosis of pneumonia on admission. Twenty-one patients who died with the diagnosis of pneumonia and its complications were included in the study, along with 63 age- and year-matched survival controls. Results: Twelve patients (57.1%) were younger than 2 years. Gram-negative bacteria (7 patients) were the most frequently identified pathogen, followed by Mycoplasma pneumoniae (6 patients). Four of these six M. pneumoniae infected patients were co-infected with other pathogens. Among the clinical characteristics, fatal CAP was associated mainly with initial presentations of anemia, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, bandemia, hyponatremia, sepsis, meningitis, metabolic acidosis, disseminated intravenous coagulopathy, and underlying congenital diseases. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, metabolic acidosis (odds ratio = 8.50; 95% confidence interval = 2.82-25.60; p < 0.001) was a prognostic risk factor for fatality. Conclusion: For patients with CAP, blood gas should be included in the routine blood test on admission. Once the initial blood test associated with the aforementioned poor prognostic factors has been identified, an immediate treatment including Gram-negative bacilli antibiotics should be started aggressively in order to prevent deaths.

GBS isolates are routinely clustered in serotypes and in genotypes. At present one GBS sequence type (i.e. ST17) is considered to be closely associated with bacterial invasiveness and novel proteomic biomarkers could make a valuable contribution to currently available GBS typing data. For that purpose we analyzed the protein profiles of 170 genotyped GBS isolates by Surface-Enhanced Laser Desorption/Ionization Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (SELDI). Univariate statistical analysis of the SELDI profiles identified four protein biomarkers significantly discriminating ST17 isolates from those of the other sequence types. Two of these biomarkers (MW of 7878 Da and 12200 Da) were overexpressed and the other two (MW of 6258 Da and 10463 Da) were underexpressed in ST17. The four proteins were isolated by mass spectrometry-assisted purification and their tryptic peptides analyzed by LC-MS/MS. They were thereby identified as the small subunit of exodeoxyribonuclease VII, the 50S ribosomal protein L7/L12, a CsbD-like protein and thioredoxin, respectively.

287,287,Maternal supplementation with LGG reduces vaccine-specific immune responses in infants at high-risk of developing allergic disease,"Probiotics are defined as live micro-organisms that when administered in adequate amounts confer a health benefit on the host. Among their pleiotropic effects, inhibition of pathogen colonization at the mucosal surface as well as modulation of immune responses are widely recognized as the principal biological activities of probiotic bacteria. In recent times, the immune effects of probiotics have led to their application as vaccine adjuvants, offering a novel strategy for enhancing the efficacy of current vaccines. Such an approach is particularly relevant in regions where infectious disease burden is greatest and where access to complete vaccination programs is limited. In this study, we report the effects of the probiotic, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) on immune responses to tetanus, Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) and pneumococcal conjugate (PCV7) vaccines in infants. This study was conducted as part of a larger clinical trial assessing the impact of maternal LGG supplementation in preventing the development of atopic eczema in infants at high-risk for developing allergic disease. Maternal LGG supplementation was associated with reduced antibody responses against tetanus, Hib, and pneumococcal serotypes contained in PCV7 (N = 31) compared to placebo treatment (N = 30) but not total IgG levels. Maternal LGG supplementation was also associated with a trend to increased number of tetanus toxoid-specific T regulatory in the peripheral blood compared to placebo-treated infants. These findings suggest that maternal LGG supplementation may not be beneficial in terms of improving vaccine-specific immunity in infants. Further clinical studies are needed to confirm these findings. As probiotic immune effects can be species/strain specific, our findings do not exclude the potential use of other probiotic bacteria to modulate infant immune responses to vaccines. © 2013 Licciardi, Ismail, Balloch, Mui, Hoe, Lamb and Tang.",FALSE,"Maternal supplementation with LGG reduces vaccine-specific immune responses in infants at high-risk of developing allergic diseaseProbiotics are defined as live micro-organisms that when administered in adequate amounts confer a health benefit on the host.

293,293,"A phase 3, randomized, double-blind trial comparing the safety and immunogenicity of the 7-valent and 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccines, given with routine pediatric vaccinations, in healthy infants in Brazil","Background: The inclusion of 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) into national immunization programs in many countries has significantly decreased the incidence of disease caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae. However, a substantial portion of disease remained and, in some areas, there has been an increase in disease produced by serotypes not included in PCV7. A 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) was studied in healthy Brazilian infants in a phase 3, double-blind, randomized study. Methods: Infants were randomized to receive either PCV7 or PCV13 at 2, 4, 6, (doses 1-3), and 12 (toddler dose) months of age, along with routine pediatric vaccinations (diphtheria, tetanus, whole-cell pertussis, and Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine). Pneumococcal anticapsular polysaccharide-binding immunoglobulin G (IgG) responses and antibody responses to pertussis antigens were measured 1 month after both dose 3 of the infant series and the toddler dose. Safety and tolerability were also assessed. Results: The proportion of subjects achieving a serotype-specific IgG concentration ≥0.35 μg/mL measured 1 month after the infant series was comparable in the PCV13 (≥94.2%) and PCV7 (≥93.0%) groups for the 7 serotypes common to both vaccines. The percentage of responders for the 6 additional serotypes ranged from 87.1 to 100% for PCV13. The percentage of responders varied across the pertussis antigens studied, but was not different in PCV13 and PCV7 recipients. Overall, the safety profile of PCV13 was comparable with that of PCV7. Conclusions: PCV13 was comparable to PCV7 in safety and tolerability, elicited comparable immune responses to the common serotypes, and did not interfere with immune responses to concomitantly administered whole-cell pertussis vaccine.

295,295,Persistent impairments in humoral and cellular immunity in patients with immune thrombocytopenia treated with rituximab: A sub-study of a randomized controlled trial,"Background: The anti-CD20 antibody, rituximab, is increasingly being used as a treatment for immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). The concern about rare occurrences of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy in this population and the reliance on vaccine responses in patients who ultimately require splenectomy calls for additional studies into the integrity of the immune system after rituximab treatment. The objective of this study was to evaluate both the antibody and cellular responses to the Streptococcus pneumoniae polysaccharide vaccine and to the Haemophilus influenza type b (Hib) conjugate vaccine in rituximab-treated patients with ITP. Methods: Adults with primary ITP and a platelet count below 30 x109/L who had participated in a randomized trial of rituximab or placebo were eligible for this prospective sub-study. Six months after the study intervention, patients were given the S. pneumoniae polysaccharide vaccine (Pneumovax-23®, Merck) and the Hib conjugate vaccine (ActHIB®, Aventis). Antibodies against the pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide (anti-PCP) and Hib polyribosyl-ribitol phosphate (anti-PRP) were measured by EIA. A bactericidal assay was used to measure the ability to eradicate Hib in culture. An adequate antibody response was defined as a 4-fold increase in antibody concentration from baseline in the first month post vaccination. IgG anti-PRP 1 μg/mL was considered protective. For the bactericidal assay, a 4-fold increase from baseline was considered positive. CD3+ T-cells and total (CD19+), naïve (CD19+, CD27-), memory (CD19+, CD27+, CD38-) and pre-plasma (CD19low, CD27hi, CD38hi) B-cells were determined by flow cytometry before and after vaccinations. Interferon- (IFN-) secreting T-cells were measured by elispot. Results: Patients who had been randomized to receive rituximab (n=14) or placebo (n=6) participated in this prospective study. Compared with placebo, fewer patients in the rituximab group achieved an adequate antibody response to S. pneumonia vaccine (21.4% versus 66.7%) or the Hib vaccine (28.6% versus 83.3%). These results correlated with a reduced bactericidal effect of anti-PRP antibodies observed in patients treated with rituximab compared with placebo (14.2% versus 83.3%). Two patients in the rituximab group demonstrated an adequate rise in antibody titer but with no functional bactericidal activity. In addition, 3 patients who did not mount an adequate antibody response, had IgG anti-PRP titers below protective levels and did not demonstrate bactericidal activity in vitro were considered Hib vaccine failures. There were no Hib vaccine failures in the placebo group. In the rituximab group, total number of B-cells declined rapidly after treatment (1.895 x 104/mL) relative to the placebo group (5.65 x 104/mL) and never fully recovered even 1 year post-treatment. Resting memory B-cells were significantly reduced after rituximab and remained at low levels even up to 1 year. Conversely, naïve B-cells recovered to near normal levels within 6 months of treatment. Activated pre-plasma B-cells increased following vaccination in the placebo group; yet, this response was variable in patients who had received rituximab. CD3+ T-cell numbers were unaffected by rituximab and vaccination; however, the number of IFN- secreting T-cells were lower in the rituximab group. Conclusions: Rituximab treatment was associated with an impaired antibody response to vaccination, which in some patients was only demonstrated by impaired bactericidal activity. The expected increase in B-cell subsets was not observed following vaccination in the rituximab group, and T-cells, while normal in number, demonstrated functional impairments.

The concern about rare occurrences of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy in this population and the reliance on vaccine responses in patients who ultimately require splenectomy calls for additional studies into the integrity of the immune system after rituximab treatment. The objective of this study was to evaluate both the antibody and cellular responses to the Streptococcus pneumoniae polysaccharide vaccine and to the Haemophilus influenza type b (Hib) conjugate vaccine in rituximab-treated patients with ITP. Methods: Adults with primary ITP and a platelet count below 30 x109/L who had participated in a randomized trial of rituximab or placebo were eligible for this prospective sub-study. Six months after the study intervention, patients were given the S. pneumoniae polysaccharide vaccine (Pneumovax-23®, Merck) and the Hib conjugate vaccine (ActHIB®, Aventis). Antibodies against the pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide (anti-PCP) and Hib polyribosyl-ribitol phosphate (anti-PRP) were measured by EIA.

Ages ranged between 1 and 18, with 6% under 13 months old, and 85% under 8 years old. In 77%, FAA was performed because of recurrent RTI; 10% because of other recurrent infections; and in 13% no indication was documented. 35% of patients had low Haemophilus IgG, 79% of patients had low Pneumococcal IgG, and 1% of patients had low Tetanus IgG. 37/48 patients had low FAA; 29 of these patients were recommended to receive booster vaccines. 9/15 of parents reported reduction of RTI post booster vaccine. 10/12 of patients had their FAA documented to have returned to normal.

300,300,Immunologic responsiveness in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis on methotrexate and etanercept: 23 valent pneumococcal vaccination,"Background/Purpose: There is a paucity of data regarding response to vaccinations in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) treated with methotrexate (MTX). It is also unclear whether biologic agents affect vaccination response. Data was previously reported on the secondary response to protein vaccination with tetanus. This study investigates the primary response to polysaccharide vaccination in this same cohort. Methods: Patients with a diagnosis of polyarticular JIA on stable doses of NSAIDS and/or MTX for a minimum of 3 months were enrolled into this prospective study. All patients were naïve to both Pneumovax and Prevnar (7-valent) vaccines. All patients received 0.5 cc Pneumovax (23-valent) subcutaneously. Serum was obtained at vaccination and after 4-6 weeks. 12 Pneumoccocal serotypes were measured (1, 3, 4, 6b 7f, 8, 9n, 12f, 14, 18c, 19f, 23) by standard EIA. Positive response was considered a 2-fold increase in titer. 200 ng Ab N/mL was considered clinically protective by the clinical laboratory. Serum was subjected to C4 allotyping, immunoglobulin and complement levels to examine alternative causes for non-response. Statistical analysis was performed using parametric and non-parametric methods when appropriate. Results: 50 patients were included for analysis. 3 additional patients were excluded because of reaction to vaccination requiring steroid treatment. Patients were subdivided into MTX and non-MTX groups for primary analysis. 38 patients were on MTX (n=16 on MTX + etanercept) & 12 patients were on NSAIDS. There was no statistical difference between the 2 groups in the 2-fold response for all serotypes. In addition, there was no difference in 2-fold response in the etanercept+MTX vs MTX vs non-MTX groups. The number of serotypes each group responded to was similar. 39 patients had a response to at least 1 serotype (36 to at least 2). In 11 patients who did not respond, there were no differences in proportion of patients on MTX or etanercept. For each serotype, the pre-dose geometric mean concentrations (GMC) were all greater than 200 ng Ab N/ml. Post immunization GMCs were similar in 9 of 12 serotypes between the MTX and non-MTX groups. Etanercept use did not influence this result. In the other 3 serotypes (1, 6b, 23), the MTX group had significantly higher post-GMCs. There were significant increases in post-GMCs for all serotypes. There was no difference in geometric mean ratio (GMR) for 10 of 12 serotypes between the 2 groups. Of interest, for the other serotypes (1, 18c), the MTX group had a significantly higher GMR when compared to the non-MTX group.

301,301,Persistent pneumonia and bronchiectasis in a young man: An opportunity for a unifying diagnosis,"INTRODUCTION: Non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis is uncommon, and the cause of bronchiectasis is rarely found in up to 80% of cases. We describe a case of persistent pulmonary abscess, pneumonia and bronchiectasis in a young man found to have common variable immunodeficiency disease (CVID). CASE PRESENTATION: The patient is a 36 year old man who nine months prior, began experiencing fevers, malaise, shortness of breath and productive cough. He was treated several times for pneumonia with oral antibiotics without improvement. The patient continued to have fevers, and his sputum became foul smelling with occasional hemoptysis. Right lower lobe pneumonia with findings of a cavitary lesion and bilateral lower lobe bronchiectasis were found on chest computed tomography (CT). Sputum culture grew penicillin resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, and he was initiated on moxifloxacin. He had slow improvement of his chest CT findings on moxifloxacin and continued to experience malaise and productive, purulent sputum. Repeat sputum sample demonstrated a highly resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, including fluoroquinolones. On exam he appeared chronically ill and was afebrile. He had poor dentition. His lungs demonstrated bronchovesicular breath sounds in the right mid-lung. The remainder of the exam was normal. Laboratory evaluation demonstrated very low immunoglobulin levels (IgG <200 mg/dL, IgA<6 mg/dL, IgM 135 mg/dL) with no antibody response to tetanus, diphtheria, or pneumococcus. Alpha one antitrypsin levels, complement activity, rheumatoid factor and anti-neutrophilic antibody tests were all normal. Pulmonary function tests showed a fixed moderate obstructive pattern with a forced expiratory volume (FEV1) of 2.33 liters (61% of predicted), a total lung capacity of 5.96 liters (98% of predicted) and corrected diffusing capacity of 17.4 mL/min/mmHg (54% of predicted). The patient was initiated on intravenous immunoglobulin therapy (IVIG) and been slowly improving. DISCUSSION: Common variable immunodeficiency disease is a rare, heterogeneous genetic disorder with high morbidity and mortality. Recurrent infections, pulmonary disease, and lymphoma are common complications. Bronchiectasis is highly prevalent in this population.

Although IVIG is the standard treatment, it is unclear whether this affects the outcome underlying lung diseases.",FALSE,"Persistent pneumonia and bronchiectasis in a young man: An opportunity for a unifying diagnosisINTRODUCTION: Non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis is uncommon, and the cause of bronchiectasis is rarely found in up to 80% of cases. We describe a case of persistent pulmonary abscess, pneumonia and bronchiectasis in a young man found to have common variable immunodeficiency disease (CVID). CASE PRESENTATION: The patient is a 36 year old man who nine months prior, began experiencing fevers, malaise, shortness of breath and productive cough. He was treated several times for pneumonia with oral antibiotics without improvement. The patient continued to have fevers, and his sputum became foul smelling with occasional hemoptysis. Right lower lobe pneumonia with findings of a cavitary lesion and bilateral lower lobe bronchiectasis were found on chest computed tomography (CT). Sputum culture grew penicillin resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, and he was initiated on moxifloxacin. He had slow improvement of his chest CT findings on moxifloxacin and continued to experience malaise and productive, purulent sputum. Repeat sputum sample demonstrated a highly resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, including fluoroquinolones. On exam he appeared chronically ill and was afebrile. He had poor dentition. His lungs demonstrated bronchovesicular breath sounds in the right mid-lung. The remainder of the exam was normal. Laboratory evaluation demonstrated very low immunoglobulin levels (IgG <200 mg/dL, IgA<6 mg/dL, IgM 135 mg/dL) with no antibody response to tetanus, diphtheria, or pneumococcus. Alpha one antitrypsin levels, complement activity, rheumatoid factor and anti-neutrophilic antibody tests were all normal. Pulmonary function tests showed a fixed moderate obstructive pattern with a forced expiratory volume (FEV1) of 2.33 liters (61% of predicted), a total lung capacity of 5.96 liters (98% of predicted) and corrected diffusing capacity of 17.4 mL/min/mmHg (54% of predicted). The patient was initiated on intravenous immunoglobulin therapy (IVIG) and been slowly improving. DISCUSSION: Common variable immunodeficiency disease is a rare, heterogeneous genetic disorder with high morbidity and mortality. Recurrent infections, pulmonary disease, and lymphoma are common complications. Bronchiectasis is highly prevalent in this population. Studies have suggested that a significant delay in diagnosis (four years) from symptom onset to initiation of IVIG. This may contribute to increased mortality. Evidence-based treatments of bronchiectasis are lacking and largely based on expert opinion.

Currently available vaccines are based on the capsular polysaccharide. Polysaccharide vaccines are poorly immunogenic in those most at risk of disease. More recently developed polysaccharide/protein (PS) conjugated vaccines showed increased efficacy in the at risk group, yet are too expensive for developing countries where the burden of disease is greatest. Serotype replacement and capsular switching post vaccine introduction have shown clear limitations to the long-term potential of these vaccines. There is therefore a need to develop cheap serotype independent vaccines against pneumococcal disease. Materials and methods: Pneumolysin (PLY) acts as a powerful mucosal adjuvant to induce both systemic and mucosal immunity to proteins genetically fused to PLY after delivery intranasally or subcutaneously. In this work, S. pneumoniae virulence factors, PsaA, PspA, PspC and PhtD have been genetically fused to PLY and Δ6PLY, a PLY toxoid that lacks haemolytic activity but retains its immunogenic and adjuvant activity. The immune response to these fusion proteins was measured by ELISA. The ability of these fusion proteins to stimulate protective immunity against infection with S. pneumoniae was investigated in a murine colonisation model. Results: Here we show that proteins genetically fused to pneumolysin (PLY) become capable of generating an antibody response that is not seen when they are administered as a mix.

Objective: To report the course of a 7-year-old IRAK- 4-deficient girl presenting in the first year with multiple occult Staphylococcus aureus lymphadenitis. Methods: Clinical assessment, antibiotic prophylaxis (sulfa/trimethoprim/PenV, then - due to neutropenia - Cefprozil), pneumococcal vaccination (PCV-7, Pneumovax23, PCV-13), ELISA to monitor pneumococcal-specific IgG. Results: No bacterial infections occurred on prophylaxis for 6 years after initial presentation. IgG responses to pneumococcal polysaccharide were satisfactory but short-lived, requiring frequent boosting. At age 7, she developed a morning headache and vomited once. Cefprozil was administered and redosed. Over 12 hours, she was fatigued without other symptoms. Low fever accompanied another emesis. Hours later she was confused, and purpuric rash appeared.

Moreover, the blood-brain barrier (BBB) itself secretes cytokines and, because of the bipolar nature of the BBB, these substances can be secreted into either the CNS compartment or in the blood, so patients with acute bacterial meningitis frequently develop sepsis. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the cytokine/chemokine levels in different vessels and the BBB integrity after pneumococcal meningitis induction. Wistar rats were infected with Streptococcus pneumoniae, and the BBB integrity was investigated using Evan's blue dye.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE 2: Highlight the importance of early diagnosis to prevent spread of infection and to begin treatment promptly. CASE: A 19-year-old gentleman with a past medical history of chronic constipation and seasonal allergies presented with complaints of rectal pain for 1 week along with fever, chills and malaise. Prior to presentation, he had been evaluated at an outside hospital and underwent a rectal exam under anesthesia with no identification of abnormalities. On presentation at our institution, physical exam was significant for a low grade fever, maculopapular rash on his torso, and perianal mucosal ulcerations. Initial lab evaluation was significant for elevation of hepatic transaminases and thrombocytopenia. He was admitted for further treatment and evaluation, and ceftriaxone was initiated to cover for Gram-positive bacterial infections, including sexually transmitted diseases. Rectal swabs were negative for herpes simplex virus (HSV) and bacteria, including group A streptococcus and H. ducyeri. Further laboratory work-up was negative for viral hepatitis, syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia. Initial HIV antibody assay was also negative, but serum HSV serologies (IgG and IgM) were positive. When informed of his HSV infection, the patient admitted to having 13 male sexual partners in the last year, which prompted concern for an acute retroviral infection. HIV RNA PCR was ordered and revealed an HIV viral load of over 700,000. The patient was discharged home with outpatient infectious disease clinic follow-up. As an outpatient, antiretroviral medications were started, and the patient's HIV viral load eventually became undetectable after 6 months of therapy. DISCUSSION: Acute retroviral syndrome (ARS) describes the clinical signs and symptoms of primary HIV infection which includes the period from initial HIV infection to HIV seroconversion. The initial presenting signs and symptoms of primary HIV infection are often nonspecific. The most common presentation is an acute mononucleosis-like illness characterized by fever, sore throat and lymphadenopathy. Other symptoms include lethargy, malaise, myalgias, weight loss, headache and a diffuse maculopapular rash. Acute retroviral syndrome can also involve multiple organ systems. Mucosal ulcerations of the oropharynx, esophagus and the genitalia have been reported to occur in 28%, 17%, and 6% of patient's respectively. Involvement of the gastrointestinal system can include vomiting and diarrhea along with pancreatitis, colitis and epiglottitis. Hepatitis is a common presentation that often resolves as the host's immune system gains control over the initial viral replication. Other laboratory abnormalities include anemia, leukopenia and thrombocytopenia. Neurologic involvement most commonly includes headaches but can also include aseptic meningitis or encephalitis. The signs and symptoms of ARS usually begin within 2- 4 weeks of initial HIV infection and last approximately 2-3 weeks. During the primary HIV infection, the viral load is very high and the patient is highly infectious. Early identification is important, not only for initiation of antiretroviral therapy to preserve the host's immune responses, but also to decrease transmission through patient education and therapy.

Outbreaks occur commonly during summer and affect mostly children and infants. Nosocomial outbreaks have been reported worldwide emphasizing the need for control measures to be taken. We describe an outbreak of eight cases concerning neonates hospitalized in our neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) during July and August of 2011. Methods: Eight neonates 8-30 days old, with gestational age of 28-41 weeks and birth weight 1210- 3600 g, inpatients of our NICU presented with fever (>38.5°C) and no other symptoms. A laboratory investigation was performed in all cases: CRP, complete blood count, bacterial cultures of urine, blood, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), stools. Because of the mild clinical course of the illness and the sequential appearance of the cases a viral agent was suspected and a polymerase chain reaction was performed in CSF and stool specimens for herpes viruses and enteroviruses. Results: All neonates had increased cell counts in CSF at first day of illness (mean: 341/mm3 range: 130-900/mm3) with predominance of lymphocytes in six out of eight cases. CSF glucose and protein concentration were normal in all cases. Gram stain and antigen detection test for Streptococcus agalactiae and Escherichia coli K1 were negative. All bacterial cultures failed to demonstrate any bacterial agent. CRP was always negative. RNA of Echo-6 virus was detected in all CSF specimens as well as four stool specimens.

318,318,Prevalence of urinary tract infections in febrile infants <90 days old with RSV,"Background: The prevalence of significant bacterial infections in infants <90 days old who have RSV is unknown in the era after the introduction of H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae vaccinations. Objectives: The study's hypothesis is that infants with fever and RSV are at low risk for secondary bacterial infections and may not require extensive and invasive laboratory evaluations. Methods: Prospective evaluation of all infants <90 days old who had sepsis evaluations for fever and an RSV antigen test performed. Data were analyzed using Stata 11 with continuous variables expressed as means, while categorical variables were summarized as frequencies of occurrence and assessed for statistical significance using chi-squared test or Fisher's exact. Results: There were 360 infants; 140 (38.8%) were RSV (+) and 220 (61.1%) were RSV (-). In the RSV (+) group, the median temperature was 38.6 ± 0.6°C, while in the RSV (-) group it was 38.5 ± 0.5°C. There was no significant difference in vital signs between groups. There were more coryza and coughing in the RSV (+) group (p < 0.05). There were 16 (11.4%) infants admitted to the PICU in the RSV (+) group versus 4 (1.8%) in the RSV (-). The laboratory evaluation in the RSV (+) included a CBC 130 (92.8%), urinalysis and culture 124 (88.5%), blood culture 126 (90.0%), chest radiograph 102 (72.8%), and CSF fluid analysis 62 (44.2%).

There were more chest radiographs performed in the RSV (+) group (p < 0.05), while all other tests were similar. There were 20 (14.2%) significant infections in the RSV (+) group versus 24 (10.9%) in the RSV (-) group. In the RSV (+) group there were 14 (10%) pneumonias, 6 (4.2%) UTI.

Guidelines are being elaborated regarding the monitoring of immune recovery post HSCT, especially in heavily pre-treated patients. Patients and Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the immune recovery in 7 children with very high risk leukemia (4 ALL, 3 AML) with median age 9 years (2-15 yrs), transplanted in complete remission, (CR), CR1 (n=5) or CR 2 (n=2) and surviving >12 months post HSCT.

The objective of this study was to examine the distribution of acute meningoencephalitis and its aetiological agents among children admitted to a tertiary hospital in southern Bangladesh. Methods: This prospective study was carried out in Khulna Medical College Hospital from 2007 to 2009. All of the admitted children between 1 month and 12 years of age were enrolled over a 2-year period if they met the inclusion criteria of having an acute onset of fever (≤ 14 days) and any of the following 3 signs: neck stiffness, convulsion, or altered mental status. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was collected within hours and sent to the laboratory for cytological and biochemical analyses. CSF was examined by Gram staining and a latex agglutination test to detect common bacteria. Serum and CSF were also tested for Japanese encephalitis virus antibodies. Results: A total of 140 children were included in the study, which accounted for 2.5% of admissions between 2007 and 2009. The number of acute meningoencephalitis cases was relatively higher (37.9%) during the monsoon season. The CSF report revealed a pyogenic form in 24 (18.5%) and a viral form in 13 (10.0%) cases. Altered mental status was significantly less frequent (P < 0.001) in cases of pyogenic meningoencephalitis (62.5%) than in cases of non-pyogenic meningoencephalitis (93.4%).

S. suis infects the host through the respiratory route, reaches the bloodstream, and persists until breaching into the central nervous system. The capsular polysaccharide (CPS) of S. suis type 2 is considered a key virulence factor of the bacteria. Though CPS allows S. suis to adhere to the membrane of cells of the immune system, it provides protection against phagocytosis. In fact, nonencapsulated mutants are easily internalized and killed by macrophages and dendritic cells. The objective of this work was to study the molecular mechanisms by which the CPS of S. suis prevents phagocytosis. By using latex beads covalently linked with purified CPS, it was shown that CPS itself was sufficient to inhibit entry of both latex beads and bystander fluorescent beads into macrophages. Upon contact with macrophages, encapsulated S. suis was shown to destabilize lipid microdomains at the cell surface, to block nitric oxide (NO) production during infection, and to prevent lactosylceramide accumulation at the phagocytic cup during infection. In contrast, the nonencapsulated mutant was easily internalized via lipid rafts, in a filipin-sensitive manner, leading to lactosylceramide recruitment and strong NO production.

326,326,Advances in meningococcal vaccines,"SUMMARY During the 20th century, meningococcal vaccine manufacturers took advantage of conjugate technology to provide products that could protect infants, the most vulnerable population, against invasive disease caused by serogroup C.

327,327,"Guidelines for screening, prophylaxis and critical information prior to initiating anti-TNF-alpha treatment","These national clinical guidelines outlining the screening, prophylaxis and critical information required prior to initiating anti-TNF-alpha treatment have been approved by the Danish Society for Gastroenterology. Anti-TNF-alpha therapy is widely used in gastroenterology (for inflammatory bowel disease), rheumatology (for rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis and spondyloarthropathies) and dermatology (for psoriasis). With this background, the Danish Society for Gastroenterology established a group of experts to assess evidence for actions recommended before treatment with anti-TNF-alpha agents. Screening should take place for both active tuberculosis and latent tuberculosis. Screening must evaluate the risk of hepatitis B exposure/infection and that of other viral infections such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and varicella zoster virus (VZV). The assessment should include a history of previous malignancies (cases of malignant disease within 5 years of anti-TNF-alpha treatment should be carefully considered). The physical examination should include lung/heart auscultation and lymph node examination, and the paraclinical investigations should include chest X-rays and laboratory tests, including an interferon gamma release assay, a hepatitis B test, an HIV test and, when prior VZV infection is uncertain, a VZV antibody test. Prophylaxis: Isoniazid should be administered in cases of suspected latent TB infection. Antiviral treatment is recommended in HBsAg-positive patients at the start of anti-TNF-alpha treatment. Before anti-TNF-alpha therapy, vaccination with 23-valent pneumococcal vaccine is recommended, and HBV vaccination may be considered in seronegative patients. Annual vaccination against seasonal influenza is recommended. Human papilloma virus vaccination should be administered in accordance with the guidelines of the National Board of Health of Denmark.

333,333,Streptococcus pneumoniae induces release of von Willebrand factor from primary human endothelial cells,"Introduction: Streptococcus pneumoniae is colonizing the human nasopharyngeal cavity. Invasive pneumococcal infections cause meningitis, pneumonia and septic dissemination within the vascular system (Cartwright, 2002). The pore-forming cytotoxin pneumolysin is described as a major virulence factor of pneumococci (Mitchell and Mitchell, 2010). Pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HPMEC) form the inner lining of blood microvessels and produce specialized storage granules named Weibel-Palade Bodies (WPB). WPB contain procoagulant factors like von Willebrand factor (vWF) and proinflammatory interleukin 8 (IL-8) and are released in response to inflammatory or stress-related stimuli (Weibel and Palade 1964; Rondaij et al., 2004). Material and Methods: Confluently grown primary HPMEC were cultured on glass cover slips or in two chamber transwell systems and were infected with serotype 35A and serotype 2 pneumococci and with pneumolysin-deficient mutants. Bacterial adherence and WPB exocytosis was visualized by immune fluorescence microscopy. Cell confluency was controlled by measurement of biological impedance using the CellZscope (Nanoanalytics). Quantification of vWF and IL-8 within cell culture supernatant was performed by ELISA. Results: Microscopic quantification demonstrated that pneumococcal adherence to confluent HPMEC correlates with a decreasing amount of intracellular WPB. Following time course of infection with pneumococci, increasing amounts of vWF and IL-8 were determined in cell culture supernatants. Release of vWF and of IL8 was slightly lower after infection with pneumolysin-deficient pneumococcal mutants compared to wild-type bacteria, but sublytical amounts of recombinant pneumolysin significantly stimulated WPB exocytosis in similar levels as physiological agonists like histamine and thrombin. Moreover, the vWF release was determined in cell culture supernatant after infection of HPMEC from apical and basolateral cell surface in equal amounts. Discussion: This report describes for the first time an induction of WPB exocytosis by pneumococcal adherence and by the cytotoxin pneumolysin using primary lung endothelial cells. The stimulation of vWF and IL8 release after apical and basolateral infection implies a stimulation of WPB exocytosis in both directions: from inside the vasculature and also following invasive pneumococcal transmigration from pulmonary tissue into the bloodstream.

Although not demonstrated in vivo, the pathogenesis of pneumococcal HUS has been attributed to the action pneumococcal neuraminidase exposing the usually cryptic Thomsen-Friedenreich antigen (T-antigen) on red blood cells (RBC), and kidney glomeruli. We evaluated the effect of pneumococcal infection on desialylation of RBC and glomeruli during pneumococcal infections in mice. Following intravenous infection with capsular type 19F pneumococci, CFU levels exceeding 1000 CFU/mL blood by the third day were significantly more likely to result in exposed T-antigen on RBC than lower levels of bacteremia. In a pneumonia model, significantly more T-antigen was exposed on RBC in mice treated with penicillin than in those receiving mock treatment.

A phase III study evaluated the immunogenicity and safety of an investigational Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) - Neisseria meningitidis serogroups C and Y-tetanus toxoid conjugate vaccine (HibMenCY). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 4180 infants were randomly assigned to receive the HibMenCY at the ages of 2, 4, 6, and 12 to 15 months or the licensed Hib tetanus toxoid conjugate vaccine (ActHIB) at 2, 4, and 6 months and Hib conjugated to N meningitidis outer membrane protein (PedvaxHIB) at 12 to 15 months. Routinely scheduled vaccines were coadministered. Serum bactericidal activity using human complement and anti-polyribosylribitol phosphate antibodies were assessed in 991 subjects. Local and systemic adverse reactions were recorded for 4 days after each dose. RESULTS: The percentage of HibMenCY recipients with serum bactericidal assay using human complement titers of 1:8 or higher after dose 3 was 98.8% for N meningitidis serogroup C (MenC) and 95.8% for N meningitidis serogroup Y (MenY). After dose 4, the percentages were 98.5% and 98.8%, respectively. The percentage of HibMenCY recipients with postdose 3 anti-polyribosylribitol phosphate antibody levels of ≥1.0 μg/mLwas noninferior to that of control (96.3% vs 91.2%). After dose 4, MenC and MenY serum bactericidal assay using human complement antibody titers increased 12-fold over pre-dose 4 levels. Incidence of pain, redness, and swelling at the HibMenCY injection sites tended to be lower than with Hib type b after the first 3 doses and after the fourth dose. Rates of systemic symptoms were similar across groups. CONCLUSIONS: The HibMenCY was immunogenic against MenC and MenY and induced anti- polyribosylribitol phosphate antibody levels noninferior to those of licensed Hib conjugate vaccine.

The main objective of this 3.5 year project is to assess European GBS epidemiology in order to facilitate the design of a new vaccine capable of conferring broad coverage to immunize neonates against GBS infections through a durable maternal immune response. A key component of the programme was to undertake a multicentre surveillance study of maternal GBS colonisation, maternal GBS antibody levels and neonatal GBS infection in the UK. Methods: Four UK centres from different geographical locations participated. Maternal vaginal/rectal swabs and serum samples were taken between 34-37 weeks gestation and processed using a standardised microbiological screening protocol. Samples from neonatal cases (early onset disease; EOD & late onset disease; LOD) were processed using local procedures. GBS isolates were characterised at the HPAMSD using standardised serological and molecular typing methods based on the Strep-B-Latex agglutination kit & a novel multiplex PCR assay which detects all ten GBS capsular polysaccharide types (Ia to IX). Maternal sera from colonised & non-colonised women together with maternal and neonatal GBS isolates were submitted to Rome for analysis. Results: A total of 650 pregnant women were recruited between 34-37 weeks gestation, from June 2009 to April 2010, of which 170 were colonised with GBS (incidence rate ∼26%). GBS isolates from 16 neonatal cases (13 EOD & 3 LOD) together with corresponding maternal sera were also obtained. The most common GBS capsular types were III (33%), Ia (26%) & V (17%), respectively. Conclusion: In contrast to most EU countries, the UK does not offer routine GBS antenatal screening however, results from the clinical studies that we have undertaken should raise more awareness and support routine GBS screening for the prevention of early-onset neonatal GBS disease in the UK. The maternal incidence rate of 26% is consistent with the rates quoted in other European countries.

In 2008-2009 we see a sudden rise of this serotype in Malaysia representing second most common (9.68%) serotype of all invasive isolate. The aim of this study was to characterize pneumococcal strains of the 19A serotype received from various hospitals. Methods: Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) based on 7 housekeeping genes aroE, gdh, gki, recP, spi, xpt and ddl were carried out to determine the population structure of pneumococcal strains serotype 19A. Penicillin, amoxi-clavulanic acid, ceftriaxone, erythromycin, meropenem and levofloxacin MICs were determined using the E-test method (AB Biodisk, Solna, Sweden).

Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) offer a new possibility to reduce the incidence of pneumococcal infections and there are plans to use them also in adult population. Therefore, the aim of this study was to describe the characteristics of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) among Polish adults and to determine the coverage of the serotypes by different pneumococcal vaccines. Methods: The study was performed on all invasive S. pneumoniae isolated from adults older than 54 in Poland between 2006 and 2009, and collected in the National Reference Centre for Bacterial Meningitis (NRCBM). All the strains were identified based on typical morphology, Gram stain, susceptibility to optochin and bile solubility. Serotypes of S. pneumoniae were determined by the Pneumotest-Latex kit, a PCR or the the Quellung reaction. MICs were determined by the Etest method. Results: Among 725 invasive pneumococcal isolates collected during the study period, 260 (35.9%) were isolated from patients older than 54 years. Among them 37 different serotypes were identified along with 3 nontypeable isolates. The most common were isolates of serotype 3 (14.3%), 12F and 14 (8.9% each). Together with 1, 23F, 9V, 4 and 9N they accounted for 65.3% of all serotypes.

344,344,Serotyping of Streptococcus pneumoniae strains isolated in Algeria,"Objectives: The aim of this work is the study of Streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes isolated in many algerian cities, their distribution by localisation site, and the evaluation of the theoretical coverage for conjugate vaccines. Methods: Our study was performed on 256 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, collected from January 2001 to July 2010. These isolates came from various samples: CSF (Cerebrospinal fluid) (n = 104); blood (n = 36), ascitic, pleural, peritoneal and gastric fluid (n = 14); nasal, throat and ear swabs (n = 61); lung samples (n = 25) and finally, fistulae (n = 16). Among these strains, 45.6% came from children, of which 33.3% were under 5 years of age. The strains were identified using the usual tests. For serotyping, we use the latex particle agglutination (Statens Serum Institut Pneumotest-Latex), and the capsular swelling test using monovalent sera (Statens Serum Institut). Results: The most common serotypes were: 14 (19,5%), 23F (9,7%), 6B (9,3%), 19F (5,4%) and serotype 1 (5%). The frequency of these serotypes in invasive sites in children under 5 years is 14 (31.25%), 23F (10.4%), 19F (8.3%), 6B (6.25%) and serotype 1 (4.2%).

345,345,Pyogenic ventriculitis in adult patients with pneumococcal meningitis,"Objectives: S. pneumoniae is the leading cause of communityacquired bacterial meningitis among adults. With 15 to 30% pneumococcal meningitis (PM) still has a very high case fatality rate, more than half of survivors develop long term sequelae. This unfavourable clinical outcome is often due to intracranial complications. Among those, pyogenic ventriculitis is believed to to be rather rare. Systematic prospective studies are missing. Diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) is an accepted tool for diagnosing pyogenic ventriculitis. In this study, we scanned consecutive patients with PM for pyogenic ventriculitis using DWI. Methods: Between January 2009 and now nine patients (age range 32-69 years) with a definite diagnosis of PM based on positive cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) culture, Gram stain, or antigen detection (latex particle agglutination) were included. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed between day 1 and day 25 after admission depending on the patients clinical condition. The sequence protocol comprised axial fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR)-weighted, DWI-weighted, and T1-weighted spin echo sequences, prior to and after the administration of intravenous contrast-agent. Results: DWI revealed intraventricular material with diffusion restriction, corresponding to intraventricular pus, within the occipital horns of one (n = 2) or both (n = 7) lateral ventricles in all patients. Ventricular diffusion-restriction was observed as early as one day after diagnosing the disease. It was accompanied by periventricular contrast enhancement in three patients. In one patient with a complicated clinical course serial MRI scans were performed that showed increase of ventricular empyema with clinical deterioration and only slow resolution with persisting restricted diffusion up to 43 days after admission. Follow-up MRI that was performed in five patients between three and twelve months after discharge, showed complete resolution of ventricular diffusion-restricted areas. Conclusions: By systematic scanning of patients with PM using DWI we showed that all examined patients displayed ventricular diffusion-restriction reflecting pyogenic ventriculitis. We therefore conclude that pyogenic ventriculitis is an underestimated complication in patients with PM.

No guidelines exist regarding the monitoring of immune recovery post HSCT, especially in heavily pre-treated patients. Patients and methods: We retrospectively analyzed the immune recovery in 7 children with very high risk leukemia (4 ALL, 3 AML) with median age of 9 years (2-15yrs), transplanted in complete remission, (CR), CR1 (n=5) or CR 2 (n=2) and surviving> 12 months post HSCT. All received myeloablative conditioning. Donors were HLA genoidentical (n=3), haploidentical (n=1), unrelated (n=2), unrelated cord blood (n=1). All patients had complete chimerism at 3,6, 12,24,36 months. Lymphocyte subpopulations CD3, CD4, CD8, NK, CD19, were available at 3, 6, 12, 24, 36 months and γ/delta T, CD45R0, CD45RA at 12 and 36 months post HSCT. Lymphocyte proliferation to mitogens (PHA, Con A, PWM) and antigens (Tetanus, Diphtheria, Streptococcus, Candida, Proteus, PPD) were done at 6,12,24,36 months post HSCT. Antibodies against Tetanus, Diphtheria, Pneumococcal 14, 19, 23,and H. influenza were tested at 12, 24, and 36 months post-transplant. Results: CD3, CD8, CD19 normalized at 6 months, CD4 at 24 months, NK at 3 months, γ/delta cells at 12 months and CD45 RA, CD45 R0 at 36 months post HSCT. Mitogen proliferations were normal at 12 months and antigen proliferations between 12 and 36 months post HSCT. Antibody responses following vaccinations to all the antigens tested were normal at 12 months post HSCT; however there was a decrease over the follow up period especially in Pneumococcal antigens, necessitating revaccination. Conclusions: This small retrospective study shows that for heavily treated and very high risk leukemia patients in the pediatric age, complete immune recovery is achieved 3 years post HSCT.

348,348,Detection of bacterial pathogens in Mongolia meningitis surveillance with a new real-time PCR assay to detect Haemophilus influenzae,"Since the implementation of Haemophilus influenzae (Hi) serotype b vaccine, other serotypes and non-typeable strains have taken on greater importance as a cause of Hi diseases. A rapid and accurate method is needed to detect all Hi regardless of the encapsulation status. We developed 2 real-time PCR (rt-PCR) assays to detect specific regions of the protein D gene (hpd). Both hpd assays are very specific and sensitive for detection of Hi. Of the 63 non-Hi isolates representing 21 bacterial species, none was detected by the hpd #1 assay, and only one of 2 H. aphrophilus isolates was detected by the hpd #3 assay. The hpd #1 and #3 assays detected 97% (229/237) and 99% (234/237) of Hi isolates, respectively, and were superior for detection of both typeable and non-typeable Hi isolates, as compared to previously developed rt-PCR targeting ompP2 or bexA. The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of these rt-PCR assays were assessed on cerebrospinal fluid specimens collected as part of meningitis surveillance in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia. The etiology (Neisseria meningitidis, Hi, and Streptococcus pneumoniae) of 111 suspected meningitis cases was determined by conventional methods (culture and latex agglutination), previously developed rt-PCR assays, and the new hpd assays. The rt-PCR assays were more sensitive for detection of meningitis pathogens than other classical methods and improved detection from 50% (56/111) to 75% (83/111). The hpd #3 assay identified a non-b Hi that was missed by the bexA assay and other methods.

349,349,Meningitis secondary to a sphenoid defect,"Case Presentation: A 45-year-old woman with a history of chronic migraines and diabetes was brought to the emergency room for decreased responsiveness with hypoxic respiratory failure. She had been treated for migraines at an outside facility the day prior and had not recovered from sedative medications. Other medications prior to admission included amitriptyline, and butalbital-acetaminophen-caffeine. She had no history of facial trauma or head and neck surgery. On admission, the patient was febrile (38.1°C), unresponsive, and intubated. Lumbar puncture confirmed meningitis with neutrophil-predominate pleocytosis (9479 cells/mm3, 91% neutrophils) and hypoglycorrhachia (<10 mg/dL; normal, 40-70 mg/dL). Bacterial antigens were positive for Streptococcus pneumoniae, which also grew in blood cultures. Although maintained on mechanical ventilation and appropriate antibiotic treatment, the patient developed profuse clear to blood-tinged rhinorrhea (up to 600 mL/day) that had an undetectable glucose concentration on spot testing sticks. Because of a suspicion of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak, otolaryngology recommended testing the fluid for beta-2 transferrin, which was positive. Computed tomography (CT) of the sinuses revealed fluid in the left sphenoid sinus with a defect in the posterior sphenoid bone. The defect was corrected via endoscopic transnasal, trans-sphenoid ablation, where the sphenoid fossa was packed with abdominal fat and sealed with grafted nasal cartilage. Rhinorrhea and migraines resolved completely and have not recurred. Discussion: Basal skull defects are congenital, and symptoms include (recurrent) meningitis and/or CSF rhinorrhea. This exceedingly rare cause of meningitis can present in adulthood with the above symptoms. Although sphenoid encephaloceles and meningoencephaloceles have been associated with meningitis and CSF rhinorrhea, there is little literature regarding nontraumatic sphenoid sinus defects as a cause of these complications. Diagnosis can be confirmed by high-resolution CT or magnetic resonance imaging. In our case, the CSF leak likely developed spontaneously from inflammation of the meninges in the setting of the sphenoid defect. Moreover, the area directly posterior to the defect showed the most significant meningeal inflammation on magnetic resonance imaging, consistent with this area as the source of infection.

S. suis is also recognized as a zoonotic agent and expresses several virulence factors. The recently identified subtilisin-like protease (SspA) of S. suis plays an important role in the pathogenicity of this bacterium in animal models. The objective of the present study was to clone, purify, and characterize the SspA of serotype 2 S. suis P1/7. The SSU0757 gene encoding SspA was amplified and a 4798-bp DNA fragment was obtained. It was cloned into the expression plasmid pBAD/HisB and then inserted into Escherichia coli to overproduce the protein. The recombinant protease was purified by chromatography procedures and showed a molecular weight of 170. kDa by SDS-PAGE. Its activity was optimal at pH 7 and at temperatures ranging from 25 °C to 37 °C. It had a high specificity for the chromogenic substrate succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-pNa while specific inhibitors of serine proteases inhibited its activity. In addition to degrading gelatin, the protease hydrolyzed the Aα chain of fibrinogen, which prevented fibrin formation by thrombin. The recombinant subtilisin-like protease also showed toxicity towards brain microvascular endothelial cells. Lastly, sera from pigs infected with S. suis reacted with the recombinant SspA, indicating that it is produced during infections. In conclusion, the SspA of S. suis shared similarities with subtilisin-like proteases produced by other pathogenic streptococci and may contribute to the pathogenic process of S. suis infections. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.",FALSE,"Purification and characterization of the subtilisin-like protease of Streptococcus suis that contributes to its virulenceStreptococcus suis is a major swine pathogen that is responsible for severe infections such as meningitis, endocarditis, and septicemia.

GBS may cause perinatal infection and premature birth in pregnant women. The aim of this study was to serotype GBS strains isolated from clinical samples and evaluate their serotype distribution according to their susceptibilities to antibiotics and isolation sites. Material and Methods: One hundred thirty one S. agalactiae strains isolated from the clinical samples were included in the study. Of the strains, 99 were isolated from urine, 20 from soft tissue, 10 from blood and 2 from vaginal swab. Penicillin G and ceftriaxone susceptibilities of GBS were determined by the agar dilution method. Susceptibilities to erythromycin, clindamycin, vancomycin and tetracycline were determined by the Kirby-Bauer method according to CLSI criteria. Serotyping was performed using the latex aglutination method using specific antisera (Ia, Ib, II-VIII). Results: While in 131 GBS strains, serotypes VII and VIII were not detected, the most frequently isolated serotypes were types Ia (36%), III (30.5%) and II (13%) respectively. Serotype Ia was the most frequently seen serotype in all samples. All GBS isolates were susceptible to penicilin G, ceftriaxone and vancomycin.

356,356,The SspA subtilisin-like protease of Streptococcus suis triggers a pro-inflammatory response in macrophages through a non-proteolytic mechanism,"Background: Streptococcus suis is a major swine pathogen worldwide that causes meningitis, septicemia, arthritis, and endocarditis. Using animal models, a surface-associated subtilisin-like protease (SspA) has recently been shown to be an important virulence factor for S. suis. In this study, we hypothesized that the S. suis SspA subtilisin-like protease may modulate cytokine secretion by macrophages thus contributing to the pathogenic process of meningitis. Results: Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-differentiated U937 macrophages were stimulated with recombinant SspA prior to monitor cytokine secretion by ELISA. Our results indicated that the recombinant SspA was able to dose-dependently induce IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, CXCL8 and CCL5 secretion in macrophages. The heat-inactivated protease was still able to induce cytokine secretion suggesting a non-proteolytic mechanism of macrophage activation. Using specific kinase inhibitors, evidence were bought that cytokine secretion by macrophages stimulated with the recombinant SspA involves the mitogen-activated protein kinase signal transduction pathway. While stimulation of macrophages with low concentrations of recombinant SspA was associated to secretion of high amounts of CCL5, the use of recombinant SspA at a high concentration resulted in low amounts of CCL5 detected in the conditioned medium. This was found to be associated with a proteolytic degradation of CCL5 by SspA. The ability of SspA to induce cytokine secretion in macrophages was confirmed using a mutant of S. suis deficient in SspA expression. Conclusion: In conclusion, this study identified a new mechanism by which the S. suis SspA may promote central nervous system inflammation associated with meningitis. © 2011 Bonifait and Grenier; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",FALSE,"The SspA subtilisin-like protease of Streptococcus suis triggers a pro-inflammatory response in macrophages through a non-proteolytic mechanismBackground: Streptococcus suis is a major swine pathogen worldwide that causes meningitis, septicemia, arthritis, and endocarditis.

363,363,Defects in lymphocyte subsets and serological memory persist a median of 10 years after high dose therapy and autologous progenitor cell rescue for malignant lymphoma,"The number of survivors who have undergone high-dose chemotherapy (HDT) with autologous progenitor cell rescue for malignant lymphoma is increasing. Data on long-term immunological reconstitution is limited, particularly for lymphocyte populations that are now more readily enumerated. Despite consensus guidelines, routine primary revaccination of this patient population has not been universally adopted. Methods: From the Wessex Blood and Bone Marrow Transplant Registry, 130 patients (pts.) with malignant lymphoma, who had undergone HDT, and were known to be in an ongoing continuous remission for at least 3 years were identified and invited to participate with the aim of quantifying lymphocyte subsets and serological memory. Thirty-seven pts., median age 52 years (range 30-71) consented to study participation; their histologies comprised: diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, 32%; Hodgkin's disease, 27%; follicular lymphoma, 27%; other lymphomas, 14%. The median follow-up from the time of HDT to study entry was 10.6 years (range 3.0-20.2). All, except 4 pts., had received peripheral blood derived progenitor cells, which had been purged in 2 pts. An age matched population (median 56 years) of 14 healthy individuals (predominantly patient spouses) served as controls. Lymphocyte subsets in peripheral blood were assessed using multicolour flow cytometric analysis with a 16 antibody panel. Serum antibody levels to measles, mumps, rubella, HiB, tetanus and pneumococcus were determined by ELISA. Results: There was no significant difference in T, B and NK-cell populations between long-term follow-up pts. and controls, however even at median follow-up of 10 years there were persisting altered CD4+/CD8+ ratios with a reduced proportion of CD4+ cells in pts. compared to controls (median CD4+ 43% vs. 63% respectively; P<0.001). Naïve CD4+ cells were profoundly reduced in patients (P<0.001) yet effector memory and central memory CD4+ cells were higher in the pts. (P<0.001 and P=0.009 respectively).The effector memory RA population (intermediate between naïve and effector T-cells) were found in similar proportions between pts. and controls. Within the CD8+ population, the naïve population was reduced (P<0.001) with a corresponding increase in CD8+ memory cells in pts (p<0.001) however there was no difference in the level of central and effector memory CD8+ cells between pts. and controls. CD4+ T-cell numbers positively correlated with time form transplant, showing a continuous linear relationship. There were no significant differences in the proportion of memory and naïve B-cells between pts. and controls. Similarly there was no difference in marginal zone-like, class switch subtyes and mature plasmablasts proportions between the two groups. Uptake of revaccination following HDT was sporadic. Despite only 15 pts. (and only 1 pt receiving full course) being revaccinated, all patients demonstrated tetanus antibody levels above the minimal protective level. In two pts. who had received only a single dose of tetanus vaccine had antibody levels only just above the minimum. No pts. had been revaccinated against measles, mumps or rubella: 58%, 43% and 23% of pts respectively were below the equivocal serological level for immunity.

Four pts. had been vaccination against pneumococcus pre HDT and 13 pts. post: In 33% pts. antibody levels were below the minimum protective level. Conclusions: Even at a median of 10 years following curative HDT, defects in lymphocyte subsets persist. The sustained reduction in naïve T-cell subsets, likely as a result of thymic incapacity, resulted in a peripheral T-cell population with a restricted TCR repertoire and the potential for impaired responses to novel antigenic stimuli many years after HDT. Other lymphocyte lineages however were able to fully reconstitute. Lack of serologically determined immunity was common, and the risk of incomplete vaccination scheduling demonstrated.

MBL replacement may offer a therapeutic option in select cases to prevent severe complications. Methods: Case Review Results: 50 year old non-smoking male with allergic rhinosinusitis, mild asthma and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) presented with recurrent fungal pneumonia complicated by chronic necrotizing pulmonary aspergillosis (CNPA) resulting in left upper lobectomy followed by 1 month of amphotericin B and itraconazole for tissue and sputum culture positive Aspergillus fumigatus. No history of abscesses, eczema or any other recurrent infections and PPD negative. Cough recurred 1 week after antibiotics stopped and sputum and bronchoalveolar fluid cultures positive for Scopulariopsis and Aspergillus, respectively. Treated with 6 months of caspofungin and prednisone 20mg then maintained on prednisone 10mg qOD and advair 500/50 BID. Work-up revealed an undetectable MBL level (<25ng/mL) without other immune defects: normal nitroblue tetrazolium test, quantitative and specific immunoglobulins (to pneumococcus and tetanus), CH50, CD16/56+ cells and T-cell proliferation to Candida. Absolute CD3+ and CD19+ cells were initially decreased at 613 (range 710-4,180) and 25 (range 70-910), respectively; however, fraction of CD3+ cells were normal at 73% (range 59-87%), consistent with acute infection with normalization after antibiotic course: CD3+ 1,349 (67%) and CD19+ 141 (7%).

Conclusions: MBL-deficiency in the setting of an underlying infectious burden, e.g. ABPA, can lead to worse outcomes, e.g. CNPA. This case supports the hypothesis that MBL plays an important role in modulation of the severity of certain infections. In vitro studies have shown strong MBL binding to Aspergillus and retrospective analyses have found patients with CNPA to have low levels of MBL vs controls.

Due to ongoing serotype replacement, current efforts are focused in an attempt to identify the pneumococcal antigens that could be used in a next-generation multivalent protein vaccine. The objective of our study was to use real-time PCR to determine the distribution and clonal type variability of PsrP, a protective pneumococcal antigen, among pneumococcal isolates from children with IPD or healthy nasopharyngeal carriers. psrP was detected in 52.4% of the 441 strains tested. While no differences were determined when the prevalence of psrP in colonizing strains (n = 89) versus that in all invasive strains (n = 352) was compared, a strong trend was observed when the prevalence of psrP in all pneumonia isolates (n = 209) and colonizing isolates (P = 0.067) was compared, and a significant difference was observed when the prevalence in all pneumonia isolates and those causing bacteremia (n = 76) was compared (P = 0.001). An age-dependent distribution of psrP was also observed, with the incidence of psrP being the greatest in strains isolated from children >2 years of age (P = 0.02). Strikingly, the presence of psrP within a serotype was highly dependent on the clonotype, with all isolates of invasive clones such as clonal complex 306 carrying psrP (n = 88), whereas for sequence type 304, only 1 of 19 isolates carried psrP; moreover, this was inversely correlated with antibiotic susceptibility. This finding suggests that inclusion of psrP in a vaccine formulation would not target resistant strains. We conclude that psrP is highly prevalent in strains that cause IPD but is most prevalent in strains isolated from older children with pneumonia.

369,369,A randomized clinical trial comparing revaccination with pneumococcal conjugate vaccine to polysaccharide vaccine among HIV-infected adults,"Background. The risk of pneumococcal disease persists, and antibody responses to revaccination with the 23-valent polysaccharide vaccine (PPV) are low among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) - infected adults. We determined whether revaccination with the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) would enhance these responses. Methods. In a randomized clinical trial, we compared the immunogenicity of revaccination with PCV (n=131) or PPV (n=73) among HIV-infected adults (median CD4 cell count, 533 cells/mm3) who had been vaccinated with PPV 3-8 years earlier. HIV-uninfected adults (n=25) without prior pneumococcal vaccination received 1 dose of PCV. A positive response was defined as a ≥2-fold increase (from baseline to day 60) in capsule-specific immunoglobulin G, with a postvaccination level ≥1000 ng/mL for at least 2 of the 4 serotypes. Results. HIV-infected persons demonstrated a higher frequency of positive antibody responses to PCV than to PPV (57% vs 36%) (P=.004) and greater mean changes in the immunoglobulin G concentration from baseline to day 60 for serotypes 4, 9V, and 19F (P<.05, for all), but not for serotype 14. However, by day 180, both outcomes were similar. Responses to PCV were greater in frequency and magnitude for all serotypes in HIV-uninfected adults, compared with those in HIV-infected adults. Conclusions. Among persons with HIV infection, revaccination with PCV was only transiently more immunogenic than PPV, and responses were inferior to those in HIV-uninfected subjects with primary vaccination. Pneumococcal vaccines with more robust and sustained immunogenicity are needed for HIV-infected adults. Clinical trial registration.

370,370,Successful treatment of multiple sinus thromboses and meningitis due to aspergilli and α-streptococci with preemptive antimycotic therapy: A case report,"A 62-year-old immunocompetent woman presented with 11 days of headache, 2 days of right eye ache and 1 day of fever and lethargy. Neurological examination revealed nuchal stiffness, right proptosis, bilateral ptosis, and right abducens palsy.

Purulent meningitis and multiple mycotic cerebral venous sinus thromboses were diagnosed. After empirical therapy with meropenem, fever persisted and CSF cell count further elevated (668/ μl on day 3). Additional treatment with liposomal amphotericin B (L-AMB) and low-dose heparin from day 3 ameliorated her symptoms and lowered her CSF cell count.

371,371,Pneumococcal disease in critically ill adults in the 7-valent vaccine ERA,"INTRODUCTION. In Spain, 7-valent conjugated pneumococcal vaccine (PCV7) was introduced in 2001. Several studies have shown a decrease in the pneumococcal disease (PD) in children. The effect on adults is still not well known. OBJECTIVE. to determine if there is a change in the incidence, complications and severity of the PD after the introduction of the 7-valent conjugated vaccine. METHODS. Observational study of patients with PD admitted to an Intensive Care Unit of a teaching hospital. The period of the study was from January 2000 until December 2009. Epidemiological data, clinical course, complications and mortality rate were obtained from hospital's records. Statistical tests: Chi-square, Fisher test, Student's t, U Mann-Whitney and logistic regression analysis. RESULTS. 163 patients from the 8,548 total admissions at ICU during that period of time were studied. 62% were men, mean age 54.54 (16.85-82.90) years. Diagnose was performed by 2 or more methods in 47.9%, blood cultures in 20.5%, urinary antigen testing in 12.2%, pleural fluid in 1.3%, sputum in 9% and cerebrospinal fluid in 7.1%. APACHE-III at admittance was 67 (12-188). Comorbidities were present in 77.3% of the patients. The cause of admittance was meningitis in 23.9% and pneumonia in 74.2%. Patients affected with meningitis were older (p = 0.004) than those affected with pneumonia. During these years, the PD has shown a statistically significant increase (p = 0.0043) in the number of patients admitted and the in cases of pneumonia while the number of pneumococcal meningitis remained stable. Pleural effusion was developed by 21.2% of the patients. Mechanical ventilation was necessary in 59.7% of patients with pneumonia and 73.7% in patients affected with meningitis. Worst GCS at UCI in patients with meningitis was 7 (3-15). ICU length of stay was 8 (1-109) days. Mortality rate in patients with meningitis and pneumonia was 28.2 and 22.7% respectively (NS). The respiratory (38.4 vs. 1.7% p<0.001) and renal failures (38.9 vs. 11.6% p<0.0001) were significantly associated with a higher mortality. Neurological sequelae after meningitis were observed in 58.1% of the patients. The main risk factors associated with mortality were age (OR 1,071 95% CI: 1,017-1,127), solid neoplasia (OR 6,307 CI 95%: 1,022-38,904) and chronic hepatopathy (OR 3,211 95% CI: 1,144-9,014).

372,372,Do children infected with HIV receiving HAART need to be revaccinated?,"No official recommendations have been made on whether children infected with HIV on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) should be revaccinated. We reviewed published work to establish whether these children have protective immunity to vaccine-preventable diseases and to assess short-term and long-term immune responses to vaccination of children given HAART. In general, children on HAART had low levels of immunity to vaccines given before treatment. Most children on HAART, however, responded to revaccination, although immune reconstitution was not sufficient to ensure long-term immunity for some children. These results suggest that children on HAART would benefit from revaccination, but levels of protective immunity might need to be monitored and some children might need additional vaccine doses to maintain protective immunity.

We compared the originally licensed regimen to 2 widely used alternative regimens. Methods: Five hundred forty-three infants were randomized to receive PCV7 at 2, 4, 6, and 12 months (3 + 1), at 4, 6, and 12 months (2 + 1), or at 2, 4, and 6 months (3 + 0). Blood was drawn at 2, 7, 13, and 19 months. Serotype-specific IgG concentrations were determined by ELISA. Results: In the 2 + 1 group, postprimary IgG concentrations against serotypes 6B, 14, 18C, and 23F were reduced compared with the 3 + 1 or 3 + 0 groups. Both 3 + 1 and 2 + 1 groups showed marked booster response, but the 2 + 1 group had reduced concentrations against serotypes 6B, 18C, 23F. At 19 months, IgG antibodies decreased in both 3 + 1 and 2 + 1 groups but the 2 + 1 group had significantly lower concentrations against serotypes 6B, 18C, and 23F.

377,377,Recurrent abscesses,"Introduction: Hiper IgE Syndrome (HIES) is a rare primary immunodeficiency, characterized by elevated total serum IgE (>2000 kU/l), usually associated with different combinations of clinical features including cutaneous and respiratory infections (most frequently caused by Staphylococcus aureus), distinctive facies, musculoskeletal abnormalities and retain of primary teeth. Autosomic dominant (AD) and recessive forms have been described. Case Report: We present a 16 year-old Caucasian boy, referred to our outpatient clinic due to recurrent cutaneous and profound abscesses since the age of four, caused by S. aureus, with poor response to antibiotics and requiring surgical draining in several episodes (right axillary lymphadenitis at 4 and 6 years old; left inguinal lymphadenitis and right kidney at 15; abdominal and retroperitoneal abscess at 16). Past clinical history included a generalized impetigo at 6 months old without fever, pneumococcal meningitis at 13 years old and retain of primary teeth. The patient presented a broad nasal bridge, prominent forehead, rough facial skin and hyperextensibility of joints. Laboratory findings included mild eosinophilia (590 eosinophils/μl) and elevated total serum IgE>5000 kU/l, with normal IgG, IgA and IgM. IL17 producing T cells were low, with no major alterations of the remaining lymphocyte subpopulations. Proliferative lymphocytic responses to Candida albicans and PPD were absent. Neutrophyls phagocytic and oxidative capacities were maintained, as were specific antibodies responses to protein and poly-saccharide vaccines. In October 2008 he was admitted due to an extensive retroperitoneal and pelvic abscess. S aureus was isolated. Percutaneous drainage and intravenous flucloxacilin were started, with favorable evolution. Since he was released, he maintains prophylactic therapy with cotrimoxazol, without infections since. Conclusion: HIES should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with frequent skin infections, with poor inflammatory signs and high total serum IgE.

InL presents as a complex of hypo-albuminemia, hypogammaglobulinemia and lymphopenia with clinical manifestations of humoral and cellular immunodeficiency. Due to accelerated elimination of immunoglobulins, protective serum IgG levels cannot be maintained by intravenous replacement (IVIg). We report a case of InL that was successfully managed with SCIg and octreotide, which substantially reduced his GI protein losses and SCIg dose by >50%. Methods: We report the case of a 50 year-old man with recurrent sinopulmonary infections, long standing chronic diarrhea and palmar warts. Clinical features, laboratory, radiographic, and histopathologic results that led to his diagnosis are presented and the literature on InL is reviewed using PubMed, Medline and Google search engines. Results: Low albumin, total protein, IgG ranging 252 to 295 (564-1765 mg/dl) and IgM 34-40 (45-250) were noted, but IgA was normal. Lymphopenia was present at 0.7-1.4 (1.2-4.9 × 109/mcl) with CD3+307-534 (1000-2500), CD4+57-154 (550-1300), CD8+215-393 (250-900), and CD19+139-519 (90-400). Antibody response to tetanus and pneumococcal vaccines was adequate, however, protective titers were rapidly lost. Delayed responses to Candida and tetanus were intact and PPD was non-reactive. Fecal excretion of alpha1-antitrypsin was elevated. Gastrodu-odenoscopy and biopsy confirmed InL. Capsule endoscopy revealed diffuse involvement of the entire small intestine. Initially, suppressive antibiotic therapy prevented recurrence of respiratory infections; however, after 2 years the frequency of infections increased. SCIg with Vivaglobin 16% was initiated and his IgG level stabilized at 13 ml (2.08 g) every other day (qod). Octreotide was started that resolved most of his abdominal symptoms and lower extremity edema. It normalized his albumin and reduced SCIg requirement to 6 ml (0.92 g) qod. Conclusion: InL should be suspected in a patient with recurrent respiratory infections and chronic diarrhea, especially if diffuse cutaneous warts are present along with lymphopenia and low serum albumin, IgG and IgM.

379,379,"The aetiology, clinical presentations and outcome of febrile encephalopathy in children in Papua New Guinea","Background: Febrile encephalopathy, defined as fever, seizures and/or altered consciousness, is a common presentation in children in tropical developing countries. Outcomes range from complete recovery through varying degrees of neurological disability which slowly resolve or remain permanent to death from either the acute illness or complications. Whilst bacterial meningitis accounts for a proportion of children affected, the aetiology in many remains unclear but includes malaria and probably viral encephalitis. Aim: To understand the aetiology, presentation and outcome of febrile encephalopathy in children in Papua New Guinea. Methods: Children aged between 1 month and 12 years presenting to Port Moresby General Hospital with febrile encephalopathy were studied prospectively. A detailed history and examination and the following laboratory investigations were undertaken as appropriate: cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) microscopy and bacterial culture, gram stain, measurement of protein and glucose and latex agglutination testing for Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Neisseria meningitides; Ziehl-Neelsen staining and india ink examination on selected samples; IgM for Japanese encephalitis, dengue, rubella and measles; PCR testing and mycobacterial culture for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Blood was tested for flavivirus, measles and rubella IgM and IgG. Results: 149 children were enrolled in the study. 129 had a lumbar puncture and CSF examination; 66 had a normal CSF white cell count. A clinical or laboratory-based diagnosis was possible for 140 children, but a definite pathogen was identifiable for only 55 (37%). The diagnoses included bacterial meningitis in 33 (S. pneumonia 16, H. influenza 13 and N. meningitides 4), tuberculous meningitis (5), probable tuberculous meningitis (18), malaria (10), cryptococcal meningitis (1), flavivirus encephalitis (5), rubella encephalitis (1), hepatic encephalopathy (1) and HIV encephalopathy (1). There were 28 cases of meningitis of unspecified aetiology. Of the five children with IgM-confirmed flavivirus encephalitis, one had dengue serotype 1 and two had Japanese encephalitis. Twenty-five children (including three of the five children with CSF flavivirus IgM) had serological IgG evidence of previous flavivirus infection. A history of multiple convulsions, the presence of neck stiffness and use of the Glasgow coma score (GCS) and TB score chart helped to identify children with bacterial meningitis and an adverse outcome and those with febrile convulsions. Conclusion: The study confirms the importance of S. pneumonia and H. influenza as major causes of febrile encephalopathy in children in Papua New Guinea. Flaviviruses including Japanese encephalitis are a cause of the febrile encephalopathy syndrome, as is Mycobacterium tuberculosis. All children with febrile encephalopathy should have their GCS and TB scores recorded and should be examined for neck stiffness, and a history of the frequency of convulsions should be recorded.

Objective: To evaluate the effect of IL-12/23 inhibition on immunocompetency by antigen-recall response in a preclinical multipledose toxicology study and three single-dose, phase 1 studies. Methods: Cynomolgus monkeys (Mauritius; n=32) treated with subcutaneous (s.c.) placebo or ustekinumab 22.5 or 45 mg/kg twice weekly for 26 weeks were assessed for antibody responsiveness to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH).

Because of the accelerated elimination of immunoglobulins, protective serum IgG levels cannot be maintained by intravenous replacement (IVIg). We report a case of InL that was successfully managed with SCIg and octreotide that was added to his regimen. It substantially reduced his GI protein losses and decreased his SCIg dose requirements by over 50%. We report the case of a 50-year-old man with recurrent bronchitis, sinusitis and pneumonia, long-standing chronic diarrhea, and palmar warts. Clinical features, laboratory, radiographic, and histopathologic results that led to his diagnosis are presented, and the literature on treatment options for InL is reviewed using PubMed, Medline, and Google search engines. Low albumin, total protein, IgG ranging from 252 to 295 (564-1765 mg/dl) and IgM 34-40 (45-250 mg/dl) were noted, but IgA was normal.

Antibody response to tetanus and pneumococcal vaccines was adequate; however, protective titers were rapidly lost. Delayed responses to Candida and tetanus were intact and PPD was non-reactive. Fecal excretion of alpha1-antitrypsin was elevated. Gastroduodenoscopy and biopsy confirmed InL. Capsule endoscopy revealed diffuse involvement of the entire small intestine. Initially, suppressive antibiotic therapy prevented recurrence of respiratory infections; however, after 2 years, the frequency of infections increased. SCIg with Vivaglobin 16% was initiated and his IgG level stabilized at 13 ml (2.08 g) every other day (qod). Octreotide was started that resolved most of his abdominal symptoms and lower extremity edema. It normalized his albumin and reduced SCIg requirement to 6 ml (0.92 g) qod. InL should be suspected in a patient with recurrent respiratory infections and chronic diarrhea, especially if diffuse cutaneous warts are present along with lymphopenia and low serum albumin, IgG and IgM.

385,385,Immunogenicity of a reduced schedule of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in healthy infants and correlates of protection for serotype 6B in the united kingdom,"BACKGROUND: Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) was introduced in the United Kingdom immunization schedule in September 2006. This study was conducted to establish the immunogenicity of licensed PCV (Prevenar) at a reduced, 2 priming dose schedule (2+1) and to evaluate functional responses in the context of vaccine effectiveness. METHODS: Infants were randomized to receive PCV at 2 and 3 months or 2 and 4 months of age. Boosters were administered at the same time as Haemophilus influenzae type B/meningococcal C conjugate and Measles, Mumps and Rubella or with Measles, Mumps and Rubella alone (www.ClinicalTrials. gov NCT00197808). RESULTS: PCV at 2/3 months of age was poorly immunogenic and recruitment to this arm was terminated. PCV at 2/4 months of age resulted in lower than expected responses to serotypes 6B and 23F. Functional analysis of serotype 6B by OPA revealed that an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay cutoff of 0.2 μg/mL was a better predictor of OPA positivity than a cut off of 0.35 μg/mL. PCV booster responses were excellent and no interference from concomitant vaccines was noted. CONCLUSIONS: An interval of at least 8 weeks is required when starting PCV vaccination at 2 months of age although not all serotypes are equally immunogenic.

386,386,"Streptococcus suis, an emerging zoonotic agent of meningitis, triggers different inflammatory signalling pathways by murine microglia","Objective: Streptococcus suis type 2 is an important swine and human pathogen responsible for septicaemia and meningitis. We demonstrated that in the brain of infected mice with S. suis, microglia expressed increased levels of different pro-inflammatory genes. To expand our knowledge of the interactions between S. suis and microglia, we evaluated the signalling pathways underlying S. suis-induced proinflammatory events. Methods: Mouse microglia line BV-2 was infected with a virulent wild type (WT) strain of S. suis or a panel of mutants altered at the capsule (CPS-mutant) or cell wall levels. Phagocytosis was quantified by an antibiotic protection assay. Cell supernatants were used to measure pro-inflammatory cytokines by ELISA and nitric oxide (NO) by the Griess reaction. Analysis from cell lysates, to evaluate inflammation-associated intracellular signalization pathways, was carried out by western blot using specific antibodies against iNOS, p-PKC, p-Tyr and mitogen-activated proteine kinase (MAPK) members p-JNK, p-ERK 1/2 and p-p38. Specific inhibitors of MAPK were used to confirm their participation in cytokine production. The involvement of the inflammatory transcription factor NF-kB was monitored by EMSA. Results: Phagocytosis and cytokine studies showed that the CPS was the only relevant virulence factor modulating bacterial interactions with microglia. The CPS helped bacteria to resist phagocytosis and regulate the inflammatory response as it hides pro-inflammatory components from the bacterial cell wall. S. suis induced iNOS expression and further NO production from microglia. Cells infected with the CPS-mutant showed stronger phosphorylation profiles for PKC, Tyr and MAPK. Likewise, pharmacologic inhibition of MAPK abrogated TNF-a and MCP-1 production from infected cells. Finally, S. suis-induced NF- kB translocation was faster for cells stimulated with the CPS-mutant, suggesting that bacterial cell wall components are potent inducers of NF-kB. Conclusions: Our data help to better understand the mechanisms underlying S. suis induction of inflammation in the brain, that in time would be useful to design more efficient anti-inflammatory strategies for meningitis.",FALSE,"Streptococcus suis, an emerging zoonotic agent of meningitis, triggers different inflammatory signalling pathways by murine microgliaObjective: Streptococcus suis type 2 is an important swine and human pathogen responsible for septicaemia and meningitis.

387,387,Pneumococcal infections as a sudden death cause: Forensic microbiological diagnosis,"Objectives: Pneumococcal infection (PI) is a main cause of community- acquired pneumonia (CAP) and meningitis in adults, sometimes leading to a fatal outcome. The incidence of PI as responsible of sudden unexpected death (SUD) has not been established to date. Since SUD usually occurs outside of the hospital or soon after arrival in the emergency department, in most occasions a microbiological analysis is not performed at the hospital and a medico-legal autopsy is performed. The aim of this study was to determine the incidence of PI as a cause of SUD and to assess the utility of different techniques to detect this pathogen in forensic postmortem samples. Methods: Specimens were received from the different Forensic Pathology Services all along Spain. We designed a flexible protocol including: (i) detection of capsular pneumococcal antigen by latex agglutination and immunocromatography, (ii) bacteriological culture of forensic samples, and (iii) detection of pneumococcal DNA by PCR (ply, lytA and psa genes). Antigenic detection was always considered a presumptive result. A positive result for a sample was defined when a pneumococcus had been isolated by culture and/or when a positive real time PCR result was obtained from a sterile fluid or tissue. Results: We analyzed 377 SUD (255 in adults and 122 in infants) (age range 19 days-90 years) and 1971 samples. In 46 SUD cases a pneumococcus was detected, 36 in adults (age range 19-74) and 7 in infants (4-16months) (16 females and 30 males). The cause of death was directly attributed to pneumococcus in 44 of them according to histopathology. Concomitant diseases were present at least in 32 ofthem. One infant SUD had co-infection with the H1N1 virus. Other pathogens were detected in 8 cases. In 38.3% of the positive cases the diagnosis of PI was made by culture.

In a 36.2% only the PCR assay permitted the detection of pneumococcus and, in 35.3% out of them, the only specimen where a positive PCR result was obtained was a paraffin- embedded tissue. Conclusion: Pneumococcus is a pathogen involved in sudden death, mainly due to meningitis (52.2%), CAP (28.3%) and Waterhouse- Friederichen syndrome (15.2%).

It aims to describe the incidence of IPD and the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of cases in HPHM. Methods: IPD cases were defined by isolation of S. pneumoniae from a normally sterile site. Data recorded for each isolate were age, gender, diagnosis and isolate type. Diagnosis was classified as bacteraemia, meningitis, pneumonia or empyema. S. pneumoniae cases were serotyped in a reference laboratory, using the Quellung reaction with serotype- specific antiserum and latex agglutination test (Pneumolatex). The HPHM is a 613-bed hospital and covers a population of approximately 5 hundred thousand people. The incidence of IPD was assessed using estimates of population from the Office for Local Statistics. Isolates from children < 5 years were collected since October 2008. (Table persented). Results: A total of 95 strains were isolated between February 2007 and November 2009. 55 were men (58%). The overall IPD incidence in the HPHM population was 6.2 cases per 100,000 per annum [95% confidence interval (CI) 4.3-8.6]. The incidence in children under five was 23 [95% CI 10.2-46.3]. The incidence of serotypes included in the vaccine PPV23 (83%) was 5.1 [3.4-7.3]. A seasonal pattern of disease was observed. Twenty-eight serotypes were isolated in total, five different serotypes were found in the under fives (8 isolates), twenty-two in the over 65 age group (35 isolates) and twenty-two in the 5-65 age group (52 isolates). Most common serotypes in the general population were 1 (18 isolates), 3 (13 isolates), 5 (8 isolates), 4 (5 isolates), 8 (5 isolates), 19A (5 isolates), 11A (4 isolates) and 18C (4 isolates), compromising 62% of the total isolate collection.

389,389,Evaluation of Streptococcus agalactiae positive newborn cases,"Objectives: Streptococcus agalactiae (Group B Streptococcus - GBS) emerged as the leading infectious cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality. These bacteria can colonise the vagina of women without any infectious symptom. Infants can become infected with GBS during passage through the birth canal, although the majority of infants who are exposed to GBS during labour become colonized on skin or mucous membranes but remain asymptomatic. Our objective was to evaluate the GBS positivity among newborns. Methods: The nasopharynx and stomach fluid surveillance samples of newborns admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit during 2007 and 2008 were cultured. We also used latex agglutination test (Pastorex Meningitis StreptoB, BioRad, Hercules, California US) for the detection of GBS antigen in urine and cerebrospinal fluid of newborns. Inflammatory parameters (C reactive protein, white blood cells and thrombocyte count) were used to confirm the presence of GBS infection. The vaginal samples of the GBS positive newborns' mothers were also analysed. The vaginal fluids of the pregnant women were cultured between the 35 and 37 gestational week according to CDC recommendations. Results: Newborns in whom both the antigen test and the surveillance culture were positive for GBS all showed infectious signs (9 cases). Newborns with positive GBS latex urine samples only, had symptoms of infection in 44% (28 out of 63 cases), while those with only positive GBS surveillance cultures had clinical signs of infection in 38%. Vaginal culturing was performed in 51% of the affected women with 24% positivity rate (41/10). All GBS positive mothers received antibiotic prophylaxis during delivery. In the other 24 cases antibiotic was administered after the risk assessment for GBS infection. Conclusion: The indication of antibiotic prophylaxis - for avoiding development of GBS caused infection in newborns - is based on risk-assessment or positive culturing.

391,391,Purification and characterization of an anti-pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide IgG antibody preparation,"Objectives: Streptococcus pneumoniae is a major human pathogen causing pneumonia, sepsis, meningitis and otitis media. The major virulence factor of S. pneumoniae is the capsular polysaccharide (PS), of which there are 90 different types each inducing their own serotype specific antibodies. Since anti-PS antibodies are highly protective, efforts have focused on using the PS as immunogens for the development of pneumococcal vaccines. Standardisation of quantitative PS antibody measurement is of utmost importance between different laboratories. The objective of the study was to purify specific anti-PS IgG antibodies against the 23-valent PNEUMOVAX™ vaccine (Merck and Co. Inc). Methods: Pooled plasma from multiple donors (6 to 10) were clotted. Three independent pools were prepared. Total IgG was purified using ammonium sulphate precipitation and anion-exchange chromatography. Following adsorption of contaminating non-specific PS, pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide(PCP)-specific antibodies were obtained by affinity purification using PNEUMOVAX™ covalently linked to Sepharose. The purified PCP specific IgG was characterised for purity, serotype composition, function, and then quantified. Results: SDS-PAGE analysis suggested that the purified PCP specific IgG was at least 95% pure. Functionally, the preparation contained no contaminating Haemophilus influenzae type b, diphtheria toxoid or tetanus toxoid or contaminating non-specific PS antibodies. The major IgG subclasses in the preparation were IgG2 > IgG1 with negligible levels of IgG3 and IgG4. Immunoglobulin classes IgA and IgM were absent. Serotype analysis indicated that this preparation reacted with all 23 serotypes present in the PNEUMOVAX™ vaccine. Conclusion: Determination of accurate antibody titre is essential for serodiagnosis, epidemiological investigation and evaluation of vaccine response.

Later that day, the patient noticed a rash over her entire body, which is reddish/purple, nontender, and nonpruritic. She denied weight loss, chest pain, fever, headache, and neck stiffness. She had no known allergies, history of bleeding disorder, recent dental interventions, recent travel, new sexual encounters, vaginal discharge, oral or genital ulcers, or evidence of urethritis. Physical exam showed a low-grade fever and tachycardia with nonblanching petechial and purpuric red to violet lesions on all extremities, the chest and the palate. The patient was in no acute distress. No lymphadenopathy or organomegaly were palpated, and the neck was supple. WBC was 13,0007/μ With 89% granulocytes.

Several studies have examined antibody responses to pertussis vaccines at birth but no previous study has evaluated 2 doses of monovalent acellular pertussis vaccine (aPV) before 2 months of age. Methods: Seventy-six newborns were randomized at birth to 3 groups-aPV at birth and 1 month, aPV at birth, and control. All infants received hepatitis B vaccine (HBV) at birth followed at 2, 4, and 6 months by a combination vaccine including aPV, diphtheria, tetanus, Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), hepatitis B, polio antigens and 7 valent conjugate pneumococcal vaccine. IgG antibody responses to pertussis toxoid (PT), filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA), and pertactin (PRN) were measured in maternal serum and in infants at 2, 4, 6, and 8 months of age. Antibody responses to hepatitis B, diphtheria, tetanus, and Hib were measured at 8 months only. A parental diary and active telephone follow-up occurred for 7 days after each vaccination. Results: The aPV birth dose was well tolerated. By 2 months of age, 22 of 25 (88%) of 2 dose recipients had detectable IgG antibody to PT (IgG PT) compared with 9 of 21 (43%) who received a birth dose only and 3 of 20 (15%) of controls. Infants in the 2 dose group had a geometric mean concentration (GMC) of IgG PT of 16 ELISA units per mL (EU/mL), 95% CI: 11 to 25, significantly higher than birth dose only (5 EU/mL, 95% CI: 3-8) and controls (3 EU/mL, 95% CI: 2-5). At 8 months of age, following 5, 4, and 3 doses of aP-containing vaccine, respectively, IgG PT had plateaued but IgG to FHA and PRN increased with successive doses. There was a trend to lower antibody responses for hepatitis B and Hib with higher numbers of Pa doses. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that aPV at birth and 1 month induces significantly higher IgG antibody against pertussis antigens by 2 months of age without reducing subsequent pertussis antibody responses. Larger and more detailed studies of aPV from birth are needed to evaluate other antibody responses and the potential of this approach to reduce death and morbidity from Bordetella pertussis infection in the first 3 months of life. © 2010 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.",FALSE,"Acellular pertussis vaccine at birth and one month induces antibody responses by two months of ageBackground: Infants less than 3 months of age are at highest risk of hospitalization and death from pertussis.

All infants received hepatitis B vaccine (HBV) at birth followed at 2, 4, and 6 months by a combination vaccine including aPV, diphtheria, tetanus, Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), hepatitis B, polio antigens and 7 valent conjugate pneumococcal vaccine. IgG antibody responses to pertussis toxoid (PT), filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA), and pertactin (PRN) were measured in maternal serum and in infants at 2, 4, 6, and 8 months of age. Antibody responses to hepatitis B, diphtheria, tetanus, and Hib were measured at 8 months only. A parental diary and active telephone follow-up occurred for 7 days after each vaccination. Results: The aPV birth dose was well tolerated. By 2 months of age, 22 of 25 (88%) of 2 dose recipients had detectable IgG antibody to PT (IgG PT) compared with 9 of 21 (43%) who received a birth dose only and 3 of 20 (15%) of controls. Infants in the 2 dose group had a geometric mean concentration (GMC) of IgG PT of 16 ELISA units per mL (EU/mL), 95% CI: 11 to 25, significantly higher than birth dose only (5 EU/mL, 95% CI: 3-8) and controls (3 EU/mL, 95% CI: 2-5). At 8 months of age, following 5, 4, and 3 doses of aP-containing vaccine, respectively, IgG PT had plateaued but IgG to FHA and PRN increased with successive doses. There was a trend to lower antibody responses for hepatitis B and Hib with higher numbers of Pa doses. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that aPV at birth and 1 month induces significantly higher IgG antibody against pertussis antigens by 2 months of age without reducing subsequent pertussis antibody responses. Larger and more detailed studies of aPV from birth are needed to evaluate other antibody responses and the potential of this approach to reduce death and morbidity from Bordetella pertussis infection in the first 3 months of life. © 2010 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.",FALSE,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 397}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 397}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 397}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 397}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 397}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 397}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 397}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 397}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 397}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 397}",1

Methods: The phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 76-wk BLISS-76 study evaluated the efficacy and safety of belimumab 1 or 10 mg/kg (IV infusion over 1 h on d 0, 14, and 28, and every 28 d thereafter through 72 wk) plus SOC vs placebo plus SOC in patients with seropositive SLE (ANA >=1:80 and/or anti-dsDNA >=30 IU/mL; NCT00410384). History of receiving pneumococcal, tetanus, and influenza vaccines was obtained at screening. Patients receiving a pneumococcal (n=73) or tetanus (n=81) vaccine within 5 y prior to d 0, or an influenza vaccine (n=146) within 1 y prior to d 0, were tested for vaccine antibody levels on d 0 and at wk 52. Immunoglobulin-G antibodies were measured for each vaccine (multi-analyte immune detection for pneumonia, enzymelinked immunosorbent assay for tetanus, and hemagglutination inhibition test for influenza). Endpoints used to determine the impact of belimumab on vaccine responses included % change in antibody levels from baseline to wk 52 in patients with pre-existing antibodies, and proportion of patients with protective antibodies at baseline who maintained protective levels at wk 52. Results: Consistent with the preservation of the memory B-cell compartment (CD20+/27+ B cells), belimumab did not cause a statistically significant decrease in pre-existing antibodies to pneumococcal and tetanus vaccines; most patients were able to maintain protective titers to these vaccines, and changes were similar across treatment groups (table). Pre-existing antibody responses to seasonal influenza vaccines were generally not affected by treatment with belimumab, although a statistical, but not clinically relevant, difference (<1-fold median change in titers) between treatment groups was observed for some antigens; the percentages of patients that maintained protective specific titers at the end of 52 wk were similar in the belimumab and placebo treatment groups.

The vaccination with capsular polysaccharides (PS) is ineffective in toddlers and young infants, due to the T-independent nature of these antigens. The success of conjugated vaccines against Neumococco is due to PS are become immunogenic for these groups of risk, because they are processed as T-dependent antigen by immune system. Currently, the Center for Biomolecular Chemistry is working on develops an heptavalent conjugated vaccine against Neumococco. Frequently, aluminum adjuvants are included on vaccine formulations to improve the immunogenicity of antigens. Herein, the effects of aluminum phosphate (AlPO4) adjuvant on the immunogenicity of two monovalent conjugates against serotypes 1 and 14 were evaluated. Materials and Methods: Balb/c mice were immunized with three doses s.c of conjugates 1-TT or 14-TT (2 g PS/dose) with and without AlPO4 adjuvant. The serum and mucosal antibody response and the antibody avidity were evaluated by ELISA. Results and Discussion: An improvement of the immunogenicity was found when both conjugates were adjuvated, and the effects were better for serotype 14 than 1.

410,410,IL-1β release during meningitis: Synergy of TLR and NLR stimulation,"Meningitis is a life-threatening disease mainly caused by bacteria and viruses. Bacterial components such as Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), lipoproteins or peptidoglycan breakdown products (i.e. MDP, mesoDAP) stimulate pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and the intracellular Nod-like receptors (NLRs) for an inflammatory response. We hypothesize that a synergistic effect of TLR-induced NF-xB activation and NLR-mediated caspase-1 induction leads to an increased release of mature IL-1β during bacterial meningitis in brain-derived cells. A mouse meningitis model with S. pneumoniae (D39) was established for assessing IL-1β induction during this disease. The murine RAW264.7 cell line, the human astroglial U-87 MG and the murine microglial cell-line BV-2 were stimulated with the TLR4 ligand LPS, the TLR2 ligand Pam2Cys, the Nod2 ligand MDP, or the Nod1 ligand C12-iE-DAP, and, as control, ATP alone or in combination. We assessed IL-1β by ELISA and caspase-1 and pro-IL-1β expression by Western Blot. Furthermore, primary mouse astrocytes isolated from the cortices of mouse puppies were used for stimulation followed by siRNA suppression of elements of the IL-1β induction pathway. S. pneumoniae (D39) infected mice showed a significant increase in IL-1β release after 24 hours. In vitro, an increase in IL-1β levels after costimulation with LPS or Pam2Cys, and MDP or C12-iE-DAP was observed in a dose-dependent manner. A synergistic enhancement of IL-1β by TLR- and NLR-ligands was observed in RAW cells, BV-2 cells, U-87 cells and primary astrocytes. Active caspase-1 (p10) was induced by MDP or C12-iE-DAP, corresponding with high IL-1β responses when LPS or Pam2Cys was added. SiRNA experiments show that a knock-down of Nod2 leads to a diminished IL-1β release after LPS- and MDP-stimulation. The precursor forms of IL-1β and caspase-1 seem to be constitutively expressed in astrocytes and microglia. A synergistic enhancement between TLRs and NLRs in IL-1β release in brain-derived cells was observed. So a two-step stimulation seems necessary for the release of high levels of mature IL-1β by astrocytes and microglia.

412,412,Bacterial isolates from cerebro-spinal fluid at Bacteriology Laboratory of Institute for Infectious and Tropical Diseases of Clinical Center of Serbia in the period 2001-2008,"INTRODUCTION Bacterial infections of central nervous system (CNS) are life threatening diseases. Their frequency and distribution differ depending on immunization, socio-economical status, hygiene, age and other epidemiologic parameters. They can be focal, to be extended to meninges, or all brain structures. They can appear spontaneously or post-traumatically. The most frequent bacterial causes are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae type b and Escherichia coli. OBJECTIVES To analyze the frequency of bacterial causes of CNS infections, isolated at Bacteriology Laboratory of Institute for Infectious and Tropical Diseases of Clinical Center of Serbia in period 2001-2008. MATERIALS AND METHODS The retrospective study was conducted to analyze the rates of isolation of causative agents from cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF) of patients residing at Institute for Infectious and Tropical Diseases and five more Institutes of Clinical Center of Serbia. CSF has been examined by standard procedure (Gram stain and methylene staining of direct smears, cultivation on blood and chocolate agar and brain heart infusion broth).

Their frequency and distribution differ depending on immunization, socio-economical status, hygiene, age and other epidemiologic parameters. They can be focal, to be extended to meninges, or all brain structures. They can appear spontaneously or post-traumatically. The most frequent bacterial causes are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae type b and Escherichia coli. OBJECTIVES To analyze the frequency of bacterial causes of CNS infections, isolated at Bacteriology Laboratory of Institute for Infectious and Tropical Diseases of Clinical Center of Serbia in period 2001-2008. MATERIALS AND METHODS The retrospective study was conducted to analyze the rates of isolation of causative agents from cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF) of patients residing at Institute for Infectious and Tropical Diseases and five more Institutes of Clinical Center of Serbia. CSF has been examined by standard procedure (Gram stain and methylene staining of direct smears, cultivation on blood and chocolate agar and brain heart infusion broth). In some specimes detection of antigens of most frequent bacterial causes of CNS infections has been performed by latex agglutination. RESULTS Out of 3247 CSF that have been processed, bacterial cause has been isolated in 393 (12.10%).

Bacterial meningitis in childhood is almost exclusively caused by the respiratory tract pathogens Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Haemophilus influenzae, but the mechanism by which they initiate contact with the vascular endothelium of the blood brain barrier (BBB) is unknown. We hypothesized that an interaction with LR might underlie their CNS tropism.

Mutagenesis studies indicated that the corresponding bacterial LR-binding adhesins were pneumococcal CbpA, meningococcal PilQ and PorA, and OmpP2 of H. influenzae. The results of competitive binding experiments suggest that a common adhesin recognition site is present in the carboxyl terminus of LR.

Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV) have demonstrated efficacy against childhood invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) and pneumonia in the United States and Africa. No information is available from Asia on the impact of PCV on childhood pneumonia. METHODS: We conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial in Bohol, the Philippines (ISRCTN 62323832). Children 6 weeks to <6 months of age were randomly allocated to receive 3 doses of either an 11-valent PCV (11PCV, sanofi pasteur, Lyon, France) or a saline placebo, with a minimum interval of 4 weeks between doses to determine vaccine efficacy (VE) against the primary outcome of a child experiencing first episode of community-acquired radiologically defined pneumonia in the first 2 years of life. Secondary end points were clinical pneumonia, IPD, safety, and immunogenicity. RESULTS: Twelve thousand one hundred ninety-one children were enrolled. By per protocol (PP) analysis, 93 of 6013 fully vaccinated 11PCV recipient children had a first episode of radiologic pneumonia compared with 120 of 6018 placebo recipients. VE against radiologically defined pneumonia for the PP cohort of children 3 to 23 months old was 22.9% (95% CI: -1.1, 41.2; P = 0.06), for the prespecified subgroups of children 3 to 11 months of age, 34.0% (95% CI: 4.8, 54.3; P = 0.02), and of those 12 to 23 months old, 2.7% (95% CI: -43.5, 34.0; P = 0.88). By intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis, 119 of 6097 11PCV recipient children had an episode of radiologic pneumonia compared with 141 of 6094 placebo recipients. VE against radiologic pneumonia for the ITT cohort of children <2 years old was 16.0% (95% CI -7.3, 34.2; P = 0.16), for a subgroup of children <12 months of age, 19.8% (95% CI: -8.8, 40.8; P = 0.15). VE against clinical pneumonia by PP was not significant (VE 0.1%; 95% CI -9.4, 8.7; P = 0.99). IPD was rare: only 3 cases of IPD due to vaccine serotypes were observed during the study. 11PCV was immunogenic and well tolerated. Among 11PCV recipients, a small excess of serious adverse respiratory events was observed in the first 28 days after the first and second dose of vaccine, and of nonrespiratory events after the first dose. An excess of pneumonia episodes in 11PCV recipients in the month following the second dose of vaccination was the principal reason for lower VE by ITT analysis than by PP analysis. CONCLUSIONS: In PP analysis, a 22.9% reduction of community-acquired radiologically confirmed pneumonia in children younger than 2 years of age in the 11-valent tetanus-diphtheria toxoid-conjugated PCV vaccinated group was observed; a reduction similar as observed in other PCV trials. We could not demonstrate any VE against clinical pneumonia. Our finding confirms for the first time that in a low-income, low-mortality developing country in Asia, at least one-fifth of radiologically confirmed pneumonia is caused by pneumococcus, and thus preventable by PCV.

In this phase II study (CA184004), humoral and cellular responses were assessed in ipilimumab-treated pts with unresectable stage III/IV melanoma. Methods: Ipilimumab 3 or 10 mg/kg was given every 3 weeks x 4. Tetanus boosters were given 10 days pre-treatment. Influenza and pneumococcal vaccines were given 5 days after first ipilimumab dose. Tetanus, anti-influenza, and anti-pneumococcal Ab levels were assessed at pre-dose and Wk 7. Humoral response to 5 tumor antigens (Ag) and a control Ag (DHFR) were examined at baseline (BL) and at Wks 4, 8-9, and 12. DTH skin tests were given at pre-dose and Wk 4, with responses recorded 15 minutes (min) and 24-72 hours (hrs) post-test.

Methods: Patients with suspected pneumococcal meningitis were empirically treated in the emergency room with both high-dose CTX (300-350 mg/kg/day - maximum 24g/day) and adjuvant therapy with dexamethasone, manitol and phenytoin. Once the S. pneumoniae susceptibliity was known, high-dose CTX schedule was kept if a CTX resistant strain (MIC > 1 mcg/mL) was isolated, or was changed to ceftriaxone (4 g a day) in susceptible cases (MIC < 1 mcg mL). MICs were determined by microdliution method and confirmed by E-test when avaliable. Cases with negative cultures because of previous b-lactamic antibiotic therapy but CSF positive antigen were considered as susceptible and treated with ceftriaxone. The duration of antibiotic therapy was 10 days.Results: Between 1990 and 2008, 93 patients (58 M/35 F), mean ag e62.2±15.3 (23-88), with ultimately proved pneumococcal meningitis by positive CSF culture or positive CSF pneumococcal antigen (BINAX), were empirically treated with high-dose CTX. 79 cases (85%) resulted CTX-susceptible and 14 (15%) CTX-resistant - 12 cases MIC 1 mcg/mL (85.7%) and 2 cases 2 mcg/mL (14.2%). High-dose CTX therapy was kept in all CTX-resistant cases and in 4 CTX-susceptible cases with MICs of 0.5 mcg/mL. Early adjuvant therapy was simliar in both groups. Among CTX resistant cases, one case was considered a clinical but not bacteriological faliure in the fifth day and then treated and cured by adding vancomycin without sequelae. Mortality was 5 patients (35%), all of them were patients with strains with MIC 1 mcg/mL, 2 cases due to early neurological complications and 3 cases due to late complications after finishing meningitis therapy.

418,418,Serological surveillance to pertussis vaccines in the NIP from 2004 till 2008. Switch from whole cell to acellular vaccine in children of 1 year,"Introduction: Since 2005, a new acellular pertussis vaccine has been administered to children in their first year of life in the national immunisation program (NIP). This followed the 2001 introduction of an acellular booster vaccination to the NIP schedule at the age of 4 years. The reason for these changes was the sharp increase in the incidence of pertussis cases from 1996 onwards. This is the main reason for the RIVM to monitor the effects of the pertussis vaccine changes between 2004 and 2008 conducted in over more that 400 children of 1 year of age. Materials and methods: In 9 locations spread over the country 443 children were included from the end of 2004 till mid 2007. They were divided in 4 study groups as follows: 1. 32 children fully vaccinated with the whole cell vaccine (WCV) in their first year of life; 2. 75 children vaccinated with WCV in the primary series and boostered with acellular vaccine (GSK) at 11 months; 3. 92 children fully vaccinated with ACV (GSK) in their first year of life; 4a. 128 children fully vaccinated with ACV (SP) in their first year of life; 4b. 109 children fully vaccinated with ACV (SP) and Prevenar (Wyeth). All antibody titers were determined with ELISA using international reference sera as standards, except for polio a neutralization assay was used. Results: Children who have been vaccinated with the new pertussis vaccine since 2005 produce more antibodies directed against whooping cough compared to the old WCV vaccine. Because the effect of this improved vaccination response will only be noticeable in the population at long term it is not clear at present whether or not the incidence of whooping cough will decrease. The other vaccine components including the recently introduced pneumococcal vaccine offer practically 100% protection. Conclusions: The RIVM recommends investigating, not only the composition of the NIP in the first year of life, but also the used vaccination schedule. At present, the so-called 3 + 1 schedule is employed during the first year of life, where children are vaccinated at 2, 3 and 4 months, followed by a booster at 11 months. The change made to the schedule in 1999-from 3, 4, 5 months to 2, 3, 4 months-appears to be less effective. The study has also revealed that the simultaneous administration of combination vaccines has limitations. If too many vaccines are combined this can have unexpected negative influences on the efficacy. Consequently, all changes made to the NIP deserve a good serological evaluation.

We investigated its ability to induce the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines by porcine brain microvascular endothelial cells (PBMEC). We demonstrated that live S. suis induced a strong release of interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 by PBMEC. We showed that the suilysin (hemolysin) was largely responsible for such stimulation, although cell wall components also contribute to cell stimulation but to a considerably lower extent. Interestingly, IL-8 production by PBMEC became undetectable by increasing either the incubation time or bacterial concentration of certain live S. suis strains. We further demonstrated that this decrease of IL-8 levels was probably linked to the production of a serine protease by S. suis. Our results suggest that S. suis can induce an exacerbated release of inflammatory mediators by swine endothelial cells that could cause a massive recruitment of leukocytes and subsequent blood-brain barrier breakdown facilitating the pathogenesis of S. suis-induced meningitis. In addition, S. suis could modulate this response by degrading IL-8 which might delay recruitment of S. suis killer-neutrophils to the site of inflammation, allowing this pathogen to survive upon its arrival to central nervous system. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

420,420,Streptococcus suis bacterin and subunit vaccine immunogenicities and protective efficacies against serotypes 2 and 9,"Streptococcus suis causes numerous diseases in pigs, most importantly, meningitis, arthritis, septicemia, and bronchopneumonia. One of the major problems in modern swine production is the lack of a vaccine protecting against more than one S. suis serotype. The objective of this study was to determine the protective efficacy of a serotype 2 murein-associated protein (MAP) fraction subunit vaccine in comparison to that of a bacterin against experimental challenge with serotype 2 (containing muramidase-released protein [MRP], extracellular factor, and suilysin [SLY]) and serotype 9 (containing MRP variant MRP* and SLY) strains. MAP was shown to include different surface-associated proteins, such as the MRP and surface antigen one (SAO) expressed by both pathotypes used for challenge. The results of this study demonstrated that the serotype 2 bacterin induced protective immunity against homologous challenge. In contrast, the protective efficacy of the MAP subunit vaccine was low, though MAP immunization resulted in high serum immunoglobulin G2 titers against MRP and SAO. Importantly, immunization with bacterin but not with MAP induced opsonizing antibody titers against the serotype 2 strain, and these antibody titers were found to correlate with protection. However, after absorption with a nonencapsulated isogenic mutant, the sera from bacterin-immunized piglets failed to facilitate neutrophil killing, indicating that antibodies directed against capsule may not have been essential for opsonophagocytosis. Furthermore, induction of opsonizing antibodies against serotype 9 was not detectable in the group receiving bacterin or in the group receiving the MAP vaccine. In agreement, protection against the heterologous serotype 9 strain was low in both groups. Thus, identification of an antigen protecting against these two important S. suis pathotypes remains an important goal of future studies. Copyright © 2009, American Society for Microbiology.

Aim: This study was designed to compare serum, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations of adhesion molecules in children with meningitis and sepsis, and to evaluate their sources. Setting : This study was carried out at Pediatric Department, King Abdulaziz University Hospital from January 2007 to June 2008. Design: Serum and CSF samples were collected on admission from meningitis (n = 40), sepsis (n = 20) patients, and sera from controls (n = 20). Materials and Methods : Endothelial (E), leukocyte (L), platelet (P) selectins intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), and vascular cell adhesion molecules-1 (VCAM-1) were measured using ELISA. Statistics : ANOVA and Spearman's correlations were used. Adhesion molecules with albumin concentration were estimated in CSF/serum to calculate concentration quotients. Results : In meningitis, serum sE-, sL-, sP-selectins sICAM-1, sVCAM-1 levels were higher than controls. Compared to sepsis, serum sE-selectin, sL-selectin, sVCAM-1, CSF-sL-selectin, CSF-sVCAM-1, VCAM-1 ratio and index were higher, while serum sP-selectin was lower than meningitis. sE-selectin ratio, CSF sICAM-1 were higher in meningitis with positive than negative culture.

We measured DTH responses to recall antigens (Tetanus, Diphteria, Streptococcus, Tuberculin, Candida, Trychophyton, Proteus, glycerin control) on the volar surface of the forearm in patients before and after successful reduction (50%) of the dose of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) or azathioprine (AZA). In addition, we tested healthy individuals who were age- and sex-matched to the patient group. Results of the skin reaction test were calculated as the sum in millimeters (mm) of all positive reactions (score), and as the number of positive antigens. Patients treated with a high dose of MMF or AZA had a significantly lower test score compared to healthy controls (p = 0.01). Also the number of positive antigens was reduced in patients compared to healthy controls (p = 0.02). After reduction of the MMF or AZA dose, the test score and the number of positive antigens increased significantly (p = 0.02, p = 0.01, respectively) to comparable scores of healthy controls. Additionally, the mycophenolic acid (MPA) trough level was negatively correlated with the test score (p = 0.006) and number of positive antigens (p = 0.004). In conclusion, successful tapering of the MMF or AZA dose in kidney transplant patients more than 2 years after transplantation favorably affects the in vivo DTH response, reflecting an improvement of the general immunity, facilitating the defense against infection and malignancies. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Methods: Fifty patients received a single oral dose of 400 mg as an antimicrobial prophylaxis regimen for a short urological procedure under spinal anaesthesia. Serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were sampled at different time intervals post-drug intake and patients were divided into five groups, as follows: group I: 0.5-1 h; group II: 1-2 h; group III: 2-4 h; group IV: 4-6 h; and group V: 6-8 h. Concentrations of moxifloxacin were estimated after analysis by an HPLC system. Bactericidal activity of CSF samples of groups III and IV was assessed by a microdilution technique against two penicillin-resistant isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae with MICs of moxifloxacin of 0.19 and 0.125 mg/L, respectively. Results: Mean CSF concentrations of moxifloxacin of groups I, II, III, IV and V were 0.19, 0.87, 3.00, 4.07 and 1.82 mg/L, respectively. The mean bactericidal activity of CSF of group III was 8 and that of group IV was 4.

437,437,Testing human biologicals in animal host resistance models,"The purpose of immunotoxicity testing is to obtain data that is meaningful for safety assessment. Host resistance assays are the best measure of a toxicant's effect on the overall ability to mount an effective immune response and protect the host from infectious disease. An outline is presented for immunotoxicological evaluation using host resistance assays. The influenza virus host resistance model is useful to evaluate the overall health of the immune system and is one of the most thoroughly characterized host resistance models. Viral clearance requires all aspects of the immune system to work together and is the ultimate measure of the health of the immune system in this model. Mechanistic immune functions may be included while measuring viral clearance and include: cytokines, macrophage activity, natural killer (NK) cell activity, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) activity, and influenza-specific IgM and IgG. Measurement of these immunological functions provides an evaluation of innate immunity (macrophage or NK activity), an evaluation of cell-mediated immunity (CMI) (CTL activity), and an evaluation of humoral-mediated immunity (HMI) (influenza-specific IgM or IgG). Measurement of influenza-specific IgM or IgG also provides a measurement of T-dependent antibody response (TDAR) since influenza is a T-dependent antigen. There are several targeted host resistance models that may be used to answer specific questions. Should a defect in neutrophil and/or macrophage function be suspected, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, or Listeria monocytogenes host resistance models are useful. Anti-inflammatory pharmaceuticals or therapeutics for rheumatoid arthritis or Crohn's disease that target TNFα may also be evaluated for immunotoxicity using the S. pneumoniae intranasal host resistance assay. Marginal zone B (MZB) cells are required for production of antibody to T-independent antigens such as the polysaccharide capsule of the encapsulated bacteria that are so prominent in causing blood-borne infections and pneumonia. Intravenous infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae, an encapsulated bacterium, results in a blood-borne infection that requires MZB cells for clearance. The systemic S. pneumoniae host resistance assay evaluates whether a therapeutic test article exerts immunotoxicity on MZB cells and measures the T-independent antibody response (TIAR). Suppression of CMI or in some cases HMI may result in reactivation of latent virus that may result in a fatal disease such as progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). The murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) reactivation model may be used to evaluate a pharmaceutical agent to determine if suppression of CMI or HMI results in reactivation of latent virus.

As a zoonotic agent, S. suis also causes similar diseases in humans. Binding of pathogenic bacteria to extracellular matrix components enhances their adhesion to and invasion of host cells. In the present study we isolated and identified a novel fibronectin-binding protein from S. suis. The native protein (designated SsEno) possessed not only high homology with other bacterial enolases but also enolase activity. We cloned, expressed and purified SsEno and showed that it is ubiquitously expressed by all S. suis serotypes and we identified its surface localization using immunoelectron microscopy. ELISA demonstrated that SsEno binds specifically to fibronectin and plasminogen in a lysine-dependent manner. Additional surface plasmon resonance assays demonstrated that SsEno binds to fibronectin or plasminogen with low nanomolar affinity. Inhibition experiments with anti-SsEno antibodies also showed that bacterial SsEno is important for the adhesion to and invasion of brain microvascular endothelial cells by S. suis.

440,440,Cerebro spinal fluid analysis in childhood bacterial meningitis,"Introduction: The aim of this study was to analyze the lumbar puncture of all suspected cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for suspected meningitis. Methods: This study was undertaken in the department of Child Health, the Royal Hospital. The details of CSF of all files of the children who had undergone lumbar puncture for suspected meningitis from January 1, 2004 to December 31, 2004; were enrolled for the study. Results: A total of 395 lumbar punctures were done to exclude bacterial meningitis. Out of the 142 CSF studies in neonates, 17 (12%) had the cytology suggestive of bacterial meningitis and 15 (88%) of them being culture positive. The commonest pathogen was Group B Streptococcus (70%).The bacterial antigens were positive only in 41% of the confirmed cases of bacterial meningitis, all being that of Group B Streptococcus and gram stain positivity in 45 percent of cases. In the 1-3 months group all the 17 lumbar punctures were normal. Of the 179 lumbar punctures done in 3-18 months group, only 11(6%) were abnormal, 72% being culture positive. Streptococcus pneumonia was the commonest organism (88%). Bacterial antigens were positive only in 2 of the 8 culture positive cases where gram stain was positive in 4 out of 8 cases. Irritability, lethargy and sick looking appearance were present in all the positive cases. None of the 28 children from 18 months to 5 years had abnormal CSF or positive CSF culture.

We now characterize a GBS Sia O-acetylesterase that modulates the degree of GBS surface O-acetylation. The GBS Sia O-acetylesterase operates cooperatively with the GBS CMP-Sia synthetase, both part of a single polypeptide encoded by the neuA gene. NeuA de-O-acetylation of free 9-Oacetyl-N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5,9Ac 2) was enhanced by CTP and Mg2+, the substrate and co-factor, respectively, of the N-terminal GBS CMP-Sia synthetase domain. In contrast, the homologous bifunctional NeuA esterase from Escherichia coli K1 did not display cofactor dependence. Further analyses showed that in vitro, GBS NeuA can operate via two alternate enzymatic pathways: de-O-acetylation of Neu5,9Ac2 followed by CMP activation of Neu5Ac or activation of Neu5,9Ac2 followed by de-O-acetylation of CMP-Neu5,9Ac2. Consistent with in vitro esterase assays, genetic deletion of GBS neuA led to accumulation of intracellular O-acetylated Sias, and overexpression of GBS NeuA reduced O-acetylation of Sias on the bacterial surface. Site-directed mutagenesis of conserved asparagine residue 301 abolished esterase activity but preserved CMP-Sia synthetase activity, as evidenced by hyper-O-acetylation of capsular polysaccharide Sias on GBS expressing only the N301A NeuA allele.

High levels of CXCL13 were present in the CSF of NB patients. It has not been clear, however, whether high CSF CXCL13 titers are specific for NB or are a characteristic of other spirochetal diseases as well. Furthermore, the mechanisms leading to the observed CXCL13 expression have not been identified yet. Here we describe similarly elevated CSF CXCL13 levels in patients with neurosyphilis, while pneumococcal meningitis patient CSF do not have high CXCL13 levels. In parallel, challenge of human monocytes in vitro with two of the spirochetal causative organisms, Borrelia garinii (the Borrelia species most frequently found in NB patients) and Treponema pallidum, but not challenge with pneumococci, induced CXCL13 release. This finding implies that a common spirochetal motif is a CXCL13 inducer. Accordingly, we found that the lipid moiety N-palmitoyl-S-(bis[palmitoyloxy]propyl)cystein (Pam 3C) (three palmitoyl residues bound to N-terminal cysteine) of the spirochetal lipoproteins is critical for the CXCL13 induction in monocytes. As the Pam3C motif is known to signal via Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) and an anti-TLR2 monoclonal antibody blocked CXCL13 production of human monocytes incubated with B. garinii, this suggests that TLR2 is a major mediator of Borrelia-induced secretion of CXCL13 from human monocytes.

446,446,A glimpse of streptococcal toxic shock syndrome from comparative genomics of S. suis 2 Chinese isolates,"Background. Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (SS2) is an important zoonotic pathogen, causing more than 200 cases of severe human infection worldwide, with the hallmarks of meningitis, septicemia, arthritis, etc. Very recently, SS2 has been recognized as an etiological agent for streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS), which was originally associated with Streptococcus pyogenes (GAS) in Streptococci. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying STSS are poorly understood. Methods and Findings. To elucidate the genetic determinants of STSS caused by SS2, whole genome sequencing of 3 different Chinese SS2 strains was undertaken. Comparative genomics accompanied by several lines of experiments, including experimental animal infection, PCR assay, and expression analysis, were utilized to further dissect a candidate pathogenicity island (PAI). Here we show, for the first time, a novel molecular insight into Chinese isolates of highly invasive SS2, which caused two large-scale human STSS outbreaks in China. A candidate PAI of ∼89 kb in length, which is designated 89K and specific for Chinese SS2 virulent isolates, was investigated at the genomic level.

Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (SS2) is an important zoonotic pathogen, causing more than 200 cases of severe human infection worldwide, with the hallmarks of meningitis, septicemia, arthritis, etc. Very recently, SS2 has been recognized as an etiological agent for streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS), which was originally associated with Streptococcus pyogenes (GAS) in Streptococci. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying STSS are poorly understood. Methods and Findings. To elucidate the genetic determinants of STSS caused by SS2, whole genome sequencing of 3 different Chinese SS2 strains was undertaken. Comparative genomics accompanied by several lines of experiments, including experimental animal infection, PCR assay, and expression analysis, were utilized to further dissect a candidate pathogenicity island (PAI). Here we show, for the first time, a novel molecular insight into Chinese isolates of highly invasive SS2, which caused two large-scale human STSS outbreaks in China. A candidate PAI of ∼89 kb in length, which is designated 89K and specific for Chinese SS2 virulent isolates, was investigated at the genomic level. It shares the universal properties of PAIs such as distinct GC content, consistent with its pivotal role in STSS and high virulence. Conclusions. To our knowledge, this is the first PAI candidate from S. suis worldwide.

Combinations of markers, as opposed to single ones, may improve diagnosis and thereby survival. We therefore compared the diagnostic characteristics of novel and routinely used biomarkers of sepsis alone and in combination. Methods: This prospective cohort study included patients with systemic inflammatory response syndrome who were suspected of having community-acquired infections. It was conducted in a medical emergency department and department of infectious diseases at a university hospital. A multiplex immunoassay measuring soluble urokinase-type plasminogen activator (suPAR) and soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells (sTREM)-1 and macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) was used in parallel with standard measurements of C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), and neutrophils. Two composite markers were constructed - one including a linear combination of the three best performing markers and another including all six - and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was used to compare their performance and those of the individual markers. Results:A total of 151 patients were eligible for analysis. Of these, 96 had bacterial infections. The AUCs for detection of a bacterial cause of inflammation were 0.50 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.40 to 0.60) for suPAR, 0.61 (95% CI 0.52 to 0.71) for sTREM-1, 0.63 (95% CI 0.53 to 0.72) for MIF, 0.72 (95% CI 0.63 to 0.79) for PCT, 0.74 (95% CI 0.66 to 0.81) for neutrophil count, 0.81 (95% CI 0.73 to 0.86) for CRP, 0.84 (95% CI 0.71 to 0.91) for the composite three-marker test, and 0.88 (95% CI 0.81 to 0.92) for the composite six-marker test.

We now characterized PCPEC cell death and investigated whether apoptosis or necrosis is responsible for the cytotoxicity after infection with different S. suis isolates. We found S. suis strain-dependent histone associated DNA-fragments quantified by ELISA. This response could partially be inhibited by cylcoheximide, cytochalasin D, dexamethasone, herbimycin A, but most effectively by the pan-caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk. We further detected caspase-3 and -9 activation after infection with all tested S. suis isolates that could also be blocked by zVAD-fmk. However, we found a significantly stronger caspase activity with the protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine. All tested S. suis isolates induced loss of cell viability in PCPEC as shown with the Live/Dead assay(R), but strain dependent lactate dehydrogenase-release. Both parameters could not be influenced by zVAD-fmk. Immunostaining showed release of high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) protein from the nucleus, indicative of necrosis. Transmission electron microscopy showed cell swelling, cytoplasmic vacuolization, loss of membrane integrity, nuclear fermentation but no nuclear condensation, indices for a primarily necrotic cell morphology.

451,451,Proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine modulation by Streptococcus suis in a whole-blood culture system,"Streptococcus suis is an important swine and human pathogen. Inflammation, a hallmark of S. suis infection, is thought to be responsible for most clinical signs of meningitis, septicaemia and sudden death. In this work, using a porcine whole blood model, S. suis serotype 2 was shown to trigger the release of several pro-inflammatory cytokines as evaluated by reverse transcriptase-PCR and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Although individual variations were observed among different S. suis strains, no correlations were observed between the strain origin/phenotype and cytokine levels. Live bacteria induced higher tumour necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) and IL-6 levels than did heat-killed bacteria. In contrast, heat-killed bacteria stimulated higher levels of IL-8 and monocyte chemotactic protein one (MCP-1). The bacterial cell wall was observed to be the major cytokine-inducting components, whereas capsule expression was important for MCP-1 activation. The presence of specific antibodies suppressed bacterial growth resulting in significantly reduced levels of cytokine production. Thus, antibody-mediated bacterial phagocytosis combined with suppressed inflammation may be beneficial for infection control strategies.

WBC and bacterial concentrations were determined in CSF and blood every second hour during a 16 hours study period together with CSF IL-8 and protein levels. We also studied CSF and blood WBC levels in 153 pneumococcal meningitis patients with and without presence of bacteraemia. Results: As designed, blood bacterial concentrations were significantly different among three experimental groups during the 16 hours study period (Kruskal Wallis test, P < 0.05), whereas no differences in CSF bacterial levels were observed (P > 0.05). Blood WBC decreased in bacteraemic rabbits between ∼10-16 hours after the bacterial inoculation in contrast to an increase for both the immunized rabbits and controls (P < 0.05). The CSF pleocytosis was attenuated in bacteraemic rabbits as compared to the two other groups between 12-16 hours from time of infection (P < 0.017), despite accelerated CSF IL-8 levels in bacteraemic rabbits.

The isolates were characterized by multilocus sequence typing (MLST), and the results were compared with those obtained by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and with the MLST data on invasive pneumococci from other countries. Eighty-nine different sequence types were found in the group of isolates, 50 of which had been known before including 19 of the major invasive clones. However, a significant fraction of the isolates possessed novel combinations of known and new MLST alleles. The majority of penicillin-nonsusceptible isolates belonged to the group of international multiresistant clones (Spain23F-1, Spain6B-2, Spain 9V-3, Poland23F-16, and Poland6B-20), which underlined the importance of these in the dissemination of antimicrobial resistance.

The isolates were characterized by multilocus sequence typing (MLST), and the results were compared with those obtained by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and with the MLST data on invasive pneumococci from other countries. Eighty-nine different sequence types were found in the group of isolates, 50 of which had been known before including 19 of the major invasive clones. However, a significant fraction of the isolates possessed novel combinations of known and new MLST alleles. The majority of penicillin-nonsusceptible isolates belonged to the group of international multiresistant clones (Spain23F-1, Spain6B-2, Spain 9V-3, Poland23F-16, and Poland6B-20), which underlined the importance of these in the dissemination of antimicrobial resistance. The results of the MLST analysis correlated well with the PFGE data, thus again demonstrating good congruence between the two typing methods for S. pneumoniae. The majority of the isolates (95.5%) belonged to families 1 or 2 of the surface protein PspA, confirming its potential usefulness as the vaccine antigen candidate.

458,458,Is there any role for innate immunity in the pathogenesis of bacterial and abacterial meningitis?,"To elucidate the role of innate immunity in the pathogenesis of meningitis, the effects of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and of sera from patients with bacterial and abacterial meningitis were studied on monocytes because of their resemblance in function with brain microglial cells. Monocytes were isolated from the mononuclear fraction of blood of healthy donors. They were incubated in growth medium single and in the presence of purified lipopolysaccharide or lipoteichoic acid of intact cells of Streptococcus pneumoniae and of samples of CSF and sera of patients. Samples were drawn from 10 patients with bacterial and 26 with abacterial meningitis. Concentrations of tumor necrosis factor α, interleukin (IL) 1β, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, and interferon γ were estimated in cell supernatants by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and of procalcitonin by an immunochemiluminometric assay. It was found that the addition of CSF from patients with bacterial meningitis induced higher concentrations of IL-β, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, and procalcitonin than controls and than the addition of CSF from patients with abacterial meningitis. Intact cells of S. pneumoniae failed to elicit similar responses to CSF of patients. The presence of CSF from patients with abacterial meningitis induced higher levels of interferon γ and IL-6 than controls. It is concluded that cells of the innate immunity play a considerable role in the pathogenesis of meningitis.

Design: Prospective observational study. Setting: Pediatric services of a tertiary care teaching and referral hospital. Subjects: A total of 30 consecutive children, 2 months to 12 yrs of age, with suspected bacterial meningitis. Methods: Serum cortisol levels (by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) obtained at admission were correlated with clinical characteristics (including Glasgow Coma Scale and Pediatric Risk of Mortality scores) recorded at admission and with neurologic and hearing status 2 months after discharge using SPSS 10.0. Results: Mean ± SD serum cortisol was 467 ± 251 ng/dL in patients with bacterial (n = 16) and 319 ± 159 ng/dL in aseptic meningitis (n = 14, p= .068). Glasgow coma scale score, systolic blood pressure, age, Pediatric Risk of Mortality, and cerebrospinal fluid protein were significant independent predictors of serum cortisol on stepwise multivariate regression analysis (each had an R2 change of >5%). Patients with neurologic or hearing sequelae had significantly higher median serum cortisol (450 ng/mL, n = 12) than those without sequelae (300 ng/mL, n = 17; p = .043 by Mann-Whitney U test). On multivariate logistic regression analysis, a serum cortisol of >420 ng/mL (odds ratio, 0.022; 95% confidence interval, 0.01-0.43) and systolic blood pressure (odds ratio, 1.35; 95% confidence interval, 1.04-1.74) were significant independent predictors of neurologic and hearing sequelae.

461,461,Role of fibrinogen-binding adhesin expression in septic arthritis and septicemia caused by Streptococcus agalactiae,"Background. Streptococcus agalactiae (group B streptococcus) is an important human pathogen that causes neonatal pneumonia, sepsis, septic arthritis, and meningitis, as well as severe infections in immunocompromised adult patients. The streptococci produce several molecules important for virulence. Methods. We used a murine model of sepsis and septic arthritis to assess the role of FbsA, a fibrinogen-binding adhesin of S. agalactiae as a virulence determinant. NMRI mice were inoculated intravenously with S. agalactiae strains isogenic for the expression of FbsA. Results. Inoculation with wild-type (wt) streptococci resulted in significantly higher mortality, more-pronounced weight decrease, and more-severe arthritis, compared with inoculation with the FbsA mutant isogenic strain. Neither active nor passive immunization with FbsA or FbsA-specific antibodies, respectively, resulted in any protection against subsequent infection with the S. agalactiae wt strain. Conclusion. Our results clearly indicate that the expression of FbsA by Streptococcus agalactiae is a significant virulence determinant in septic arthritis and septicemia. However, because blocking of the fibrinogen binding properties did not protect the host against the action of FbsA-expressing streptococci, we believe that the FbsA molecule has some other presently unknown biological in vivo properties. © 2005 by the Infectious Diseases Society of America.

462,462,Does the 23-valent pneumococcal vaccine protect cochlear implant recipients?,"Objectives/Hypothesis: The incidence of meningitis is increased in cochlear implant (CI) recipients. Besides malformations, immunological deficiencies are predisposing factors. Therefore, the immunological background of CI recipients and the immunogenicity of the recommended 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV-23) were investigated. Study Design: Prospective study in a tertiary care referral center. Methods: One hundred twenty CI recipients who were at least 5 years of age were vaccinated with PPV-23. Levels of immunoglobulins G, A, and M (IgG, IgA, and IgM, respectively) and IgG subclasses IgG1-IgG4 before vaccination and serum concentrations of antibodies against seven pneumococcal serotypes before and 4 weeks after vaccination were determined. The cohort was subdivided by patient age into groups A1 (5-8 y), A2 (8-12 y), and A3 (>12 y). Results: Geometric mean concentrations of pneumococcal antibodies before vaccination were remarkably low in all three groups, emphasizing the importance of vaccination in this risk group. All groups showed a statistically significant increase in geometric mean concentrations after immunization. For group A1 compared with groups A2 and A3, response was limited, especially for serotypes 6B (geometric mean concentration, 1.71 μg/mL; P = .0007), 23F (geometric mean concentration, 2.28 μg/mL; P = .04), and 14 (geometric mean concentration, 3.98 μg/mL; P = .0004). The percentages of patients reaching the presumed, protective threshold of at least 1 μg/mL pneumococcal antibody concentration were at least 71.1% in group A1, 93.8% in group A2, and 90.5% in group A3.

470,470,Childhood bacterial meningitis and usefulness of C-reactive protein,"Background: C-reactive protein raises rapidly in the first 24-48 hours of occurrence of bacterial meningitis and in large incremental increases thereafter. This prospective study was undertaken in a tertiary care hospital of Armed Forces to ascertain the usefulness of C-reactive protein in early diagnosis of bacterial meningitis. Methods: All children admitted during the period of study, with clinical suspicion of meningitis were clinically, biochemically, cytologically and bacteriologically investigated to clinch the diagnosis. Blood and CSF were also sent for C-reactive protein assay by latex agglutination test. CSF gram staining, culture and biochemical results were taken as gold standard. CSF and serum CRP were then evaluated against this gold standard. Statistical analysis was done by Epiinfo 6. Results: There were 63 cases of meningitis admitted in the hospital. By gold standard, there were 38 cases of bacterial, 21 cases of tubercular and 4 cases of viral meningitis. H. influenza was the predominant organism grown. CSF C-reactive protein was raised in 33 cases of bacterial and 2 cases of tubercular meningitis. Serum C-reactive protein was raised in 29 cases of bacterial, and eight cases of tubercular meningitis. These tests were negative in all cases of viral meningitis.

During the course of infection, S. agalactiae adheres to a variety of epithelial cells but the underlying mechanisms are only poorly understood. The present report demonstrates the importance of the fibrinogen receptor FbsA for the streptococcal adherence and invasion of epithelial cells. Deletion of the fbsA gene in various S. agalactiae strains substantially reduced their binding of soluble fibrinogen and their adherence to and invasion of epithelial cells, indicating a role of FbsA in these different processes. The adherence and invasiveness of an fbsA deletion mutant were partially restored by reintroducing the fbsA gene on an expression vector. Heterologous expression of fbsA in Lactococcus lactis enabled this bacterium to adhere to but not to invade epithelial cells, suggesting that FbsA is a streptococcal adhesin. Flow cytometry experiments revealed a dose-dependent binding of FbsA to the surface of epithelial cells.

479,479,Meningitis and pneumonia in Guatemalan children: The importance of Haemophilus influenzae type b and Streptococcus pneumoniae,"Objective. To determine the epidemiology of Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) and Streptococcus pneumoniae invasive infections in hospitalized Guatemalan children. This is an important issue since Hib vaccine has not been incorporated into the routine immunization program in Guatemala and information from hospital records in 1995 indicated a low incidence of Hib and S. pneumoniae as causes of meningitis and invasive infections. Methods. Children who were hospitalized in Guatemala City with clinical signs compatible with bacterial infections were evaluated for evidence of Hib or S. pneumoniae infection. Normally sterile body fluids were cultured, and antigen detection was performed on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and pleural fluid. Results. Of 1 203 children 1-59 months of age hospitalized over a 28-month period, 725 of them (60.3%) had a primary diagnosis of pneumonia, 357 (29.7%) of meningitis, 60 (5.0%) of cellulitis, and 61 (5.1%) of sepsis and other conditions. Hib was identified in 20.0% of children with meningitis and S. pneumoniae in 12.9%. The average annual incidence of Hib meningitis was 13.8 cases per 100 000 children under 5 years of age, and 32.4% of meningitides caused by Hib and 58.7% of S. pneumoniae meningitides occurred prior to 6 months of age. Case fatality rates were 14.1%, 37.0%, and 18.0%, respectively, for children with Hib, S. pneumoniae, and culture-negative and antigen-negative meningitis.

To determine the epidemiology of Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) and Streptococcus pneumoniae invasive infections in hospitalized Guatemalan children. This is an important issue since Hib vaccine has not been incorporated into the routine immunization program in Guatemala and information from hospital records in 1995 indicated a low incidence of Hib and S. pneumoniae as causes of meningitis and invasive infections. Methods. Children who were hospitalized in Guatemala City with clinical signs compatible with bacterial infections were evaluated for evidence of Hib or S. pneumoniae infection. Normally sterile body fluids were cultured, and antigen detection was performed on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and pleural fluid. Results. Of 1 203 children 1-59 months of age hospitalized over a 28-month period, 725 of them (60.3%) had a primary diagnosis of pneumonia, 357 (29.7%) of meningitis, 60 (5.0%) of cellulitis, and 61 (5.1%) of sepsis and other conditions. Hib was identified in 20.0% of children with meningitis and S. pneumoniae in 12.9%. The average annual incidence of Hib meningitis was 13.8 cases per 100 000 children under 5 years of age, and 32.4% of meningitides caused by Hib and 58.7% of S. pneumoniae meningitides occurred prior to 6 months of age. Case fatality rates were 14.1%, 37.0%, and 18.0%, respectively, for children with Hib, S. pneumoniae, and culture-negative and antigen-negative meningitis. Prior antibiotic therapy was common and was associated with significant reductions in CSF-culture-positive results for children with other evidence of Hib or S. pneumoniae meningitis. Conclusions. Improvements in case detection, culture methods, and latex agglutination for antigen detection in CSF resulted in identification of Hib and S. pneumoniae as important causes of severe disease in Guatemalan children.

These molecules are important virulence factors in many bacteria isolated from infected persons. Immunity against these components confers protection against the disease. However, developing vaccines based on polysaccharides is difficult and several problems have to be solved. First of all, most of the bacterial polysaccharides are T-lymphocyte independent antigens. Anti-polysaccharide immune response is characterised by lack of T-lymphocyte memory, isotype restriction and delayed ontogeny. Children below 2 years of age and elderly respond poorly to polysaccharide antigens. Secondly, the wide structural heterogeneity among the polysaccharides within and between species is also a problem. Thirdly, some bacterial polysaccharides are poor immunogens in humans due to their structural similarities with glycolipids and glycoproteins present in man. The T-lymphocyte independent nature of a polysaccharide may be overcome by conjugating the native or depolymerised polysaccharide to a protein carrier. Such neoglycoconjugates have been proven to be efficient in inducing T-lymphocyte dependent immunity and to protect both infants as well as elderly from disease. Another approach to circumvent the T-lymphocyte independent property of polysaccharides is to select peptides mimicking the immunodominant structures.

Aims: To estimate the proportion of ""unspecified"" mortality of infectious cause in infants and young children aged 1 month to 4 years reported by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) in England and Wales that could reasonably be attributed to IPD, thereby revising the total number of deaths per year potentially attributable to IPD, and producing a more accurate figure for the number of deaths that may be prevented by a programme of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination. Methods: Polymerase chain reaction, latex agglutination, and other alternate methodologies to microbiological culture have been applied in various studies to the detection of Streptococcus pneumoniae. Some of these tests have been shown to be more sensitive indicators of pneumococcal infection. In our analysis the implications of these tests were applied theoretically to the ""unspecified"" clinical deaths caused by septicaemia, meningitis, and pneumonia reported by the ONS, with a 20% correction/reduction factor for nasopharyngeal carriage which these sensitive tests may coincidentally detect. Results: The ONS reported an average of 13 deaths per year (1989-99) in infants and children aged 1 month to 4 years caused by pneumococcal septicaemia, meningitis, or pneumonia.

Since one hypothesis of the pathogenesis of S. suis infection is that bacteria enter the bloodstream and invade the meninges and other tissues in close association with mononuclear phagocytes, the objective of the present study was to evaluate the capacity of S. suis type 2 to adhere to macrophages. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique was standardized to simply and accurately measure the rate of bacterial attachment to phagocytic cells. Results were confirmed by plate counting. Adhesion was dependent on bacterial concentration and incubation time and was not affected by cytochalasin pretreatment of macrophages. Inhibition studies showed that the sialic acid moiety of the S. suis capsule would be, at least in part, responsible for bacterial recognition by macrophages. Serum preopsonization of bacteria increased adhesion levels. Complement would be partially implicated in the serum-enhanced binding of S. suis to cells. Adhesion varied among different S. suis type 2 isolates. However, high bacterial concentrations of several isolates were cytotoxic for cells, and these cytotoxic effects correlated with suilysin production.

499,499,Impact of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection on the epidemiology and outcome of bacterial meningitis in South African children,"Objective: To define the impact that the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) epidemic has had on the burden and outcome of bacterial meningitis in an area with a high prevalence of pediatric HIV-1 infection. Methods: Children less than 12 years of age with proven or suspected bacterial meningitis were enrolled in this study between March 1997 and February 1999, and their hospital records were retrospectively reviewed for clinical data. Results: Sixty-two (42.2%) of the 147 children tested for HIV-1 infection were infected. Streptococcus pneumoniae (Pnc) exceeded Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) as the most important cause of meningitis in HIV-1-infected (74.2% vs. 12.9%, respectively) compared with uninfected children (29.4% vs. 42.3%, respectively, P < 10-5). The estimated relative risk of Pnc meningitis was greater in HIV-1-infected than in uninfected children under 2 years of age (relative risk [RR] = 40.4; 95% confidence intervals [CI] = 17.7-92.2). Overall, HIV-1-infected children had a higher rate of mortality than uninfected children (30.6% vs. 11.8%, respectively, P = 0.01), and in particular, HIV-1-infected children with Pnc meningitis (60.8% vs. 36.0%, respectively, P = 0.04) had a poorer outcome.

512,512,Pneumococcal conjugate vaccination in toddlers: Mucosal antibody response measured as circulating antibody-secreting cells and as salivary antibodies,"Background. Our previous studies have shown an antibody-secreting cell (ASC) response to pneumococcal vaccines in adults and suggested that a high IgA ASC response is an indicator of a secretory IgA response in saliva. We believe that the mucosal immune response is potentially an important characteristic of the pneumococcal vaccines and should thus be measured when the new pneumococcal conjugate vaccines are evaluated. Objectives. To study mucosal and serum antibody responses to pneumococcal conjugate vaccines in toddlers. Methods. Each investigational vaccine, containing either 3 or 10 μg of pneumococcal PS serotypes 6B, 14, 19F and 23F conjugated to either diphtheria toxoid (PncD) or tetanus protein (PncT), was administered to 10 children (a total of 40 children). The ASC response was measured on Day 7 after immunization by enzyme-linked immunospot assay, and the salivary and serum antibodies were measured before and 7 and 28 days after the immunization by enzyme immunoassay. Results. The vaccines studied induced ASC responses to the pneumococcal polysaccharides (PS) in all children vaccinated. The ASC responses to the PS components of the vaccine (the geometric mean number of ASCs varying from 120 to 160 ASC/106 cells) were lower than those seen earlier in adults after conjugate vaccine (240 to 2015 ASC/106 cells), but comparable with those seen earlier in adults after pneumococcal PS vaccine (113 to 136 ASC/106 cells).

527,527,Discontinuing penicillin prophylaxis in children with sickle cell anemia,"Objective: To evaluate the consequences of discontinuing penicillin prophylaxis at 5 years of age in children with sickle cell anemia who had received prophylactic penicillin for much of their lives. Design: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Setting: Eighteen teaching hospitals throughout the United States. Patients: Children with sickle cell anemia (hemoglobin SS or hemoglobin S β0-thalassemia) who had received prophylactic penicillin therapy for at least 2 years immediately before their fifth birthday and had received the 23-valent pneumococcal vaccine between 2 and 3 years of age and again at the time of randomization. Of 599 potential candidates, 400 were randomly selected and followed for an average of 3.2 years. Interventions: After randomization, patients received the study medication twice daily-either penicillin V potassium, 250 mg, or an identical placebo tablet. Patients were either seen in the clinic or contacted every 3 months thereafter for an interval history and dispensing of the study drug. A physical examination was scheduled every 6 months. Main outcome measures: The primary end point was a comparison of the incidence of bacteremia or meningitis caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae in children continuing penicillin prophylaxis versus those receiving the placebo. Results: Six children had a systemic infection caused by S. pneumoniae, four in the placebo group (2.0%; 95% confidence interval 0.5%, 5.0%) and two in the continued penicillin prophylaxis group (1.0%; 95% confidence interval 0.1%, 3.6%), with a relative risk of 0.5 (95% confidence interval 0.1, 2.7). All invasive isolates were either serotype 6(A or B) or serotype 23F. Four of the isolates were penicillin susceptible, and two (one from each treatment group) were penicillin and multiply antibiotic resistant.

Design: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Setting: Eighteen teaching hospitals throughout the United States. Patients: Children with sickle cell anemia (hemoglobin SS or hemoglobin S β0-thalassemia) who had received prophylactic penicillin therapy for at least 2 years immediately before their fifth birthday and had received the 23-valent pneumococcal vaccine between 2 and 3 years of age and again at the time of randomization. Of 599 potential candidates, 400 were randomly selected and followed for an average of 3.2 years. Interventions: After randomization, patients received the study medication twice daily-either penicillin V potassium, 250 mg, or an identical placebo tablet. Patients were either seen in the clinic or contacted every 3 months thereafter for an interval history and dispensing of the study drug. A physical examination was scheduled every 6 months. Main outcome measures: The primary end point was a comparison of the incidence of bacteremia or meningitis caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae in children continuing penicillin prophylaxis versus those receiving the placebo. Results: Six children had a systemic infection caused by S. pneumoniae, four in the placebo group (2.0%; 95% confidence interval 0.5%, 5.0%) and two in the continued penicillin prophylaxis group (1.0%; 95% confidence interval 0.1%, 3.6%), with a relative risk of 0.5 (95% confidence interval 0.1, 2.7).

529,529,"Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies on cefozopran in the pediatric field","Cefozopran (CZOP, SCE-2787), a newly developed parenteral cephem antibiotic, was administered to children with bacterial infections. We determined its antibacterial activity, pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety in these patients. 1. Antibacterial activity. MICs of cefmetazole, ceftazidime, cefuzonam, flomoxef and CZOP were determined against a total of 19 strains. For Gram-positive cocci, MICs of CZOP ranged from 0.39 to 0.78 μg/ml against Staphylococcus aureus (3 strains), from 0.05 to 6.25 μg/ml against Streptococcus pneumoniae (5 strains), and 12.5 μg/ml against Enterococcus faecalis (1 strain). These MICs were generally similar to those of other cephems, but the MIC of CZOP against E. faecalis was lower than those of the other cephems examined. For Gram-negative bacilli, MICs of CZOP were 25 μg/ml against Citrobacter freundii (1 strain), and 6.25 μg/ml against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1 strain). These values were similar to or lower than those of other cephems, MICs of CZOP against Haemophilus influenzae (7 strains) ranged from 0.1 to 0.39 μg/ml. However, the MIC of CZOP against Serratia marcescens (1 strain) was higher than 100 μg/ml, and CZOP was ineffective as the other cephems against this organism. 2. Pharmacokinetics. CZOP was administered to children at 20 or 40 mg/kg via intravenous injection, and determinations were made for its serum concentrations, urinary concentrations and concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) using the bioassay. Serum concentrations at 30 minutes after administration were 60.4 μg/ml with a dose of 20 mg/kg to one patient and 93.9 and 99.0 μg/ml with 40 mg/kg to two patients. The corresponding half-lives were 1.55 hours for 20 mg/kg administration, and 1.10 and 3.41 hours for 40 mg/kg, while the AUCs were 136.5 μg·hr/ml for 20 mg/kg, and 194.4 and 264.5 μg·hr/ml for 40 mg/kg. The rates of urinary recovery in the first 8 hours after administration were 45.0% in the patient receiving 20 mg/kg, and 84.6 and 97.6% in the two patients receiving 40 mg/kg. The concentrations in the CSF determined in 3 patients with purulent meningitis ranged from 2.6 to 16.0 μg/ml 1 hour after administration, and the CSF/serum concentration ratio ranged from 6.5 to 39.0%. These values for pharmacokinetic parameters obtained in the bioassay were similar to those obtained using HPLC. 3. Clinical evaluation. Forty-eight patients were clinically evaluated. Of these patients, 75% were less than 3 years of age and there were slightly more male children than female children. Most of the patients were administered with about 20 mg/kg of CZOP 3 or 4 times per day, and were treated for 6 to 10 days. Forty-six of the 48 patients including 2 with purulent meningitis showed excellent or good clinical responses, yielding an efficacy rate of 95.8%. One patient with pharyngo-laryngitis, 3 with sinusitis, 2 with purulent meningitis, 7 with urinary tract infections, 1 with impetigo, 3 with staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome and 2 with phlegmon were rated as having excellent or good clinical responses to the treatment.

614,614,Erythema nodosum. Studies on aetiology and pathogenesis in 185 adult cases,"A detailed study of 178 adult patients admitted to St. Gøran's Hospital, Stockholm, during the period January 1942, to June 1944. There were, besides, seven other patients, one of whom proved to have erythema multiforme. This condition was also a complication in six of the nodal fever patients. There was a high preponderance of females in the 187 cases admitted to hospital - 166 females to 12 males. Twenty-six of the female cases were in age group 15 19, 38 in each of age groups 20-24 and 25-29, 25 in each of age groups 30-34 and 35-39, eight at 40-44 and six at 45 and over. The incidence in relation to the female population was highest in age group 15-19 years, thereafter decreasing with age. Six of the male cases occurred in age group 15-19 years; four at 20-24 years, one at 25-29 years and one at 40-44 years. Though the number of male cases is small, there is a suggestion of a similar diminishing age trend in adult life. Cases of nodal fever occurring in Stockholm over the same period among children showed an incidence moderately high in both sexes, the female incidence slightly exceeding the male. From the age of puberty, however, the male incidence fell rapidly, while the female incidence increased to a maximum at 15-19 years. Erythema nodosum, as experienced in Stockholm, is thus a disease of childhood in males and of adolescence in females. To determine the possible cause of the disease in each case, a full clinical examination was made, supplemented by skin tests, antistreptolysin titre estimations, chest skiagrams, bacteriological examinations and electrocardiograms. Sensitivity to tuberculin was determined by intradermal tests using old tuberculin in dilutions of 1/1,000,000, 1/100,000 1/10,000, 1/1,000 and 1/100. The initial test was made with 1/10,000 and in most cases tests with 1/100,000 and 1/1,000,000 were done at the same time. Negative reactors were tested further with 1/1,000 and, if necessary, 1/100 dilutions. In the 178 cases, 84 (47.2 per cent) gave a very strong reaction (a papule of 15 mm diameter at least to 1/10,000); 35 (19.7 per cent) a strong reaction (a papule of 10-14 mm diameter to 1/10,000); 34 (19.1 per cent) a moderate reaction (positive to 1/1,000); eight (4.5 per cent) a weak reaction (positive to 1/100) and 17 (19.6 per cent) were negative. Reactions to 1/100,000 tuberculin were obtained in 20 of the very strong reactors; none reacted to 1/1,000,000 dilution. On the basis of clinical and other examinations, of which the most significant were the isolation of the tubercle bacillus from the stomach washings and the appearance in X-ray examinations of unilateral enlarged hilar glands with or without a parenchymatous lesion in the lungs, 78 (43.8 per cent) were diagnosed as cases of recent active tuberculosis of the primary type. Ten were known to be tuberculin negative before onset. Sixty-four occurred among the 84 very strong tuberculin reactors and tubercle bacilli were recovered from the gastric washings in 52; 12 were in the group of 35 strong tuberculin reactors, tubercle bacilli being recovered from the gastric washings in ten; two occurred in the 42 moderate or weak tuberculin reactors, and there were none in the 17 negative reactors. By the X2 test, there was a significant association between the degree of tuberculin sensitivity and the occurrence of recent active tuberculosis. An additional 26 cases from the combined evidence of a high sensitivity to tuberculin and suggestive X-ray appearances not otherwise confirmed, were presumed also to have recent active tuberculosis. Seventeen were in the group of very strong reactors to tuberculin and nine among the strong reactors. Thus, altogether 104 (58.4 per cent) of the 178 cases were considered to have erythema nodosum arising from tuberculosis. On the other hand, 29 cases had evidence of old tuberculous lesions, but, in the absence of signs of activity, and in some cases with other infections being present as the possible cause, the tuberculous infection was not regarded as an aetiological factor. Most of the cases showed weak or moderate tuberculin reactions. None were tuberculin negative. Skin tests were also made to determine sensitivity to beta-haemolytic streptococci, using a suspension of the organism, killed by heat and given intradermally in a dose of 0.1 ml at a concentration of 100 million per ml. Two strains of Lancefield's group A streptococci isolated by throat culture from erythema nodosum patients were used simultaneously as routine tests. Tests were read as positive if a reaction of at least 12 mm diameter was obtained at 48 hours, including in the measurement both papule and the surrounding halo. An average of the two tests was taken as the reading. A hundred and seventy-four patients were thus tested and 34 (19.5 per cent) gave a very strong of strong reaction, 62 (35.7 per cent) gave a moderate or weak reaction, and 78 (44.8 per cent) were negative. As a control measure, 65 female students of a teachers' college were submitted to skin tests and were found to give reactions to the streptococcal suspensions similar to the nodal fever patients; 11 (16.9 per cent) gave a very strong or strong reaction; 32 (49.2 per cent) gave a moderate or weak reaction; and 22 (33.8 per cent) were negative. Tests carried out with other Lancefield strains and some Griffith's strains gave similar reactions, showing that the skin sensitivity was not specific to the type of organism. Tests with alpha-haemolytic streptococci, staphylococci and pneumococci gave weak or moderate reactions in a few cases only, the majority of the subjects tested being negative. On the combined evidence of skin sensitivity, the occurrence of sore throat or other focal infection, the presence in throat culture of beta-haemolytic streptococci, and an elevated anti-streptolysin titre (over 200 units), it was concluded that in 30 patients (16.9 per cent) of the series the erythema nodosum was due to beta-haemolytic streptococcal infection. (No single finding alone could be accepted in evidence, as abnormal results were also obtained, though less frequently, in the other groups). Eighteen had marked clinical signs of acute streptococcal infection and an antistreptolysin titre of over 400 units; five were in the group of seven very strong reactors to the skin tests, ten in the 27 strong reactors, and three in the 62 moderate or weak reactors. Another aetiological group were six cases of lymphogranuloma benigna (Boeck's sarcoidosis). The cases showed the characteristic miliary mottling in the lungs associated with enlarged hilar gland shadows. The diagnosis was verified histologically in two of the patients. A further group of nine patients had bilateral enlargement of the hilar glands and a negative or weak to moderate tuberculin reaction. A diagnosis of sarcoidosis was not made in the absence of typical lung mottling. Three cases were characterized by false positive seroreactions for syphilis associated with acute respiratory infections and a high blood sedimentation rate. In the remaining 26 cases the cause of the erythema nodosum could not be determined. Biopsy of the nodules was made in 64 cases. Irrespective of the aetiology, the histological picture was the same - a non-specific inflammation in the skin. The group examined included 26 tuberculous, 14 streptococcal, four sarcoid, ten bilateral hilar lymphadenopathies, and nine other cases. One sarcoid case had a typical skin lesion which on biopsy presented the sarcoid reaction, whilst an erythematous nodule which was excised showed the usual non-specific inflammatory reaction. In 30 patients an attempt was made as a diagnostic measure to evoke the typical skin lesion of sarcoid by injecting intradermally B.C.G. vaccine either live or killed, or non-specific irritants such as aluminium silicate or liquid paraffin, but the results were negative. Eighteen (10 per cent) of the 178 cases gave a history of a previous attack, intervals ranging from nine months to 31 years. In 11 cases, there was evidence of old tuberculous infection which may have been the cause of the earlier attack. Symptoms of a recent focal infection, commonly sore throat, but also coryza and dental infections, occurred in 90 per cent of the streptococcal group, usually within 4 to 14 days of the onset of the nodal fever. Anginal tonsillitis occurred most often in the group with a marked skin reaction and a high anti-streptolysin titre. In the tuberculous and other groups symptoms of such antecedent focal infection occurred in just over 30 per cent. Painful joints, accompanied by swelling in about 50 per cent, were a common feature of the disease, occurring in 46 per cent of the tuberculous cases, 63 per cent of the streptococcal cases, and highest of all, 77.3 per cent in the remaining cases. There was no clinical differentiation in the joint affections between the various groups. Electrocardiograms demonstrated myocardial damage in only 5 of the 178 cases. Changes were either a flattening or an inversion of the T wave. There was no evidence that erythema nodosum was associated with rheumatic fever. The conclusion reached by the author is that erythema nodosum is a non-specific reaction of the skin, liable to occur in certain diseases which have as a common feature of their pathology involvement of the lymph glands (primary tuberculosis, beta-haemolytic streptococcal infection, sarcoidosis, coccidioidosis, lymphogranuloma inguinale). In this series of adult cases, tuberculosis and streptococcal infection were the main causes and a high degree of skin sensitivity was closely associated with the occurrence of the disease, the sensitivity to tuberculin and to the streptococcal vaccine having a significant inverse relationship. The tuberculous cases were of the active primary type. It is rare for erythema nodosum to be associated with active post-primary tuberculosis.",FALSE,"Erythema nodosum.

616,616,Enhanced diagnosis of pneumococcal meningitis with use of the Binax NOW immunochromatographic test of Streptococcus pneumoniae antigen: a multisite study,"Background. Accurate etiological diagnosis of meningitis in developing countries is needed, to improve clinical care and to optimize disease-prevention strategies. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) culture and latex agglutination testing are currently the standard diagnostic methods but lack sensitivity. Methods. We prospectively assessed the utility of an immunochromatographic test (ICT) of pneumococcal antigen (NOW Streptococcus pneumoniae Antigen Test; Binax), compared with culture, in 5 countries that are conducting bacterial meningitis surveillance in Africa and Asia. Most CSF samples were collected from patients aged 1-59 months. Results. A total of 1173 CSF samples from suspected meningitis cases were included. The ICT results were positive for 68 (99%) of the 69 culture-confirmed pneumococcal meningitis cases and negative for 124 (99%) of 125 culture-confirmed bacterial meningitis cases caused by other pathogens. By use of culture and latex agglutination testing alone, pneumococci were detected in samples from 7.4% of patients in Asia and 15.6% in Africa. The ICT increased pneumococcal detection, resulting in similar identification rates across sites, ranging from 16.2% in Nigeria to 20% in Bangladesh. ICT detection in specimens from culture-negative cases varied according to region (8.5% in Africa vs. 18.8% in Asia; P <.001), prior antibiotic use (24.2% with prior antibiotic use vs. 12.2% without; P <.001), and WBC count (9.0% for WBC count of 10-99 cells/mL, 22.1% for 100-999 cells/mL, and 25.4% for ≥1000 cells/mL; P <.001 by test for trend). Conclusions. The ICT provided substantial benefit over the latex agglutination test and culture at Asian sites but not at African sites. With the addition of the ICT, the proportion of meningitis cases attributable to pneumococci was determined to be similar in Asia and Africa. These results suggest that previous studies have underestimated the proportion of pediatric bacterial meningitis cases caused by pneumococci. © 2009 by the Infectious Diseases Society of America.

METHODS: Serum and/or CSF samples were collected from AES patients admitted at Gandhi Memorial and Associated Hospital King George's Medical University Lucknow a tertiary care centre UP during 2014-16. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum samples from cases were tested for IgM antibodies against Japanese encephalitis virus (anti-JEV) and dengue virus (anti-DENV) by ELISA; and for enterovirus herpes simplex virus (HSV) and varicella zoster virus (VZV) by real-time PCR. Serum samples of cases having sufficient CSF volume were also tested for anti-scrub typhus IgM antibodies and for Neisseria meningitides Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. RESULTS: JEV and DENV (8% each) were the most common identified aetiology from the 4092 enrolled patients. Enterovirus HSV and VZV each were detected in <1% AES cases.

638,638,New Strategy Is Needed to Prevent Pneumococcal Meningitis.,BACKGROUND: Polysaccharide conjugate vaccines (PCVs) target the pneumococcal capsular types that most commonly cause fatal pneumonia and sepsis. Because these types were eliminated by the vaccines it became apparent that in immunized populations most invasive pneumococcal diseases including bacteremia sepsis and complicated pneumonia were greatly reduced. However the protective effects of PCVs against another invasive disease meningitis has shown much less or no decrease in disease incidence. METHODS: References were identified through searches of PubMed for articles published from January 1930 to the present by use of specific search terms. Relevant articles were also identified through searches in Google and Google Scholar. Relevant references cited in those articles were also reviewed. RESULTS: Even in the presence of the PCVs meningitis rates in children have been reported globally to be as high as 13 per 100 000 annually. Widespread use of vaccines resulted in the emergence of a broad diversity of replacement non-PCV type strains. These strains generally failed to cause sepsis but caused meningitis of comparable severity and levels similar to or in excess of prior pneumococcal meningitis rates. This is probably because these non-PCV type strains do not survive well in the blood therefore possibly entering the brain through nonhematogenous routes. CONCLUSIONS: Because virtually all cases of pneumococcal meningitis lead to either permanent neurologic sequelae or death it would be well worth the effort to develop a new vaccine capable of preventing pneumococcal meningitis regardless of capsular type. Such a vaccine would need to protect against colonization with most if not all pneumococci.['Journal Article' 'Research Support N.I.H. Extramural']None,FALSE,New Strategy Is Needed to Prevent Pneumococcal Meningitis.BACKGROUND: Polysaccharide conjugate vaccines (PCVs) target the pneumococcal capsular types that most commonly cause fatal pneumonia and sepsis. Because these types were eliminated by the vaccines it became apparent that in immunized populations most invasive pneumococcal diseases including bacteremia sepsis and complicated pneumonia were greatly reduced. However the protective effects of PCVs against another invasive disease meningitis has shown much less or no decrease in disease incidence. METHODS: References were identified through searches of PubMed for articles published from January 1930 to the present by use of specific search terms. Relevant articles were also identified through searches in Google and Google Scholar. Relevant references cited in those articles were also reviewed. RESULTS: Even in the presence of the PCVs meningitis rates in children have been reported globally to be as high as 13 per 100 000 annually. Widespread use of vaccines resulted in the emergence of a broad diversity of replacement non-PCV type strains. These strains generally failed to cause sepsis but caused meningitis of comparable severity and levels similar to or in excess of prior pneumococcal meningitis rates. This is probably because these non-PCV type strains do not survive well in the blood therefore possibly entering the brain through nonhematogenous routes. CONCLUSIONS: Because virtually all cases of pneumococcal meningitis lead to either permanent neurologic sequelae or death it would be well worth the effort to develop a new vaccine capable of preventing pneumococcal meningitis regardless of capsular type.

641,641,Role of the urokinase plasminogen activator system in patients with bacterial meningitis.,"BACKGROUND: The urokinase plasminogen activator system has the potency to promote leukocyte recruitment and blood-CSF barrier breakdown and thus may play an important pathophysiologic role in bacterial meningitis. METHODS: CSF and serum concentrations of urokinase-plasminogen activator (urokinase [uPA]) uPA receptor (uPAR) and PA inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) were quantified by ELISA in 12 patients with bacterial meningitis control patients (n = 10) with noninflammatory neurologic diseases and 10 patients with Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) a disease in which blood-CSF barrier disruption occurs without CSF pleocytosis. Casein zymography was used to determine PA-dependent plasminogen activation in the CSF. RESULTS: A marked increase in uPA-dependent plasminogen activation was detected in the CSF of patients with bacterial meningitis vs CSF of patients with GBS and controls. Accordingly ELISA analysis of CSF revealed intrathecal upregulation of uPA protein in patients with bacterial meningitis. CSF concentrations of uPAR and PAI-1 were also elevated in these patients. The serum of patients with bacterial meningitis showed elevated protein levels of uPA but not uPAR or PAI-1. Positive correlations were found between blood-CSF barrier breakdown and CSF uPA concentrations and between CSF pleocytosis and CSF/serum ratios of the potent chemokine uPAR in patients with bacterial meningitis. Furthermore an adverse clinical outcome in these patients correlated with serum uPA concentrations.

All initial CSF samples which on culture grew S. pneumoniae were positive in the EIA. A total of 14 subsequent culture-negative samples gave clear signals in the EIA up to day 15 after the onset of antibiotic treatment. For 11 CSF specimens culture microscopy and latex agglutination were negative while the EIA detected pneumococcal antigens. The EIA did not react either with CSF of patients with meningitis caused by bacteria other than S. pneumoniae or by viral pathogens.

651,651,Identification of bacterial aetiology in acute meningitis.,BACKGROUND: The lack of rapid and sensitive test remains a key issue in diagnosing meningitis and affordability impedes using the molecular techniques. However conventional PCR is currently becoming more affordable. OBJECTIVES: Optimize and establish a multiplex PCR and to compare the above PCR to Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) culture and antigen detection in sensitivity and specificity for the detection of bacterial meningitis. METHODS: CSF specimens were collected from patients with suspected acute meningitis admitted to Teaching Hospital Peradeniya from December 2016 to March 2017. A multiplex PCR was used to detect Neisseria meningitides Streptococcus pneumonia and Haemophilus influenzae. RESULTS: Eighty specimens of CSF were collected during the study period. The mean duration to sample collection was 4.78(SD 2.6) from the onset of symptoms. None of the samples given positive CSF culture. CSF antigen detection was performed on 50 specimens and all were negative. Of the total samples eight yielded positive PCR results. In two of the positives the full report was normal one was suggestive of viral aetiology and five were suggestive of bacterial aetiology. Three were positive for S.pneumoniae and five for H.influenzae. positive PCR results were associated with a shorter time gap between hospitalization and sample collection and a larger CSF volume. CONCLUSION: Findings of the study highlight the usefulness and recommendation of multiplex PCR in the diagnosis of pathogens causing acute bacterial meningitis. Collection of an adequate volume of CSF early in the illness without delay may improve the diagnosis.['Journal Article']None,FALSE,Identification of bacterial aetiology in acute meningitis.BACKGROUND: The lack of rapid and sensitive test remains a key issue in diagnosing meningitis and affordability impedes using the molecular techniques.

EXPERT OPINION: The maintenance of robust immunisation programmes with high uptake rates is important in maintaining low rates of disease. Epidemiological surveillance systems are essential in monitoring any changes in infectious disease trends and in identifying emerging infections such as from non-typeable H. influenzae pneumococcal serotype replacement disease and changes in the epidemiology of meningococcal serogroups. This is important to guide future vaccine development.

656,656,Genetic conjugation of components in two pneumococcal fusion protein vaccines enhances paediatric mucosal immune responses.,"Streptococcus pneumoniae colonises the upper respiratory tract and can cause pneumonia meningitis and otitis media. Existing pneumococcal conjugate vaccines are expensive to produce and only protect against 13 of the 90+ pneumococcal serotypes; hence there is an urgent need for the development of new vaccines. We have shown previously in mice that pneumolysin (Ply) and a non-toxic variant (Δ6Ply) enhance antibody responses when genetically fused to pneumococcal surface adhesin A (PsaA) a potentially valuable effect for future vaccines. We investigated this adjuvanticity in human paediatric mucosal primary immune cell cultures. Adenoidal mononuclear cells (AMNC) from children aged 0-15 years (n=46) were stimulated with conjugated admixed or individual proteins cell viability and CD4+ T-cell proliferative responses were assessed using flow cytometry and cytokine secretion was measured using multiplex technology. Proliferation of CD4+ T-cells in response to PsaAPly was significantly higher than responses to individual or admixed proteins (p=0.002). In contrast an enhanced response to PsaAΔ6Ply compared to individual or admixed proteins only occurred at higher concentrations (p<0.01). Evaluation of cytotoxicity suggested that responses occurred when Ply-induced cytolysis was inhibited either by fusion or mutation but importantly an additional toxicity independent immune enhancing effect was also apparent as a result of fusion. Responses were MHC class II dependent and had a Th1/Th17 profile. Genetic fusion of Δ6Ply to PsaA significantly modulates and enhances pro-inflammatory CD4+ T-cell responses without the cytolytic effects of some other pneumolysoids. Membrane binding activity of such proteins may confer valuable adjuvant properties as fusion may assist Δ6Ply to deliver PsaA to the APC surface effectively contributing to the initiation of anti-pneumococcal CD4+ T-cell immunity.['Journal Article' ""Research Support Non-U.S. Gov't""]None",FALSE,"Genetic conjugation of components in two pneumococcal fusion protein vaccines enhances paediatric mucosal immune responses.Streptococcus pneumoniae colonises the upper respiratory tract and can cause pneumonia meningitis and otitis media.

Methods employed by these kits are staphylococcal coagglutination (COA) and latex agglutination (LA). The COA ""Phadebact CSF-kit"" (Pharmacia) detects Haemophilus influenzae type b (HIb) Neisseria meningitidis (NM) groups A B C Y and W 135 and Streptococcus pneumoniae (SP) whereas the LA ""Slidex Méningite-kit"" (BioMérieux) includes HIb NM A NM C and SP. These two diagnostic tests were compared with the standard methods for analyzing CSF specimens from children with suspected meningitis. A total of 336 CSF specimens were tested. Forty-three were from children with bacterial meningitis due to HIb NM or SP obtained before antimicrobial therapy. Thirty-four of them (79%) were correctly detected by COA 23 (54%) by LA and 42 (97%) by microscopic analysis of stained smears. There were 65 CSF samples of such meningitis cases obtained after initiation of antimicrobial therapy: COA detected 26 (40%) LA 17 (26%) and staining 26 (40%). With culture-positive CSF specimens from patients before therapy the best sensitivities were obtained with LA for SP (100%) and COA for HIb (87%) whereas the results for NM antigen detection were only 43% with COA and 0% with LA (no reagent against NM B).

Thus we conclude that physicians need to be aware of the possible development of cervical pyogenic spondylitis and meningoencephalitis subsequent to Streptococcus pneumoniae infection and symptoms such as fever and neck pain should be carefully examined.['Case Reports' 'English Abstract' 'Journal Article']None,FALSE,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 660}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 660}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 660}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 660}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 660}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 660}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 660}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 660}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 660}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 660}",1
661,661,Discovery of novel Streptococcus pneumoniae antigens by screening a whole-genome lambda-display library.,Streptococcus pneumoniae is a causative agent of otitis media pneumonia meningitis and sepsis in humans. For the development of effective vaccines able to prevent pneumococcal infection characterization of bacterial antigens involved in host immune response is crucial. In order to identify pneumococcal proteins recognized by host antibody response we created an S. pneumoniae D39 genome library displayed on lambda bacteriophage. The screening of such a library with sera either from infected individuals or mice immunized with the S. pneumoniae D39 strain allowed identification of phage clones carrying S. pneumoniae B-cell epitopes. Epitope-containing fragments within the families of the histidine-triad proteins (PhtE PhtD) the choline-binding proteins (PspA CbpD) and zinc metalloproteinase B (ZmpB) were identified. Moreover library screening also allowed the isolation of phage clones carrying three distinct antigenic regions of a hypothetical pneumococcal protein encoded by the ORF spr0075 in the R6 strain genome sequence. In this work Spr0075 is first identified as an expressed S. pneumoniae gene product having an antigenic function during infection.['Journal Article']None,FALSE,Discovery of novel Streptococcus pneumoniae antigens by screening a whole-genome lambda-display library.Streptococcus pneumoniae is a causative agent of otitis media pneumonia meningitis and sepsis in humans.

METHODS: during the study period 3476 cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimens from 2824 adults (1578 men 1246 women) were analysed in the Laboratory of Microbiology at the Centre Hospitalier de Kigali Rwanda Central Africa using direct examination culture and detection of the cryptococcal antigen (CrAg) in the CSF. RESULTS: CM was diagnosed among 549 (19%) patients (347 men 202 women) and was by far the leading cause of meningitis before Neisseria meningitidis (n=115) Streptococcus pneumoniae (n=68) Mycobacterium tuberculosis (n=26). E. coli Klebsiella pneumoniae non-typhoid Salmonella (n=l5) and streptococci (n=4). The number of CM increased from one case in 1983 to 130 new cases in 1992. All 293 tested CM patients had HIV-1 antibodies. The male/female ratio declined from 3.31 during 1983-1987 to 1.58 during 1988-1992. CM showed a seasonal fluctuation the highest number of infections being observed during the long rainy season. The sensitivity and specificity of the latex test for diagnosing CM was 98% and 99% respectively.

METHODS: We assessed the incidence and clinical characteristics of delayed cerebral thrombosis in adults with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) culture-proven community-acquired bacterial meningitis included in a prospective nationwide study in The Netherlands performed from 2006 to 2012. RESULTS: Delayed cerebral thrombosis occurred in 11 of 1 032 episodes (1.1%). CSF culture yielded Streptococcus pneumoniae in ten patients and Listeria monocytogenes in one. Adjunctive dexamethasone therapy was administered before or with the first dose of antibiotics in 9 of 11 patients; two patients were initially not treated with dexamethasone. All patients made good initial recovery followed by sudden deterioration after 7-42 days. Cranial imaging studies showed multiple cerebral infarctions in all patients. The outcome was unfavorable in all but one patient. In an explorative analysis patients with delayed cerebral thrombosis had eightfold higher complement C5a CSF concentrations on the diagnostic lumbar puncture as compared in those without delayed cerebral thrombosis (p = 0.04). CONCLUSION: Delayed cerebral thrombosis is a rare but devastating complication of bacterial meningitis.

To identify virulence factors preferentially expressed during meningitis we conducted niche-specific genome-wide in vivo transcriptomic analysis after intranasal infection of mice with serotype 4 or 6A pneumococci. The expression of 34 bacterial genes was substantially altered in brain tissue of mice infected with either of the 2 strains. Ten upregulated genes were common to both strains 7 of which were evaluated for their role in the development of meningitis. One previously uncharacterized protein α-glycerophosphate oxidase (GlpO) was cytotoxic for human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs) via generation of H(2)O(2). A glpO deletion mutant was defective in adherence to HBMECs in vitro as well as in progression from the blood to the brain in vivo. Mutant bacteria also induced markedly reduced meningeal inflammation and brain pathology compared with wild type despite similar levels of bacteremia. Immunization of mice with GlpO protected against invasive pneumococcal disease and provided additive protection when formulated with pneumolysin toxoid.

Manganese and zinc ions are essential for this bacterium playing regulatory structural or catalytic roles as the critical cofactors in the bacterial proteins and metabolic enzymes. Lipoprotein PsaA has been found to mediate Mn(2+) and Zn(2+) transportation in Streptococcus pneumoniae. In the present work we conducted a systemic study on the contributions from key amino acids in the metal-binding site of PsaA using various spectroscopic and biochemical methods. Our experimental data indicate that four metal-binding residues contribute unequally to the Mn(2+) and Zn(2+) binding and His139 is most important for both the structural stability and metal binding of the protein. PsaA-Mn(2+) has a lower thermal stability than PsaA-Zn(2+) possibly due to the different coordination preferences of the metals. Kinetics analysis revealed that PsaA-Mn(2+) binding is a fast first-order reaction whereas PsaA-Zn(2+) binding is a slow second-order reaction implying that PsaA kinetically prefers binding Mn(2+) to Zn(2+).

METHODS: Thirty-three patients with basilar skull fracture and 23 patients undergoing transsphenoidal pituitary gland surgery were vaccinated with PPSV within 10days after neurotrauma or neurosurgery. Twenty-nine neurosurgical patients vaccinated ⩾3weeks after neurotrauma or neurosurgery served as controls. Serotype-specific anti-polysaccharide binding IgG antibody levels to serotypes 4 6B 9V 14 18C 19F and 23F were determined by enzyme immunoassay. RESULTS: The vaccination was safe and a highly significant antibody response was found against all serotypes in all groups (p<0.001 for each of the serotypes).

Furthermore several cross-reactions between genera as well as within species were noted. These findings suggest that precautions must be taken to insure that all materials used in CIE tests are of high quality.

These characteristics would induce an anti-polysaccharide response even in the pediatric population which was heretofore unable to mount protective responses to the polysaccharide. With the advent of conjugate vaccines for the above three mentioned bacteria the incidence of bacteremia meningitis and otitis media has almost been eliminated.

697,697,Serotyping of Brunei pneumococcal clinical strains and the investigation of their capability to adhere and invade a brain endothelium model.,INTRODUCTION: Pneumococcal infections have caused morbidity and mortality globally. Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococci) are commensal bacteria that colonize the nasopharynx asymptomatically. From there pneumococci can spread in the lungs causing pneumonia and disseminate in the bloodstream causing bacteremia (sepsis) and reach the brain leading to meningitis. Endothelial cells are one of the most important components of the blood-brain barrier that separates the blood from the brain and plays the first protective role against pneumococcal entry. Thus this study aimed to investigate on the ability of non-meningitis pneumococcal clinical strains to adhere and invade a brain endothelium model. METHODS: Two pneumococcal Brunei clinical strains were serotyped by multiplex PCR method using oligonucleotide sequences derived from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A validated immortalised mouse brain endothelial cell line (bEnd.3) was used as a brain endothelium model for the study of the pneumococcal breach of the blood-brain barrier using an adherence and invasion assay. RESULTS: Both of the pneumococcal clinical strains were found to be serotype 19F a common circulating serotype in Southeast Asia and globally and possess the ability to adhere and invade the brain endothelial cells.

Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococci) are commensal bacteria that colonize the nasopharynx asymptomatically. From there pneumococci can spread in the lungs causing pneumonia and disseminate in the bloodstream causing bacteremia (sepsis) and reach the brain leading to meningitis. Endothelial cells are one of the most important components of the blood-brain barrier that separates the blood from the brain and plays the first protective role against pneumococcal entry. Thus this study aimed to investigate on the ability of non-meningitis pneumococcal clinical strains to adhere and invade a brain endothelium model. METHODS: Two pneumococcal Brunei clinical strains were serotyped by multiplex PCR method using oligonucleotide sequences derived from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A validated immortalised mouse brain endothelial cell line (bEnd.3) was used as a brain endothelium model for the study of the pneumococcal breach of the blood-brain barrier using an adherence and invasion assay. RESULTS: Both of the pneumococcal clinical strains were found to be serotype 19F a common circulating serotype in Southeast Asia and globally and possess the ability to adhere and invade the brain endothelial cells. CONCLUSION: In addition this is the first report on the serotype identification of pneumococci in Brunei Darussalam and their application on a brain endothelium model. Further studies are required to understand the virulence capabilities of the clinical strains.['Journal Article']None,FALSE,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 697}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 697}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 697}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 697}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 697}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 697}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 697}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 697}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 697}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 697}",1
698,698,"Hearing impairment after childhood bacterial meningitis dependent on etiology in Luanda, Angola.","OBJECTIVE: Childhood bacterial meningitis (BM) damages hearing but the potential of different agents to cause impairment in developing countries is poorly understood. We compared the extent of hearing impairment in BM caused by Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) Streptococcus pneumoniae or Neisseria meningitidis among children aged 2 months to 13 years in Luanda Angola. METHODS: Hearing of 685 ears of 351 (78%) survivors among 723 enrolled patients was tested by brainstem-evoked response audiometry on day 7 of hospitalization. The causative agent was sought by cerebrospinal fluid culture PCR or the latex-agglutination test. RESULTS: Altogether 45 (12%) of the survivors were deaf (threshold >80 dB) and 20 (6%) had a threshold of 80 dB. The incidence of any kind of hearing loss with ≥60 dB was 34% with Hib 30% with S. pneumoniae 19% with N. meningitidis and 33% with other bacteria. Examining all ears combined and using the ≥60 dB threshold the agents showed dissimilar harm (P=0.005) Hib being the most frequent and N. meningitidis the most infrequent cause. Compared to other agents S. pneumoniae more often caused deafness (P=0.025) and hearing impairment at ≥60 dB (P=0.017) in infants whereas this level of hearing loss in older survivors was most commonly caused by Hib (P=0.031). CONCLUSIONS: BM among children in Angola is often followed by hearing impairment but the risk depends on the agent.

Pneumococci cause meningitis by invading the blood and penetrating the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Using stimulated emission depletion (STED) super-resolution microscopy of brain biopsies from patients who died of pneumococcal meningitis we observe that pneumococci colocalize with the two BBB endothelial receptors: polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR) and platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM-1). We show that the major adhesin of the pneumococcal pilus-1 RrgA binds both receptors whereas the choline binding protein PspC binds but to a lower extent only pIgR. Using a bacteremia-derived meningitis model and mutant mice as well as antibodies against the two receptors we prevent pneumococcal entry into the brain and meningitis development.

703,703,Relaxed substrate specificity leads to extensive tRNA mischarging by Streptococcus pneumoniae class I and class II aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases.,Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases provide the first step in protein synthesis quality control by discriminating cognate from noncognate amino acid and tRNA substrates. While substrate specificity is enhanced in many instances by cis- and trans-editing pathways it has been revealed that in organisms such as Streptococcus pneumoniae some aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases display significant tRNA mischarging activity. To investigate the extent of tRNA mischarging in this pathogen the aminoacylation profiles of class I isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase (IleRS) and class II lysyl-tRNA synthetase (LysRS) were determined. Pneumococcal IleRS mischarged tRNA(Ile) with both Val as demonstrated in other bacteria and Leu in a tRNA sequence-dependent manner. IleRS substrate specificity was achieved in an editing-independent manner indicating that tRNA mischarging would only be significant under growth conditions where Ile is depleted. Pneumococcal LysRS was found to misaminoacylate tRNA(Lys) with Ala and to a lesser extent Thr and Ser with mischarging efficiency modulated by the presence of an unusual U4:G69 wobble pair in the acceptor stems of both pneumococcal tRNA(Lys) isoacceptors. Addition of the trans-editing factor MurM which also functions in peptidoglycan synthesis reduced Ala-tRNA(Lys) production by LysRS providing evidence for cross talk between the protein synthesis and cell wall biogenesis pathways. Mischarging of tRNA(Lys) by AlaRS was also observed and this would provide additional potential MurM substrates. More broadly the extensive mischarging activities now described for a number of Streptococcus pneumoniae aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases suggest that adaptive misaminoacylation may contribute significantly to the viability of this pathogen during amino acid starvation. IMPORTANCE: Streptococcus pneumoniae is a common causative agent of several debilitating and potentially life-threatening infections such as pneumonia meningitis and infectious endocarditis. Such infections are increasingly difficult to treat due to widespread development of penicillin resistance. High-level penicillin resistance is known to depend in part upon MurM a protein involved in both aminoacyl-tRNA-dependent synthesis of indirect amino acid cross-linkages within cell wall peptidoglycan and in translation quality control. The involvement of MurM in both protein synthesis and antibiotic resistance identify it as a potential target for the development of new and potent antibiotics for pneumococcal infections. The goals of this work were to identify and characterize S. pneumoniae pathways that can synthesize mischarged tRNAs and to relate these activities to expected changes in protein and peptidoglycan biosynthesis during antibiotic and nutritional stress.['Journal Article' 'Research Support N.I.H.

One protein that has been shown to play a role in treponemal dissemination is Tp0751 a T. pallidum adhesin that interacts with host components found within the vasculature and mediates bacterial adherence to endothelial cells under shear flow conditions. In this study we further explore the molecular interactions of Tp0751-mediated adhesion to the vascular endothelium. We demonstrate that recombinant Tp0751 adheres to human endothelial cells of macrovascular and microvascular origin including a cerebral brain microvascular endothelial cell line. Adhesion assays using recombinant Tp0751 N-terminal truncations reveal that endothelial binding is localized to the lipocalin fold-containing domain of the protein. We also confirm this interaction using live T. pallidum and show that spirochete attachment to endothelial monolayers is disrupted by Tp0751-specific antiserum. Further we identify the 67-kDa laminin receptor (LamR) as an endothelial receptor for Tp0751 using affinity chromatography coimmunoprecipitation and plate-based binding methodologies.

Importantly LamR is also a receptor for meningitis-causing neuroinvasive bacterial pathogens such as Neisseria meningitidis Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae Our findings enhance understanding of the Tp0751 adhesin and present the intriguing possibility that the molecular events of Tp0751-mediated treponemal dissemination may mimic the endothelial interaction strategies of other invasive pathogens.['Journal Article' 'Research Support N.I.H.

706,706,[Etiology of suppurative bacterial meningitis].,The results of the laboratory examination of 2034 patients with meningococcal infection and purulent meningitides hospitalized during the period of June 1980 to October 1983 revealed that three main etiological agents were responsible for these diseases: meningococci pneumococci and Haemophilus influenzae. The susceptibility of the patients to different etiological agents was found to depend on their age. Children aged up to 3 years constituted 75% of the patients with meningitis caused by H. influenzae; 50% of the patients with meningococcal infection were children aged up to 5 years; pneumococcal meningitis occurred more frequently in adults. Serogroup A meningococci were found to prevail in patients with meningococcal infection. Besides in children serogroup C meningococci could be isolated in 24% of cases.

Differing from Neisseria meningitidis (the second most common cause of acute bacterial meningitis) contact tracing and chemoprophylaxis are not required. At postmortem the differentiation between S. pneumoniae and N. meningitidis is traditionally done by culture and polymerase chain reaction performed on blood or cerebrospinal fluid but may take hours if not days to analyze. We present a death from bacterial meningitis in a 73-year-old woman in which a rapid urinary pneumococcal antigen testing was able to identify S. pneumoniae as the causative organism within 1 hour. This was confirmed by subsequent brain swab culture. The rapid urinary pneumococcal antigen test in the case prevented the need for contact tracing and chemoprophylaxis.

We evaluated the utility of the BioFire® FilmArray® Meningitis/Encephalitis multiplex PCR panel (BioFire ME) in HIV-infected adults and HIV-infected and uninfected children presenting with suspected meningitis in Uganda. METHODS: We tested cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) using a stepwise meningitis diagnostic algorithm including BioFire ME. We determined the diagnostic performance of BioFire ME for cryptococcal meningitis using cryptococcal antigen (CrAg) and CSF culture as reference standards and assessed other central nervous system (CNS) pathogens identified by the panel. RESULTS: We evaluated 328 adult and 42 pediatric CSF specimens using BioFire ME. Of the adult CSF samples tested 258 were obtained at baseline and 70 were obtained from repeat lumbar punctures in cryptococcal meningitis. For Cryptococcus sensitivity was 82% specificity was 98% PPV was 98% and NPV was 79% in baseline specimens using CSF CrAg as the reference standard. Among follow-up specimens a negative BioFire ME for Cryptococcus predicted CSF culture sterility with 84% NPV. Overall sensitivity was decreased at low fungal burdens: 29% for 0-99 Cryptococcus CFU/mL compared to 94% for ≥100 CFU/mL in baseline specimens. Other pathogens detected included E.

715,715,Evaluation of a rapid urine antigen assay for the detection of invasive pneumococcal disease in children.,"OBJECTIVE: Streptococcus pneumoniae remains the most common cause of occult bacteremia bacterial pneumonia and meningitis in young febrile children. We sought to determine the utility of a pneumococcal urine antigen assay among young febrile children at varying risk of invasive pneumococcal disease. METHODS: We prospectively enrolled 5 groups of children 3 months to 5 years of age who presented to an urban pediatric emergency department or hospital-based clinic between January 1 2000 and April 1 2001. The groups enrolled included 1) children with pneumococcal bacteremia 2) febrile children with pneumonia 3) febrile nonbacteremic children with leukocytosis 4) febrile nonbacteremic children with normal white blood cell (WBC) counts and 5) afebrile children with no evidence of current or recent bacterial infection. RESULTS: Of 346 children enrolled positive assay results were found in 23 (95%) of 24 with pneumococcal bacteremia (95% confidence interval [CI]: 77%-100%) 47 (76%) of 62 with lobar pneumonia (95% CI: 63%-85%) 28 (15%) of 181 nonbacteremic children with fever (95% CI: 11%-22%) with no difference among patients with elevated WBC counts (18%; 95% CI: 11%-27%) compared with those with normal WBC counts (11%; 95% CI: 5%-21%) and 6 of 79 patients without fever (8%; 95% CI: 3%-16%). CONCLUSIONS: This S pneumoniae antigen detection assay demonstrated high sensitivity for proven (bacteremic) and suspected (focal pneumonia) invasive pneumococcal infections. The rate of false-positive test results among febrile children without identified pneumococcal infection is approximately 15%.

Although not ideal this combination of sensitivity and specificity compares favorably with other available tests such as the WBC or absolute neutrophil count used to screen children for clinically unsuspected pneumococcal infections.['Evaluation Study' 'Journal Article' ""Research Support Non-U.S. Gov't"" ""Research Support U.S. Gov't P.H.S.""]None",FALSE,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 715}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 715}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 715}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 715}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 715}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 715}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 715}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 715}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 715}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 715}",1
716,716,Minimizing the release of proinflammatory and toxic bacterial products within the host: a promising approach to improve outcome in life-threatening infections.,"Various bacterial components (e.g. endotoxin teichoic and lipoteichoic acids peptidoglycans DNA) induce or enhance inflammation by stimulating the innate immune system and/or are directly toxic in eukariotic cells (e.g. hemolysins). When antibiotics which inhibit bacterial protein synthesis kill bacteria smaller quantities of proinflammatory or toxic compounds are released in vitro and in vivo than during killing of bacteria by beta-lactams and other cell-wall active drugs. In general high antibiotic concentrations liberate lower quantities of bacterial proinflammatory or toxic compounds than concentrations close to the minimum inhibitory concentration. In animal models of Escherichia coli Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus peritonitis/sepsis and of Streptococcus pneumoniae meningitis a lower release of proinflammatory bacterial compounds was associated with a reduced mortality or neuronal injury. Pre-treatment with a bacterial protein synthesis inhibitor reduced the strong release of bacterial products usually observed during treatment with a beta-lactam antibiotic. Data available strongly encourage clinical trials comparing antibiotic regimens with different release of proinflammatory/toxic bacterial products. The benefit of the approach to reduce the liberation of bacterial products should be greatest in patients with a high bacterial load.['Journal Article' ""Research Support Non-U.S. Gov't"" 'Review']None",FALSE,"Minimizing the release of proinflammatory and toxic bacterial products within the host: a promising approach to improve outcome in life-threatening infections.Various bacterial components (e.g. endotoxin teichoic and lipoteichoic acids peptidoglycans DNA) induce or enhance inflammation by stimulating the innate immune system and/or are directly toxic in eukariotic cells (e.g. hemolysins).

718,718,The association between antibody levels before and after 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine immunization and subsequent pneumococcal infection in chronic arthritis patients.,"INTRODUCTION: The aim of present study is to inverstigate the association between antibody levels after vaccination with 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) and subsequent serious pneumococcal infections in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and spondylarthropathy (SpA) patients. METHODS: A cohort of 497 patients (RA=248 and SpA=249) received a single dose of PCV7. At vaccination patients were treated with methotrexate (MTX; n=85) anti-tumour necrosis factor (anti-TNF) + MTX (n=169) anti-TNF monotherapy (n=158) and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)/analgesics (n=85). Antibody levels of serotypes 6B and 23B were analyzed before and 4 to 6 weeks after vaccination using standard enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Serious pneumococcal infections (pneumonia/lower respiratory tract infection meningitis sepsis septic arthritis) occurring within 4.5 years after vaccination were identified in the Skåne Healthcare Register using the International Classification of Diseases tenth revision (ICD-10) codes. The association between post-vaccination antibody levels and protection against infections and determination of protective cutoff levels was explored using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Predictors of infection were studied using regression analyses. RESULTS: Eighteen infections were registered in 15 patients before vaccination and 27 infections in 23 patients after vaccination. Patients with serious infections after vaccination had significantly lower post-vaccination antibody titres for both 6B (P=0.04) and 23 F (P=0.04). Post-vaccination antibody levels of at least 1.29 mg/L and 1.01 mg/L for 6B and 23 respectively were associated with better protection from serious infections.

We measured LBP in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of children with proven invasive infection caused by Haemophilus influenzae Streptococcus pneumoniae and Neisseria meningitidis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Samples were collected from 39 children (aged 2 months to 17 years) with bacterial sepsis (n = 19) or meningitis (n = 20). Bacterial infection was diagnosed when a blood or CSF culture was positive and clinical signs of invasive infection were present. The control group consisted of serum (n = 60) and CSF (n = 19) samples from children with neurologic disease juvenile idiopathic arthritis or viral infection. In 10 patients with bacterial infection follow-up samples (24 and 48 hours) were available. LBP values were measured by an immunochemiluminescence analyzer (IMMULITE; DPC Biermann Bad Nauheim Germany) and compared with tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-8 concentrations. RESULTS: The median LBP serum concentrations in patients with bacterial infection were markedly elevated compared with the control groups (45.0 [33.1-55.2] versus 8.3 [6.8-10.1] microg/mL [median and 5-95% confidence interval]; P < 0.0001). Follow-up serum values of LBP were persistently elevated despite adequate antibiotic treatment whereas tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-8 concentrations decreased. In contrast LBP concentrations in the CSF were below the detection limit of 0.5 microg/mL in 67% of patients with bacterial meningitis (median <0.5 microg/mL) whereas tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-8 levels were highly elevated.

METHODS: Surveillance of bacterial meningitis among children aged <5 years was set up at 18 hospitals in southern Pakistan that fulfilled the following criteria: (1) >30 pediatric admissions weekly (2) skilled personnel to perform lumbar punctures and (3) close proximity to an Aga Khan University Hospital laboratory collection point. RESULTS: A total of 2690 children were admitted to the hospital with suspected acute bacterial meningitis and 2646 (98%) underwent lumbar puncture. Of the 2646 cerebrospinal fluid specimens obtained 412 (16%) were purulent and pathogens were detected by culture or latex agglutination testing in 83 (20.1%) of the purulent specimens. Of the 83 isolates detected 48 (57.8%) were Haemophilus influenzae type b 32 (38.5%) were Streptococcus pneumoniae and 3 (3.6%) were Neisseria meningiditis. Overall 81% of the pathogens detected were from children aged <1 year. More than 50% of families reported definite prior antimicrobial use. The minimum detected incidence rates of purulent meningitis in Hyderabad were 112 cases per 100 000 children aged <1 year and 45.3 cases per 100 000 children aged <5 years. After adjustment for limitations in access to care and the low sensitivity of cerebrospinal fluid culture the adjusted incidence rates of pneumococcal meningitis were 81 cases per 100 000 children aged <1 year (95% confidence interval 26.2-190.5 cases per 100 000) and 20 cases per 100 000 children aged <5 years (95% confidence interval 7.3-43.7 cases per 100 000).

Here we report data and lessons learnt from four years of surveillance in the district of Moissala Chad. METHODS: All suspected cases of meningitis were referred free of charge to the district hospital for lumbar puncture and treatment. Cerebrospinal fluid samples were tested with Pastorex latex agglutination in Moissala and inoculated trans-isolate media were used for culture and PCR at the national reference laboratory and/or at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health. RESULTS: From July 2012 to December 2016 237 suspected cases of meningitis were notified and a specimen was collected from 224. Eighty-three samples were positive for a bacterial pathogen by culture PCR or Pastorex including 58 cases due to Streptococcus pneumoniae with only 28 of 49 pneumococcal meningitis confirmed by culture or PCR correctly identified by Pastorex. Four cases of NmA were detected by Pastorex but none were confirmed by PCR. CONCLUSION: Implementation of case-based surveillance for meningitis is feasible in Chad but has required political and technical engagement.

Of 50 CSF samples from patients with culture-proven bacterial meningitis 90% were correctly shown by the LA test to contain antigen of the responsible organism. Gram-staining revealed organisms in 80% of 45 of these samples. In 75% of the 40 samples that were of sufficient volume for CIE positive results for the appropriate antigen were obtained. The concentration of antigen detected in the CSF by the LA test varied from undetectable to 800 000 ng/ml. Patients with a high concentration (more than 2000 ng/ml or a positive result at dilutions of CSF over 1/8) were significantly more likely to have a poor response to therapy (two died and two had persistent pleocytosis or bacteria in the CSF) than patients with a lower concentration (4/16 v. 0/18 P < 0.05). After appropriate therapy was begun the concentration of antigen fell dramatically but measurable amounts of antigen persisted in the CSF for up to 6 days. The LA test detected bacterial antigen at concentrations 2 to 70 times below the lower limit detected by CIE. In seven additional patients who had received antibiotics before lumbar puncture was performed the LA test detected antigen from meningitis-causing bacteria even though cultures of the CSF were sterile.

Of 50 CSF samples from patients with culture-proven bacterial meningitis 90% were correctly shown by the LA test to contain antigen of the responsible organism. Gram-staining revealed organisms in 80% of 45 of these samples. In 75% of the 40 samples that were of sufficient volume for CIE positive results for the appropriate antigen were obtained. The concentration of antigen detected in the CSF by the LA test varied from undetectable to 800 000 ng/ml. Patients with a high concentration (more than 2000 ng/ml or a positive result at dilutions of CSF over 1/8) were significantly more likely to have a poor response to therapy (two died and two had persistent pleocytosis or bacteria in the CSF) than patients with a lower concentration (4/16 v. 0/18 P < 0.05). After appropriate therapy was begun the concentration of antigen fell dramatically but measurable amounts of antigen persisted in the CSF for up to 6 days. The LA test detected bacterial antigen at concentrations 2 to 70 times below the lower limit detected by CIE.

726,726,Clinical Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates induce differing CXCL8 responses from human nasopharyngeal epithelial cells which are reduced by liposomes.,BACKGROUND: Streptococcus pneumoniae causes several human diseases including pneumonia and meningitis in which pathology is associated with an excessive inflammatory response. A major inducer of this response is the cholesterol dependent pneumococcal toxin pneumolysin. Here we measured the amount of inflammatory cytokine CXCL8 (interleukin (IL)-8) by ELISA released by human nasopharyngeal epithelial (Detroit 562) cells as inflammatory response to a 24 h exposure to different pneumococcal strains. RESULTS: We found pneumolysin to be the major factor influencing the CXCL8 response. Cholesterol and sphingomyelin-containing liposomes designed to sequester pneumolysin were highly effective at reducing CXCL8 levels from epithelial cells exposed to different clinical pneumococcal isolates. These liposomes also reduced CXCL8 response from epithelial cells exposed to pneumolysin knock-out mutants of S. pneumoniae indicating that they also reduce the CXCL8-inducing effect of an unidentified pneumococcal virulence factor in addition to pneumolysin. CONCLUSION: The results indicate the potential of liposomes in attenuating excessive inflammation as a future adjunctive treatment of pneumococcal diseases.['Journal Article']None,FALSE,Clinical Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates induce differing CXCL8 responses from human nasopharyngeal epithelial cells which are reduced by liposomes.BACKGROUND: Streptococcus pneumoniae causes several human diseases including pneumonia and meningitis in which pathology is associated with an excessive inflammatory response.

728,728,Streptococcus pneumoniae serotype-2 childhood meningitis in Bangladesh: a newly recognized pneumococcal infection threat.,"BACKGROUND: Streptococcus pneumoniae is a leading cause of meningitis in countries where pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV) targeting commonly occurring serotypes are not routinely used. However effectiveness of PCV would be jeopardized by emergence of invasive pneumococcal diseases (IPD) caused by serotypes which are not included in PCV. Systematic hospital based surveillance in Bangladesh was established and progressively improved to determine the pathogens causing childhood sepsis and meningitis. This also provided the foundation for determining the spectrum of serotypes causing IPD. This article reports an unprecedented upsurge of serotype 2 an uncommon pneumococcal serotype without any known intervention. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Cases with suspected IPD had blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) collected from the beginning of 2001 till 2009. Pneumococcal serotypes were determined by capsular swelling of isolates or PCR of culture-negative CSF specimens. Multicenter national surveillance expanded from 2004 identified 45 437 patients with suspected bacteremia who were blood cultured and 10 618 suspected meningitis cases who had a lumber puncture. Pneumococcus accounted for 230 culture positive cases of meningitis in children <5 years. Serotype-2 was the leading cause of pneumococcal meningitis accounting for 20.4% (45/221; 95% CI 15%-26%) of cases. Ninety eight percent (45/46) of these serotype-2 strains were isolated from meningitis cases yielding the highest serotype-specific odds ratio for meningitis (29.6; 95% CI 3.4-256.3). The serotype-2 strains had three closely related pulsed field gel electrophoresis types. CONCLUSIONS: S. pneumoniae serotype-2 was found to possess an unusually high potential for causing meningitis and was the leading serotype-specific cause of childhood meningitis in Bangladesh over the past decade.

These techniques have further emphasized the significance of pneumococcal infections. The recent finding of pneumococci resistant to penicillin and some other antibiotics also emphasizes the need for immunological prophylaxis.

The candidate combox site 4 (ccs4) gene has been reported to be a pneumococcal competence-induced gene. Such genes are involved in development of S. pneumoniae competence and virulence though the functions of ccs4 remain unknown. In the present study the role of Ccs4 in the pathogenesis of pneumococcal meningitis was examined. We initially constructed a ccs4 deletion mutant and complement strains then examined their association with and invasion into human brain microvascular endothelial cells. Wild-type and Ccs4-complemented strains exhibited significantly higher rates of association and invasion as compared to the ccs4 mutant strain. Deletion of ccs4 did not change bacterial growth activity or expression of NanA and CbpA known brain endothelial pneumococcal adhesins. Next mice were infected either intravenously or intranasally with pneumococcal strains. In the intranasal infection model survival rates were comparable between wild-type strain-infected and ccs4 mutant strain-infected mice while the ccs4 mutant strain exhibited a lower level of virulence in the intravenous infection model. In addition at 24 hours after intravenous infection the bacterial burden in blood was comparable between the wild-type and ccs4 mutant strain-infected mice whereas the wild-type strain-infected mice showed a significantly higher bacterial burden in the brain.

733,733,Prospects for the prevention of bacterial meningitis with polysaccharide vaccines.,MOST SUPPURATIVE INFECTIONS OF THE MENINGES ARE CAUSED BY FIVE BACTERIAL SPECIES: Escherichia coli Haemophilus influenzae type b Streptococcus pneumoniae Neisseria meningitidis and group B streptococcus. The immune response of adults to pneumococcal capsular polysaccharides has been studied in great detail and their responses to meningococcal and H. influenzae type b capsular polysaccharides are quite similar. Immune responses of adults to E. coli and group B streptococcal antigens are disappointing. The responses of children below the age of 7 years differ both quantitatively and in duration. Early experience shows that useful antibody titres can be achieved with certain antigens but further studies are required. In order to prevent bacterial meningitis by immunization three vaccine formulations will need to be developed. When epidemic meningococcal disease occurs in a population the vaccine containing only components of the meningococcus would be applied to a large segment of the population to terminate the epidemic. The second vaccine would contain components of H. influenzae type b pneumococcus and the meningococcus and would be administered in the first year of life and repeated at suitable intervals to maintain life-long immunity.

The immune response of adults to pneumococcal capsular polysaccharides has been studied in great detail and their responses to meningococcal and H. influenzae type b capsular polysaccharides are quite similar. Immune responses of adults to E. coli and group B streptococcal antigens are disappointing. The responses of children below the age of 7 years differ both quantitatively and in duration. Early experience shows that useful antibody titres can be achieved with certain antigens but further studies are required. In order to prevent bacterial meningitis by immunization three vaccine formulations will need to be developed. When epidemic meningococcal disease occurs in a population the vaccine containing only components of the meningococcus would be applied to a large segment of the population to terminate the epidemic. The second vaccine would contain components of H. influenzae type b pneumococcus and the meningococcus and would be administered in the first year of life and repeated at suitable intervals to maintain life-long immunity. The third vaccine designed to prevent neonatal meningitis caused by E. coli K1 and group B streptococci would be administered to women preferably during the third trimester of pregnancy so that their offspring would inherit sufficient antibodies to protect them during the first 3 months of life.The vaccine against the meningococcus is a reality and has been used extensively during major epidemics with excellent results.

METHODS: The phenotype and percentage of circulating alpha beta and gamma delta T-cell receptor-bearing lymphocytes were determined from patients with bacterial meningitis (Haemophilus influenzae Streptococcus pneumoniae and Neisseria meningitidis) patients with bacterial infection but without meningitis and healthy control subjects by a monoclonal antibody staining method. The in vitro production of cytokines interleukins (IL-2 IL-6) interferon-gamma and tumor necrosis factor-alpha was measured by the bioassay or ELISAs. RESULTS: The percentage of circulating gamma delta T cells with a CD3+CD4+CD8- phenotype was significantly (p < 0.001) increased in all patients with bacterial meningitis compared with patients with bacterial infection and healthy control subjects. The CD3+ gamma delta T cells from patients with meningitis produced highly elevated levels of two proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-alpha and IL-6.

738,738,Quality assurance study of bacterial antigen testing of cerebrospinal fluid.,Bacterial antigen testing (BAT) of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) by latex agglutination is a low-yield procedure in patients whose CSF specimens have normal laboratory parameters. Between August 1992 and August 1994 we evaluated 287 bacterial antigen (BA) test requests to determine whether yields could be improved and whether patient costs could be reduced by cancelling BAT for those patients with normal CSF parameters (cell count protein glucose) after consultation with physicians. A total of 171 (68%) BA tests were canceled by this approach. None of these CSF specimens was culture positive for an organism detectable by BAT. Of the remaining 116 CSF specimens tested only 3 were positive by BAT one each for Neisseria meningitidis Streptococcus pneumoniae and group B streptococcus. Only 43 of the CSF specimens tested had at least two abnormal parameters; the 3 positive CSF specimens were included in this group. In light of the low rate of positivity the number of BA tests can be further reduced by establishing criteria that must be met before a CSF specimen is accepted for BAT. After review of our data and the literature concerning this topic we concluded that only specimens with leukocyte counts of > or = 50 cells per mm3 should be tested. Of 287 specimens evaluated in our study only 36 met this criterion including the 3 BA-positive specimens.

Although several PCR methods have been described for these bacteria the specificity is an underestimated problem. Here we present a quantitative multiplex real-time PCR (qmPCR) for detection of S. pneumoniae (9802 gene fragment) H. influenzae (omp P6 gene) and N. meningitidis (ctrA gene). The method was evaluated on bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples from 156 adults with lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) and 31 controls and on 87 cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from meningitis patients. RESULTS: The analytical sensitivity was not affected by using a combined mixture of reagents and a combined DNA standard (S. pneumoniae/H. influenzae/N. meningitidis) in single tubes. By blood- and BAL-culture and S. pneumoniae urinary antigen test S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae were aetiological agents in 21 and 31 of the LTRI patients respectively. These pathogens were identified by qmPCR in 52 and 72 of the cases respectively yielding sensitivities and specificities of 95% and 75% for S. pneumoniae and 90% and 65% for H. influenzae respectively. When using a cut-off of 10⁵ genome copies/mL for clinical positivity the sensitivities and specificities were 90% and 80% for S. pneumoniae and 81% and 85% for H. influenzae respectively. Of 44 culture negative but qmPCR positive for H. influenzae 41 were confirmed by fucK PCR as H. influenzae.

753,753,Reverse passive haemagglutination (RPHA) test for detection of mycobacterial antigen in the cerebrospinal fluid for diagnosis of tubercular meningitis.,BACKGROUND: Various serological techniques have been developed to detect antibodies and antigens in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for diagnosis of tubercular meningitis. Most of the serological assays are ELISA based. Attempts have been made to use much simpler antigen detection techniques like the reverse passive haemagglutination (RPHA)which is simple and cost-effective. AIMS: To evaluate the reverse passive haemagglutination (RPHA) test for detection of mycobacterial antigens in the CSF for diagnosis of tubercular meningitis. METHODS: In the present study we have made the use of polyclonal antiserum against heat killed whole Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacilli to sensitize the RBCs in RPHA to detect antigens in clinically suspected cases. A total of 46 cases (clinically suspected TBM 24 culture proven TBM 2 non- TBM cases 20) were included in the present study for detecting M. tuberculosis antigen in the CSF specimens. RESULTS: Of the 26 test CSF specimens 13 CSF specimens were positive by RPHA while 4 of the 20 control CSF specimens were also reactive. Two culture positive specimens included in the study were positive by RPHA. Of the 4 control CSF specimens positive by RPHA 3 were culture proven cases of pneumococcal meningitis and 1 was a case of cryptococcal meningitis. The RPHA is found to be 50% sensitive and 80% specific; and showed a 76.4 % positive predictive value and a 55.2 % negative predictive value. CONCLUSION: The RPHA is a simple test that could be used as an adjunct in diagnosing TBM. It does not require any special equipment or technically trained or skilled manpower. It is economical and can be afforded for use in community where TBM is more prevalent. Even though the present study showed a poor sensitivity and specificity further identification characterization and evaluation of better immuno-dominant and specific antigens or epitopes and the usage of antibodies developed against such mycobacterial antigens might improve the sensitivity and specificity of this test.['Journal Article']None,FALSE,Reverse passive haemagglutination (RPHA) test for detection of mycobacterial antigen in the cerebrospinal fluid for diagnosis of tubercular meningitis.BACKGROUND: Various serological techniques have been developed to detect antibodies and antigens in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for diagnosis of tubercular meningitis.

Even though the present study showed a poor sensitivity and specificity further identification characterization and evaluation of better immuno-dominant and specific antigens or epitopes and the usage of antibodies developed against such mycobacterial antigens might improve the sensitivity and specificity of this test.['Journal Article']None,FALSE,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 753}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 753}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 753}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 753}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 753}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 753}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 753}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 753}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 753}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 753}",1

RESULTS: According to records a total of 1144 CSF samples were investigated between November 1999 and June 2000 of which two hundred and twenty two specimens (19.4%) had a positive bacterial or fungal culture. Fifty five of the isolates were from children (aged less than 15 years) and were; 20 (36.4%) were Streptococcus pneumoniae 12(21.8%) were Cryptococcus neoformans and nine (16.4%) were Haemophilus influenzae type b.

Early diagnosis of CSF leakage may change treatment decisions and minimize the risk of meningitis and encephalitis. β2TRNSF is a protein present exclusively in CSF. Its detection is highly useful in cases of CSF leakage although it has never been examined in the presence of central nervous system infection. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective patient analysis. METHODS: Sterile CSF drawn from patients was contaminated in vitro with several microorganisms chosen for their ability to cause neurosurgical-related infections: Streptococcus pneumoniae methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus Staphylococcus epidermidis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. β2TRNSF was examined at two time points: following immediate inoculation (t0) and following an overnight incubation (t18) over various bacterial concentrations. Samples of CSF inoculated with S pneumoniae were also examined in the presence of ciprofloxacin. For β2TRNSF analysis we used immunoblotting electrophoresis and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: CSF samples collected from nine patients were analyzed. β2TRNSF was not detected following S pneumoniae inoculation at both time points when immunoblotting electrophoresis was used. Quantitative analysis using ELISA demonstrated significant β2TRNSF concentration decrease. The addition of ciprofloxacin led to the same results. CONCLUSIONS: CSF leak detection using β2TRNSF may be deceiving in the presence of a S pneumoniae cerebral nervous system infection.

Before implementation of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in developing countries there is an urgent need to provide regional epidemiological data on pneumococcal disease. The aims of this study were to determine the prevalence and serotype distribution of invasive pneumococcal disease among young children hospitalized in urban Nepal. METHODS: Children aged 2 months to 5 years who were admitted to Patan Hospital Kathmandu with fever and/or suspected pneumonia meningitis or bacteremia were recruited. Blood culture specimens were collected from all participants. In cases of suspected meningitis cerebrospinal fluid specimens were cultured and were tested for S. pneumoniae antigen. RESULTS: A total of 885 children were recruited during the 21-month study period. Of these 76 (9%) had meningitis and 498 (56%) had pneumonia on the basis of clinical criteria. Radiographically confirmed pneumonia occurred in 354 (40%) and probable or definite meningitis occurred in 47 (5%). S. pneumoniae was isolated in specimens from 17 (2%) of the children.

763,763,The pavA gene of Streptococcus pneumoniae encodes a fibronectin-binding protein that is essential for virulence.,"Streptococcus pneumoniae colonizes the nasopharynx in up to 40% of healthy subjects and is a leading cause of middle ear infections (otitis media) meningitis and pneumonia. Pneumococci adhere to glycosidic receptors on epithelial cells and to immobilized fibronectin but the bacterial adhesins mediating these reactions are largely uncharacterized. In this report we describe a novel pneumococcal protein PavA which binds fibronectin and is associated with pneumococcal adhesion and virulence. The pavA gene present in 64 independent isolates of S. pneumoniae tested encodes a 551 amino acid residue polypeptide with 67% identical amino acid sequence to Fbp54 protein in Streptococcus pyogenes. PavA localized to the pneumococcal cell outer surface as demonstrated by immunoelectron microscopy despite lack of conventional secretory or cell-surface anchorage signals within the primary sequence. Full-length recombinant PavA polypeptide bound to immobilized human fibronectin in preference to fluid-phase fibronectin in a heparin-sensitive interaction and blocked binding of wild-type pneumococcal cells to fibronectin. However a C-terminally truncated PavA' polypeptide (362 aa residues) failed to bind fibronectin or block pneumococcal cell adhesion. Expression of pavA in Enterococcus faecalis JH2-2 conferred > sixfold increased cell adhesion levels to fibronectin over control JH2-2 cells. Isogenic mutants of S. pneumoniae either abrogated in PavA expression or producing a 42 kDa C-terminally truncated protein showed up to 50% reduced binding to immobilized fibronectin.

Pneumococci adhere to glycosidic receptors on epithelial cells and to immobilized fibronectin but the bacterial adhesins mediating these reactions are largely uncharacterized. In this report we describe a novel pneumococcal protein PavA which binds fibronectin and is associated with pneumococcal adhesion and virulence. The pavA gene present in 64 independent isolates of S. pneumoniae tested encodes a 551 amino acid residue polypeptide with 67% identical amino acid sequence to Fbp54 protein in Streptococcus pyogenes. PavA localized to the pneumococcal cell outer surface as demonstrated by immunoelectron microscopy despite lack of conventional secretory or cell-surface anchorage signals within the primary sequence. Full-length recombinant PavA polypeptide bound to immobilized human fibronectin in preference to fluid-phase fibronectin in a heparin-sensitive interaction and blocked binding of wild-type pneumococcal cells to fibronectin. However a C-terminally truncated PavA' polypeptide (362 aa residues) failed to bind fibronectin or block pneumococcal cell adhesion. Expression of pavA in Enterococcus faecalis JH2-2 conferred > sixfold increased cell adhesion levels to fibronectin over control JH2-2 cells. Isogenic mutants of S. pneumoniae either abrogated in PavA expression or producing a 42 kDa C-terminally truncated protein showed up to 50% reduced binding to immobilized fibronectin.

The South Asian Pneumococcal Alliance (SAPNA) network in Nepal is generating local epidemiological data to assist in the development of national and regional policies for prevention of pneumococcal and Haemophilus influenzae (Hib) disease. METHODS: Children aged 2 months to 5 years with suspected invasive bacterial disease were recruited from Kanti Children Hospital Kathmandu Nepal. Specimens of blood CSF and normally sterile body fluids were cultured and analysis of antimicrobial susceptibility patterns and serotyping of Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates were performed. CSF specimens were also tested for S. pneumoniae and Hib antigens by a latex agglutination test and an immunochromatographic test of pneumococcal antigen (NOW S. pneumoniae Antigen Test; Binax). RESULTS: A total of 2528 children with suspected invasive bacterial disease were recruited of whom 82% had pneumonia 9.6% had meningitis 2% had very severe disease and 0.4% had bacteremia; the remainder received another diagnosis. Before hospitalization 26.7% had received antibiotic treatment. Fifty children had S. pneumoniae identified as the etiological agent of invasive disease. Of 2461 blood cultures performed 22 were positive for S. pneumoniae. Of 33 cases of S. pneumoniae meningitis 11 were detected by CSF culture and 21 were detected by latex agglutination and pneumococcal antigen tests. The rate of detection of S. pneumoniae in CSF was 3.6% by culture compared with 7.8% by latex agglutination and 10% by pneumococcal antigen testing. The rate of detection of H. influenzae in CSF was 1.7% by culture and 6.5% by latex agglutination. The most common serotypes found were 1 5 2 and 7F followed by 12A 19B and 23F.

Human immunity to pneumococcal infections has been assumed to depend on anticapsular antibodies. However recent findings from murine models suggest that alternative mechanisms dependent on T helper cells are also involved. Although the immunological events in which T helper cells contribute to acquired immunity have been studied in mice little is known about how these responses are generated in humans. Therefore we examined bacterial and host factors involved in the induction of Th1 and Th17 responses using a coculture model of human monocytes and CD4(+) T cells. We show that monocytes promote effector cytokine production by memory T helper cells leading to a mixed Th1/Th17 (gamma interferon [IFN-γ]/interleukin-17 [IL-17]) profile. Both T helper cytokines were triggered by purified pneumococcal peptidoglycan; however the balance between the two immune effector arms depended on bacterial viability.

However these apparently harmless bacteria have also a high virulence potential and are known as the etiologic agent of respiratory and life-threatening invasive diseases. Dissemination of pneumococci from the nasopharynx into the lungs or bloodstream leads to community-acquired pneumonia septicaemia and meningitis.

We aimed to determine the prevalence and antibiotic susceptibility patterns of bacterial pathogens causing urinary tract infections (UTIs) and sepsis in a cohort of 219 HIV-infected Jamaican children. METHODS: This cross-sectional study examined clinical and microbiological data for children enrolled in the Kingston Paediatric/Perinatal HIV/AIDS programme from September 1 2002 to May 31 2007. Cases were defined as physician-diagnosed laboratory confirmed UTIs and sepsis based on Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) criteria. Only isolates from urine blood and sterile sites were considered. RESULTS: Forty-four patients (20.1%) accounted for 74 episodes of UTIs and sepsis. Mean number of infections was 1.7 +/- 1.3 per patient. There were 31 males (70.5%) and mean age at time of infection was 5.6 +/- 4.7 years. Bacterial infections comprised cystitis (n = 52 70.3%) bacterial pneumonia (n = 15 20.3%) meningitis (n = 4 5.4%) septicaemia (n = .2 2.7%) and bone infection (n = 1 1.4%). Among 52 UTIs 39 were caused by a single organism. The most common UTI isolates included Escherichia coli (n = 21 53.8%) and Enterobacter spp (n = 5 12.8%). Among 22 cases of sepsis isolates included Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 8 36.4%) and coagulase negative Staphylococcus (n = 6 27.3%). All E coli isolates at two of three clinical sites were resistant to cotrimoxazole. There were 79.7% (n = 51) of infectious episodes with a cotrimoxazole-resistant organism occurring among those on cotrimoxazole prophylaxis.

Penicillin resistance in S. pneumoniae depends in part upon MurM an aminoacyl-tRNA ligase that attaches L-serine or L-alanine to the stem peptide lysine of Lipid II in cell wall peptidoglycan. To investigate the exact substrates the translation machinery provides MurM quality control by alanyl-tRNA synthetase (AlaRS) was investigated. AlaRS mischarged serine and glycine to tRNA(Ala) as observed in other bacteria and also transferred alanine serine and glycine to tRNA(Phe). S. pneumoniae tRNA(Phe) has an unusual U4:C69 mismatch in its acceptor stem that prevents editing by phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase (PheRS) leading to the accumulation of misaminoacylated tRNAs that could serve as substrates for translation or for MurM. Although the peptidoglycan layer of S. pneumoniae tolerates a combination of both branched and linear muropeptides deletion of MurM results in a reversion to penicillin sensitivity in strains that were previously resistant. However because MurM is not required for cell viability the reason for its functional conservation across all strains of S. pneumoniae has remained elusive. We now show that MurM can directly function in translation quality control by acting as a broad specificity lipid-independent trans editing factor that deacylates tRNA. This activity of MurM does not require the presence of its second substrate Lipid II and can functionally substitute for the activity of widely conserved editing domain homologues of AlaRS termed AlaXPs proteins which are themselves absent from S. pneumoniae.['Journal Article' ""Research Support U.S. Gov't Non-P.H.S.""]None",FALSE,"Lipid II-independent trans editing of mischarged tRNAs by the penicillin resistance factor MurM.Streptococcus pneumoniae is a causative agent of nosocomial infections such as pneumonia meningitis and septicemia.

The polysaccharide capsule of these bacteria is an essential virulence determinant and antibodies to it are protective suggesting that a polysaccharide vaccine could prevent these diseases. The young child is however unable to respond with antibody production to these polysaccharides making such vaccines useless in infancy. Conjugation of the polysaccharide to a protein carrier has proven a way to solve the problem. Immunization of infants with such a Hib conjugate vaccine was shown in 1987 to result in the desired antibody production and protection from Hib meningitis and bacteremia. The Hib vaccine is now a part of national infant immunization programs in large parts of Europe the Americas and Australia and has resulted in the virtual disappearance of Hib disease from these areas. A group C meningococcal and 7-valent pneumococcal vaccine available since 2000 are likewise proving highly effective in preventing bacteremic disease. Further advantages of the conjugate vaccines are their ability to elicit immunologic memory and to reduce asymptomatic carriage of the bacteria resulting in marked herd immunity.

The prevention and treatment of this infection have become a top priority for the medical-scientific community. The present polysaccharide-based vaccine used to immunize susceptible hosts is only approximately 60% effective and is ineffective in children younger than 2 years of age. The new conjugate vaccine based on the engineered diphtheria toxin coupled to polysaccharide antigens. is approved only for use in children under 2 years of age to treat invasive disease. While penicillin is the drug of choice to treat infections secondary to S. pneumoniae increasing numbers of bacterial strains are resistant to penicillin as well as to broad spectrum antibiotics such as vancomycin. Thus there is a need to identify new strategies to prevent and treat diseases caused by to S. pneumoniae. In this article we summarize the utilization of the recently available S. pneumoniae genomic information in order to identify and characterize novel proteins likely located on the surface of this Gram-positive pathogenic bacterium. Because only a limited number of surface proteins of S. pneumoniae have been characterized to date this information provides new insights into the pathogenesis of this organism as well as highlights possible avenues for its treatment and/or prevention in the future. The review is divided into two sections. First we brietly summarize current information about known surface-exposed proteins of S. pneumoniae. This is followed by the illustration of procedures for the identification of new putative surface-exposed proteins. These have signal peptides required for their extra-cytoplasmic transport and/or additional signature sequences. Some of these will be S. pneumoniae virulence factors. The signature sequences we have chosen are those leading to protein binding to choline present on the bacterial surface attachment to peptidoglycan of the cell wall or anchoring to lipids of the cytoplasmic membrane. All these signatures are indicative of binding of proteins to the surface of this organism. Secondly we illustrate the application of bioinformatics and modeling tools to these selected proteins in order to provide information about their likely functions and preliminary three-dimensional structure models. The focal point of the analysis of these proteins their sequences and structures is the evaluation of their antigenic properties and possible roles in pathogenicity.

To study the current meningitis burden we evaluated the common bacterial isolates and clinical outcome of the disease in the region. METHODS: We conducted a hospital-based prospective study on 1352 children aged between 7 days and 12 years admitted in pediatric wards at Morogoro Regional Referral Hospital for 7 months. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for laboratory microbiological examination was collected by lumbar puncture in 72 children with signs and symptoms of meningitis. Latex agglutination test was used to confirm the bacterial colonies in the culture. Chi-square test was used for relative risk with 95% confidence intervals; statistical analysis and tests were considered statistically significant when P < 0.05. RESULTS: Among 72 CSF samples 23 (31.9%) were positive for Streptococcus pneumoniae 6 (8.3%) for Haemophilus influenzae 5 (6.9%) for Group B Streptococcus 3 (4.2%) for Escherichia coli and 1 (1.4%) was positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Furthermore 34 CSF samples showed no bacteria growth in the culture media. In addition 39 children (54.2%) did not respond to the treatment whereas 79.5% (n = 39) of them died while 20.5% (n = 39) of them were referred to a tertiary hospital. Nevertheless the incidence of meningitis infection was 5.3% (n = 1352) among the admitted children. CONCLUSIONS: S. pneumoniae was the major laboratory-confirmed bacterial isolate associated with meningitis in children.

Pneumococcal surface protein A (PspA) is a well-characterized virulence factor localized on the surface and a target for vaccine development. In this study we screened a single-chain antibody variable fragment (scFv) using phage display from a human synthetic library to select a clone 2B11. Affinity (K(d)) of 2B11 was measured to be 5 nM using biolayer interferometry. 2B11 exhibited a dose-dependent recognition of recombinant PspA with no cross-reactivity towards pneumococcal antigens. The epitope on PspA was defined to residues 231-242 by mutational analysis. Molecular docking analysis supported the experimentally determined epitope suggesting that the helix spanning residues 231-242 can bind to 2B11 with residues in the CDR-H3 (complementarity determining region 3 in the heavy chain) actively participating in the molecular contacts. Comparison of 2B11 with a commercial PspA antibody revealed that 2B11 exhibited a better specificity towards recombinant PspA antigen. 2B11 was capable of detecting endogenous PspA from pneumococcal lysates with affinity similar to that of the commercial antibody.

811,811,RNA thermosensors facilitate Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae immune evasion.,"Bacterial meningitis is a major cause of death and disability in children worldwide. Two human restricted respiratory pathogens Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae are the major causative agents of bacterial meningitis attributing to 200 000 deaths annually. These pathogens are often part of the nasopharyngeal microflora of healthy carriers. However what factors elicit them to disseminate and cause invasive diseases remain unknown. Elevated temperature and fever are hallmarks of inflammation triggered by infections and can act as warning signals to pathogens. Here we investigate whether these respiratory pathogens can sense environmental temperature to evade host complement-mediated killing. We show that productions of two vital virulence factors and vaccine components the polysaccharide capsules and factor H binding proteins are temperature dependent thus influencing serum/opsonophagocytic killing of the bacteria. We identify and characterise four novel RNA thermosensors in S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae responsible for capsular biosynthesis and production of factor H binding proteins. Our data suggest that these bacteria might have independently co-evolved thermosensing abilities with different RNA sequences but distinct secondary structures to evade the immune system.['Journal Article' ""Research Support Non-U.S. Gov't""]None",FALSE,"RNA thermosensors facilitate Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae immune evasion.Bacterial meningitis is a major cause of death and disability in children worldwide.

812,812,Vertebral osteomyelitis as a hidden cause of persistent meningeal irritation in a patient with pneumococcal meningitis: A case report.,RATIONALE: Pneumococcal meningitis generally develops from bacteremia and is often complicated by multiple organ infection. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 62-year-old man with no previous medical history developed progressive disturbance of consciousness preceded by high-grade fever and headache for a few days. DIAGNOSIS: The patient was diagnosed with pneumococcal meningitis based on meningeal irritation polymorphonuclear cell-predominant pleocytosis of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and a positive pneumococcal urinary antigen test at a different hospital. Despite the administration of meropenem and vancomycin his consciousness worsened and the patient was transferred to our hospital. Marked nuchal stiffness was noted. The patient showed a disturbance of consciousness with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of E3V2M5. No significant cranial nerve palsy motor weakness or sensory impairment was observed. CSF examination showed polynuclear cell-predominant pleocytosis of 755/μL. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed infectious endocarditis. INTERVENTIONS: After the detection of penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae the antibiotic regimen was changed to aminobenzylpenicillin 12 g/d and ceftriaxone 4 g/d which improved the patient's consciousness and CSF findings. However marked neck stiffness and neck pain persisted; we performed a systemic investigation that revealed cervical vertebral osteomyelitis and aortic aneurysm.

The assay an indirect sandwich technique uses polystyrene balls as a solid phase and an alkaline phosphatase-labeled goat anti-rabbit globulin conjugate. Specimens are incubated with polystyrene balls armed with burro anti-HI(b) antiserum and recognition antibody is visualized by addition of alkaline phosphatase-labeled anti-globulin together with the enzyme substrate p-nitrophenyl phosphate. Concentrations of antigen are determined from standard curves prepared by using purified HI(b) capsular antigen polyribophosphate. The assay reproducibly detects polyribophosphate at concentrations between 1 and 5 ng/ml. Cross-reactions have not as yet been encountered in simulated and authentic clinical specimens containing other species including Escherichia coli Klebsiella pneumoniae group B Streptococcus Pseudomonas aeruginosa Streptococcus pneumoniae Staphylococcus aureus Neisseria meningitidis and Listeria monocytogenes. In preliminary tests with 11 spinal fluid specimens 2 serum specimens and 5 urine specimens from patients with culture-proved HI(b) meningitis antigen was detected in all specimens in concentrations ranging from 1 to 7 000 ng/ml. Antigen was not detected in any of 62 clinical specimens which were culture negative for HI(b) including 11 spinal fluid specimens from patients with bacterial meningitis caused by microorganisms other than HI(b). The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique described here is considerably simpler than radioimmunoassay and based on concurrent tests with 14 positive clinical specimens may be more sensitive than counterimmunoelectrophoresis.

832,832,A randomized study comparing the safety and immunogenicity of a conjugate vaccine combination containing meningococcal group C and pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide--CRM197 with a meningococcal group C conjugate vaccine in healthy infants: challenge ph,BACKGROUND: A combination nonavalent pneumococcal-group C meningococcal conjugate vaccine (Pnc9-MenC) was previously found to be safe and immunogenic when administered to infants at 2 3 and 4 months. This study describes the persistence of immunity at 12 months of age and the immunologic response to a challenge dose of either meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine (Meningivac A+C; MnA+C) or MenC. METHODS: A phase II randomized controlled trial of healthy infants. Subjects were given Pnc9-MenC or MenC vaccine at 2 3 and 4 months of age and then challenged with either MenC or MnA+C. Group C meningococcal immunogenicity was measured by serum bactericidal assay (SBA) and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) adapted to measure antibody avidity pre- and post-challenge. RESULTS: The MenC vaccine was more immunogenic than the Pnc9-MenC vaccine in persistence of serogroup C meningococcal polysaccharide antibodies at 12 months of age. Post-challenge at 13 months there were significant differences between the four groups in the induction of serogroup C meningococcal polysaccharide antibodies. The responses to MenC/MenC were significantly higher than in the other groups (p<0.001) and the responses to Pnc9-MenC/MnA+C were significantly lower than in the other groups (p<0.001). There was no difference between the four groups in the proportions with geometric mean concentrations (GMC) greater than 2 microg/ml (p=0.18) or with SBA titres greater than or equal to the protective level of 1:8 (p=0.89). The SBA geometric mean ratio (GMR) between pre- and post-challenge was higher in the groups challenged with MenC than those challenged with MnA+C. Antibody avidity increased over time. CONCLUSION: We have shown that Pnc9-MenC primes effectively for immunological memory. At 13 months of age the highest immune responses were seen in the subjects primed and challenged with MenC alone. However all groups achieved the threshold levels required for protection.['Clinical Trial Phase II' 'Comparative Study' 'Journal Article' 'Randomized Controlled Trial']None,FALSE,A randomized study comparing the safety and immunogenicity of a conjugate vaccine combination containing meningococcal group C and pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide--CRM197 with a meningococcal group C conjugate vaccine in healthy infants: challenge phBACKGROUND: A combination nonavalent pneumococcal-group C meningococcal conjugate vaccine (Pnc9-MenC) was previously found to be safe and immunogenic when administered to infants at 2 3 and 4 months.

835,835,Follistatin (FS) in human cerebrospinal fluid and regulation of FS expression in a mouse model of meningitis.,"OBJECTIVE: Follistatin (FS) is the specific binding protein of activin and expression of both factors is regulated by inflammatory agents. Therefore FS concentrations were determined in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with bacterial and viral meningitis or multiple sclerosis (MS) as well as in the CSF of patients without meningial inflammation or autoimmune diseases. Furthermore a mouse pneumococcal meningitis model was used to localise the cellular sources of FS in brains of normal and meningitic mice. METHODS: FS concentrations in CSF were determined by ELISA; FS in mice was localised by in situ hybridisation and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: FS concentrations were > or =0.4 microg/l in 22 of 66 CSF samples of meningitis patients versus 2 of 27 CSF samples from patients with multiple sclerosis (P<0.05) and 2 of 41 CSF specimen from patients without neuroinflammatory diseases (P<0.01). In the CSF of patients with meningitis the concentration of FS was correlated with total protein (P<0.005) and lactate concentrations (P<0.05) but not with leukocyte counts interval between onset of disease and CSF analysis or clinical outcome. The CSF-to-serum ratios of FS and albumin also correlated significantly (P<0.0005). In some patients with meningitis the CSF-to-serum ratios suggested that the elevated FS in CSF did not originate from serum alone. FS was localised in mice brains to neurones of the hippocampus dentate gyrus neocortex and to the choroid plexus. Analyses of brains and other organs from uninfected and infected animals sacrificed 6-36 h after infection did not reveal any obvious differences in the distribution and intensity of FS mRNA and protein expression. CONCLUSIONS: The concentration of FS in humans is elevated during meningitis. In some patients the increase is caused by a release of FS from brain into CSF.

The aim of this study is to investigate the expression of nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain 2 (NOD2) and inflammatory factors in rat brain tissues infected with Streptococcus pneumoniae and its influence on the blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability. Rats were given an intracranial injection of Streptococcus pneumoniae to construct the Streptococcus pneumoniae meningitis rat models.

Furthermore the changing processes of pathological characteristics nervous system score cerebral oedema and BBB permeability were observed. Our results showed that NOD2 expression began to increase in the 12 h after Streptococcus pneumoniae infection group while the remaining inflammatory factors were not obviously increased. Meanwhile the levels of NOD2 as well as inflammatory factors IL-1β TNF-α and IL-6 were markedly elevated in 24 h and 48 h infection groups which were consistent with the increases in BBB permeability and BWC and the positive expression of NOD2 in the infected rat brain tissues was observed using immunohistochemistry (IHC). This study suggests that NOD2 might be related to the activation of inflammation pathways and the damage to the blood-brain barrier.

CASE PRESENTATION AND RESULTS: A case is presented of a patient with radiographic evidence of a left lower lobe pneumonia. Sequential transthoracic followed by transesophageal echocardiogram done to evaluate the presence of a cardiac murmur revealed the presence of quadruple valve vegetations. Multiple blood cultures were persistently negative. The patient went on to develop seizures secondary to proven meningitis. Microbiological diagnosis was eventually established through positive Streptococcus pneumoniae antigen (Alere BinaxNOW®) from cerebrospinal fluid establishing a presumptive clinical diagnosis of Austrian syndrome.

838,838,Effect of pH changes in cerebrospinal fluid specimens on bacterial survival and antigen test results.,AIMS: To determine the effect of pH changes occurring in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) after sampling on the viability of meningitis causing bacteria and on the performance of agglutination assays used for the rapid detection of bacterial antigens. METHODS: The pH of CSF collected via lumbar puncture was measured by various methods and the effects of the following different incubation conditions on subsequent changes were determined: air at 4 degrees C; air at room temperature (22 degrees C); air at 37 degrees C; and air with 5% CO2 at 37 degrees C. The growth/survival in pooled CSF of 15 bacterial isolates collected from 74 patients with meningitis was assessed in these incubation conditions over 24 hours. The effects of pH changes in the CSF on the sensitivity of two latex agglutination and one co-agglutination kits for detecting Haemophilus influenzae Neisseria meningitidis groups B and C and Streptococcus pneumoniae were determined. RESULTS: The measured pH of CSF was highly affected by the method used and particularly the time delay between patient sampling and assay. Measured pH values at the time of sampling (mean 7.5) increased rapidly within 60 seconds by about one unit. CSF pH continued to increase during incubation in all tested conditions (up to approximately pH 10) with the exception of in air with 5% CO2 at 37 degrees C where pH changes were reversible and near physiological values were attained. Bacterial survival for all species tested was poorest in CSF incubated in air at 37 degrees C and best following exposure to air with 5% CO2 at 37 degrees C. Agglutination in rapid antigen detection kits with CSF incubated in air as opposed to air with 5% CO2 generally took longer to occur and in some instances was less prominent. In one case a false negative result was obtained with CSF seeded with N meningitidis group B incubated in the former but not the latter conditions. CONCLUSIONS: CSF pH increases after patient sampling are minimised and/or mostly reversed by incubation in an atmosphere containing 5% CO2. CSF samples should ideally be placed in such an atmosphere as soon as possible after collection and left there until laboratory processing occurs to reduce the detrimental effects of pH stress on bacterial survival. pH increases may also reduce the likelihood of obtaining a positive result in rapid antigen detection assays.['Journal Article']None,FALSE,Effect of pH changes in cerebrospinal fluid specimens on bacterial survival and antigen test results.AIMS: To determine the effect of pH changes occurring in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) after sampling on the viability of meningitis causing bacteria and on the performance of agglutination assays used for the rapid detection of bacterial antigens.

839,839,Simultaneous Detection of Five Pathogens from Cerebrospinal Fluid Specimens Using Luminex Technology.,"Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial for the outcome of central nervous system (CNS) infections. In this study we developed a multiplex PCR-Luminex assay for the simultaneous detection of five major pathogens including Mycobacterium tuberculosis Cryptococcus neoformans Streptococcus pneumoniae and herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2 which frequently cause CNS infections. Through the hybridization reaction between multiplex PCR-amplified targets and oligonucleotide ""anti-TAG"" sequences we found that the PCR-Luminex assay could detect as low as 10¹-10² copies of synthetic pathogen DNAs. Furthermore 163 cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimens from patients with suspected CNS infections were used to evaluate the efficiency of this multiplex PCR-Luminex method. Compared with Ziehl-Neelsen stain this assay showed a high diagnostic accuracy for tuberculosis meningitis (sensitivity 90.7% and specificity 99.1%). For cryptococcal meningitis the sensitivity and specificity were 92% and 97.1% respectively compared with the May Grunwald Giemsa (MGG) stain. For herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2 encephalitis the sensitivities were 80.8% and 100% and the specificities were 94.2% and 99% respectively compared with Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) assays. Taken together this multiplex PCR-Luminex assay showed potential efficiency for the simultaneous detection of five pathogens and may be a promising supplement to conventional methods for diagnosing CNS infections.['Journal Article']None",FALSE,"Simultaneous Detection of Five Pathogens from Cerebrospinal Fluid Specimens Using Luminex Technology.Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial for the outcome of central nervous system (CNS) infections.

Furthermore 163 cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimens from patients with suspected CNS infections were used to evaluate the efficiency of this multiplex PCR-Luminex method. Compared with Ziehl-Neelsen stain this assay showed a high diagnostic accuracy for tuberculosis meningitis (sensitivity 90.7% and specificity 99.1%). For cryptococcal meningitis the sensitivity and specificity were 92% and 97.1% respectively compared with the May Grunwald Giemsa (MGG) stain. For herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2 encephalitis the sensitivities were 80.8% and 100% and the specificities were 94.2% and 99% respectively compared with Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) assays. Taken together this multiplex PCR-Luminex assay showed potential efficiency for the simultaneous detection of five pathogens and may be a promising supplement to conventional methods for diagnosing CNS infections.['Journal Article']None",FALSE,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 839}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 839}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 839}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 839}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 839}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 839}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 839}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 839}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 839}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 839}",1
840,840,Impact of the introduction of the Haemophilus influenzae type b conjugate vaccine in an urban setting in southern India.,"INTRODUCTION: Haemophilus influenzae type b was the leading cause of bacterial meningitis in infants and children below the age of two years prior to the introduction of H. influenzae type b conjugate vaccines. In December 2011 the Indian government introduced H. influenzae b vaccine in the state of Tamilnadu. A prospective surveillance for bacterial meningitis was established at the Institute of Child Health in Chennai to evaluate the etiology of meningitis and impact of the vaccine. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Infants aged one to 23 months who were admitted to the hospital with symptoms of suspected bacterial meningitis were enrolled and lumbar puncture was performed. Cerebrospinal fluid samples were analyzed for white blood cells protein and glucose. Bacterial culture and a latex agglutination test for common bacterial pathogens were performed. RESULTS: Between January 2009 and March 2014 4 770 children with suspected bacterial meningitis were enrolled. Prior to the introduction of the vaccine an average of 11.7 cases of H. influenzae b meningitis and 31.1 cases of probable meningitis with no etiology were identified each year. After introduction the number of cases were reduced by 79% and 44% respectively. The average H. influenzae b vaccine coverage after introduction was 69% among all children with clinically suspected meningitis. In contrast the mean number of aseptic meningitis and pneumococcal meningitis cases remained stable throughout the pre and post vaccination period; 28.2 and 4.8 per year respectively. CONCLUSIONS: H. influenzae b conjugate vaccine reduced the number of cases of H. influenzae b meningitis and probable meningitis within the first two years of its introduction. The impact against meningitis was higher than the vaccination rate indicating indirect effects of the vaccine. India has recently scaled up the use of Hib conjugate vaccine throughout the country which should substantially reduce childhood meningitis rates further in the country.['Journal Article' ""Research Support Non-U.S. Gov't""]None",FALSE,"Impact of the introduction of the Haemophilus influenzae type b conjugate vaccine in an urban setting in southern India.INTRODUCTION: Haemophilus influenzae type b was the leading cause of bacterial meningitis in infants and children below the age of two years prior to the introduction of H. influenzae type b conjugate vaccines.

This test is efficient in detecting antigens of most common central nervous system bateria but lacks sensibility. Furthermore in the early phases of acute bacterial and viral meningitis signs and symptoms are often non specific and it is not always possible to make a differential diagnosis.

843,843,Decline of childhood Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) disease in the Hib vaccine era.,"OBJECTIVE: Effective Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) conjugate vaccines were first licensed for use in US children at least 18 months old in December 1987 and for infants at least 2 months old in October 1990. We evaluated trends in Hib disease associated with licensure of Hib conjugate vaccines. DESIGN: Data from two sources an intensive laboratory-based active surveillance system and the National Bacterial Meningitis Reporting System (NBMRS) were used separately to evaluate disease incidence. Data from vaccine manufacturers on Hib vaccine doses distributed in the United States were compared with trends in Hib disease incidence. RESULTS: The age-specific incidence of Hib disease among children less than 5 years old decreased by 71% from 37 per 100 000 persons in 1989 to 11 per 100 000 persons in 1991 (active surveillance data). Haemophilus influenzae meningitis incidence decreased by 82% between 1985 and 1991 (NBMRS data). Increases in doses of Hib vaccine distributed in the United States coincided with steep declines in Hib disease. Both surveillance systems showed decreased rates of Hib disease in infants less than 1 year old before vaccine was licensed for use in this age group. Haemophilus influenzae type b disease incidence in persons at least 12 years old and pneumococcal meningitis incidence in children less than 5 years old did not change substantially during the same period; therefore decreased Hib disease in children less than 5 years old is not likely to be explained solely by changes in surveillance sensitivity or decreases in bacterial disease due to changes in medical practice. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that conjugate vaccines have already had a marked impact on the incidence of Hib disease in the United States preventing an estimated 10 000 to 16 000 cases of Hib disease in 1991. The decline of disease in infants less than 1 year old before licensure for this age group warrants further investigation.['Journal Article' ""Research Support U.S. Gov't P.H.S.""]None",FALSE,"Decline of childhood Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) disease in the Hib vaccine era.OBJECTIVE: Effective Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) conjugate vaccines were first licensed for use in US children at least 18 months old in December 1987 and for infants at least 2 months old in October 1990.

Here we show a significant elevation of BPI in Gram-positive meningitis and surprisingly a positive correlation between BPI and pro-inflammatory markers like TNFα. To clarify the underlying mechanisms we identify BPI ligands of Gram-positive origin specifically bacterial lipopeptides and lipoteichoic acids and determine essential structural motifs for this interaction. Importantly the interaction of BPI with these newly defined ligands significantly enhances the immune response in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) mediated by Gram-positive bacteria and thereby ensures their sensitive perception.

Culture-independent methods for detecting S. pneumoniae include PCR and antigen tests. We evaluated an antigen test on blood culture broth for the rapid detection of S. pneumoniae bacteraemia. METHOD: We collected 212 signal-positive blood cultures with gram-positive cocci in pairs chains or with uncertain morphology. The BinaxNOW S. pneumoniae urinary antigen test Gram stain culture and lytA PCR were performed on all samples. Diagnostic accuracy of the antigen test and Gram stain with gram-positive cocci in pairs were compared with culture polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and the composite of culture and PCR. RESULTS: Streptococcus pneumoniae was isolated in 26% of samples 66% cultured other gram-positive organisms and 8% of samples had no growth. Sensitivity and negative predictive values of the antigen test were 100% specificity and positive predictive values were 87% - 88% and 76% - 81% but increased to 93% - 96% and 96% - 98% when applied to subsets with gram-positive cocci in pairs or history compatible with respiratory illness or meningitis. Sensitivity (69% - 75%) and specificity (81%) of Gram stain (gram-positive cocci in pairs) were lower than the antigen test even when applied to the same subsets.

The sensitivities and specificities were 67 and 86 % for Uni-Gold™ and 57 % and 94 % for BinaxNOW® respectively. The false-positivity rate was significantly higher for Uni-Gold™ compared with BinaxNOW® in patients with Escherichia coli bacteremia (15 vs. 2.1 % p = 0.04) and tended to be higher in patients with bacteremia with alpha-hemolytic streptococci (32 vs. 11 % p = 0.13).

849,849,Vancomycin tolerance in clinical and laboratory Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates depends on reduced enzyme activity of the major LytA autolysin or cooperation between CiaH histidine kinase and capsular polysaccharide.,"Vancomycin is frequently added to standard therapy for pneumococcal meningitis. Although vancomycin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae strains have not been isolated reports on the emergence of vancomycin-tolerant pneumococci are a cause of concern. To date the molecular basis of vancomycin tolerance in S. pneumoniae is essentially unknown. We examined two vancomycin-tolerant clinical isolates i.e. a purported autolysin negative (LytA(-)) serotype 23F isolate (strain S3) and the serotype 14 strain 'Tupelo' which is considered a paradigm of vancomycin tolerance. S3 was characterized here as carrying a frameshift mutation in the lytA gene encoding the main pneumococcal autolysin. The vancomycin tolerance of strain S3 was abolished by transformation to the autolysin-proficient phenotype. The original Tupelo strain was discovered to be a mixture: a strain showing a vancomycin-tolerant phenotype (Tupelo_VT) and a vancomycin-nontolerant strain (Tupelo_VNT). The two strains differed only in terms of a single mutation in the ciaH gene present in the VT strain. Most interestingly although the vancomycin tolerance of Tupelo_VT could be overcome by increasing the LytA dosage upon transformation by a multicopy plasmid or by externally adding the autolysin we show that vancomycin tolerance in S. pneumoniae requires the simultaneous presence of a mutated CiaH histidine kinase and capsular polysaccharide.['Journal Article' ""Research Support Non-U.S. Gov't""]None",FALSE,"Vancomycin tolerance in clinical and laboratory Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates depends on reduced enzyme activity of the major LytA autolysin or cooperation between CiaH histidine kinase and capsular polysaccharide.Vancomycin is frequently added to standard therapy for pneumococcal meningitis.

851,851,Biofilm and planktonic pneumococci demonstrate disparate immunoreactivity to human convalescent sera.,BACKGROUND: Streptococcus pneumoniae (the pneumococcus) is the leading cause of otitis media community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) sepsis and meningitis. It is now evident that S. pneumoniae forms biofilms during nasopharyngeal colonization; the former which facilitates persistence the latter a prerequisite for subsequent development of invasive disease. Proteomic evaluation of S. pneumoniae suggests the antigen profile available for host-recognition is altered as a consequence of biofilm growth. This has potentially meaningful implications in regards to adaptive immunity and protection from disseminated disease. We therefore examined the antigen profile of biofilm and planktonic pneumococcal cell lysates tested their reactivity with human convalescent sera and that generated against biofilm pneumococci and examined whether immunization with biofilm pneumococci protected mice against infectious challenge. RESULTS: Biofilm pneumococci have dramatically altered protein profiles versus their planktonic counterparts. During invasive disease the humoral immune response is skewed towards the planktonic protein profile. Immunization with biofilm bacteria does not elicit a strong-cross-reactive humoral response against planktonic bacteria nor confer resistance against challenge with a virulent isolate from another serotype. We identified numerous proteins including Pneumococcal serine-rich repeat protein (PsrP) which may serve as a protective antigens against both colonization and invasive disease. CONCLUSION: Differential protein production by planktonic and biofilm pneumococci provides a potential explanation for why individuals remain susceptible to invasive disease despite previous colonization events. These findings also strongly suggest that differential protein production during colonization and disease be considered during the selection of antigens for any future protein vaccine.['Journal Article' 'Research Support N.I.H.

855,855,Prospective multi-centre sentinel surveillance for Haemophilus influenzae type b & other bacterial meningitis in Indian children.,"BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) is one of the leading bacterial causes of invasive disease in populations without access to Hib conjugate vaccines (Hib-CV). India has recently decided to introduce Hib-CV into the routine immunization programme in selected States. Longitudinal data quantifying the burden of bacterial meningitis and the proportion of disease caused by various bacteria are needed to track the impact of Hib-CV once introduced. A hospital-based sentinel surveillance network was established at four places in the country and this study reports the results of this ongoing surveillance. METHODS: Children aged 1 to 23 months with suspected bacterial meningitis were enrolled in Chennai Lucknow New Delhi and Vellore between July 2008 and June 2010. All cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were tested using cytological biochemical and culture methods. Samples with abnormal CSF (≥10 WBC per μl) were tested by latex agglutination test for common paediatric bacterial meningitis pathogens. RESULTS: A total of 708 patients with abnormal CSF were identified 89 of whom had a bacterial pathogen confirmed. Hib accounted for the majority of bacteriologically confirmed cases 62 (70%) while Streptococcus pneumoniae and group B Streptococcus were identified in 12 (13%) and seven (8%) cases respectively. The other eight cases were a mix of other bacteria. The proportion of abnormal CSF and probable bacterial meningitis that was caused by Hib was 74 and 58 per cent lower at Christian Medical College (CMC) Vellore which had a 41 per cent coverage of Hib-CV among all suspected meningitis cases compared to the combined average proportion at the other three centres where a coverage between 1 and 8 per cent was seen (P<0.001 and P= 0.05 respectively). INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: Hib was found to be the predominant cause of bacterial meningitis in young children in diverse geographic locations in India. Possible indications of herd immunity was seen at CMC compared to sites with low immunization coverage with Hib-CV.

856,856,Evaluation of Pastorex meningitis kit performance for the rapid identification of Neisseria meningitidis serogroup C in Nigeria.,BACKGROUND: Neisseria meningitidis serogroup C (NmC) has caused outbreaks in Nigeria of increasing size in three consecutive years since 2013. Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for meningitis can facilitate quick identification of the causative pathogen; Pastorex can detect N. meningitidis serogroups A C (NmC) Y/W135 N. meningitidis serogroup B/Escherichia coli K1 Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) Streptococcus pneumoniae and group B Streptococcus. There is no published field evaluation of Pastorex in the identification of NmC. We report our experience with Pastorex in detecting NmC in field conditions. METHODS: During sequential outbreaks of NmC in Nigeria in 2013 2014 and 2015 cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was collected from suspected cases of meningitis that met the case definition. Pastorex latex agglutination rapid test was done in the field and trans-isolate media were inoculated with CSF for culture and/or PCR which was used as the reference standard for 63 paired samples. RESULTS: The sensitivity of Pastorex for NmC was 80.0% (95% CI 65.4-90.4%) and the specificity was 94.4% (95% CI 72.7-99.9%). The positive likelihood ratio (LR) was 14.4 (95% CI 2.1-97.3) and negative LR was 0.2 (95% CI 0.1-0.4). The positive and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV) were 97.3% (95% CI 85.8-99.9) and 65.4% (95% CI 44.3-82.8) respectively with a prevalence estimate of 71.4% (95% CI 58.6-82.1). CONCLUSION: Pastorex showed good performance in detecting NmC under field conditions. Prepositioning Pastorex at peripheral health facilities during non-epidemic periods is constrained by a short shelf-life of 1 month after the kit is opened.

Infections of Central Nervous System (CNS) still dominate the scene of childhood neurological disorders in most of the developing tropical countries. AIMS: To isolate identify and determine the antibiotic susceptibility patterns of pathogens associated with bacterial meningitis. We also aimed to comparatively evaluate of Gram staining culture and bacterial antigen detection in cerebrospinal fluid samples. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Present comparative study included 100 CSF samples of children below the age of 5 years who were clinically suspected meningitis cases. The samples were subjected to Gram staining culture and Latex agglutination test (LAT). The organisms isolated in the study were characterized and antibiotic susceptibility test was done according to standard guidelines. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: It was done by using Gaussian test. RESULTS: Of the 100 cases 24 were diagnosed as Acute bacterial meningitis (ABM) cases by. Gram staining culture and latex agglutination test. 21 (87.5%) cases were culture positive with 2 cases being positive for polymicrobial isolates. Gram staining was positive in 17 (70.53%) cases and LAT was positive in 18 (33.33%) cases. Streptococcus pneumoniae was the predominant organism which was isolated and it was sensitive to antibiotics. CONCLUSION: In the present study male to female ratio was 1.27:1 which showed a male preponderance. With the combination of Gram staining culture and LAT 100% sensitivity and specificity can be achieved (p < 0.001). Gram staining and LAT can detect 85% of cases of ABM. Bacterial meningitis is a medical emergency and making an early diagnosis and providing treatment early are life saving and they reduce chronic morbidity.['Journal Article']None,TRUE,"Study of bacterial meningitis in children below 5 years with comparative evaluation of gram staining, culture and bacterial antigen detection.CONTEXT: Bacterial meningitis is one of the most serious infections seen in infants and children which is associated with acute complications and chronic morbidity.

860,860,Feasibility of radioimmunotherapy of experimental pneumococcal infection.,"Streptococcus pneumoniae is an important cause of community-acquired pneumonia meningitis and bacteremia. The problem of pneumococcal disease is exacerbated by increasing drug resistance. Furthermore patients with impaired immunity are at high risk for invasive pneumococcal infections. Thus there is an urgent need for new approaches to antimicrobial therapy. Antibody therapies take advantage of the specificity and high affinity of the antigen-antibody interaction to deliver antibacterial compounds to a site of infection in the form of naked or conjugated antibodies. We have recently established that radioimmunotherapy (RIT) can be used to treat experimental fungal infections in mice. In the present study we investigated the feasibility of applying a RIT approach to the treatment of S. pneumoniae infection by evaluating the susceptibility of S. pneumoniae to radiolabeled antibody in vitro and in an animal infection model. For the specific antibody carrier we used human monoclonal antibody D11 which binds to pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide 8. We have selected the alpha particle emitter (213)Bi as the radionuclide for conjugation to the antibody. Incubation of serotype 8 S. pneumoniae with (213)Bi-D11 resulted in dose-dependent killing of bacteria. RIT of S. pneumoniae infection in C57BL/6 mice showed that 60% more mice survived in the (213)Bi-D11-treated group (80 micro Ci) than in the untreated group (P < 0.01). The treatment did not cause hematological toxicity as demonstrated by platelet counts.

METHOD: Demographic clinical and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) information was collected from the chart of every patient aged 2-59 months whose CSF exam was performed at the CSF Lab - José Silveira Foundation between January 1989 and December 2001. Every CSF exam was completely performed according to standard methods. The etiologic diagnosis was based on either culture and/or latex-agglutination test. When the agent was only seen on Gram stained smear the diagnosis was descriptive. BMUE was defined as: glucose < 40mg / dl protein > 100 mg / dl white blood cell count > 20 cells / mm(3) percentage of neutrophils > 80%. RESULTS: Of 1519 patients 894 (58.9%) had normal exams and BM was diagnosed in 95 (6.2%). Etiologic agents were: Hib (44.2%) meningococcus (13.7%) Gram-negative bacilli (11.6%) Mycobacterium tuberculosis (6.3%) pneumococcus (4.2%) other agents (4.2%); BMUE was diagnosed in 15.8% of cases with BM.

869,869,ASSESSMENT OF THE DIAGNOSTIC AND PROGNOSTIC ROLE OF CEREBEROSPINAL FLUID INTERLEUKIN-8 LEVEL IN ADULT PATIENTS WITH MENINGITIS.,Meningitis necessitates immediate diagnosis and therapy. It is important to distingu- ish bacterial from aseptic meningitis as this help to avoid complications and unnece- ssary antibiotic use. This work assessed the diagnostic and prognostic role of cerebro-spinal fluid interleukin-8 (IL-8) level in adult patients with meningitis. Ninety adult patients with meningitis were studied. They were divided into 3 groups: bacterial tuberculous and aseptic meningitis. Full clinical examination and laboratory workup of meningitis were done. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) IL-8 levels were assessed. Patients were followed up till discharge or death. CSF IL-8 level was significantly higher in bacterial and tuberculous meningitis in comparison to aseptic meningitis. At cut off value 121.77 pg/ml the area under ROC curve was 0.774 with efficacy 69% for differentiating viral from non-viral meningitis. The test efficacy is low in differentiating tuberculous from bactedal meningitis.

Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccines are poorly immunogenic in this highly vulnerable group but protein polysaccharide conjugate vaccines are likely to be more effective. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether immunization of infants with a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine induces immunologic memory. METHODS: Eighty-four Gambian children who had been vaccinated previously with two or three doses of a pentavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (CRM197) or with a Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) conjugate vaccine were immunized when approximately 2 years old with a 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine and a blood sample was obtained 10 days later. Pneumococcal antibody titers in prevaccination and postvaccination sera were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and by an opsonophagocytic assay. RESULTS: On revaccination with a pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine children who had previously received pneumococcal conjugate vaccine had higher antibody concentrations to each of the five polysaccharide components of the conjugate vaccine than did control children. For type 6B polysaccharide which is poorly immunogenic in young children postvaccination antibody concentrations were 0.37 27.6 and 50.9 microg/ml in children who had received no previous pneumococcal immunization or two or three doses of conjugate vaccine respectively.

880,880,Caspase-3 mediates hippocampal apoptosis in pneumococcal meningitis.,"Bacterial meningitis causes neuronal apoptosis in the hippocampal dentate gyrus which is associated with learning and memory impairments after cured disease. The execution of the apoptotic program involves pathways that converge on activation of caspase-3 which is required for morphological changes associated with apoptosis. Here the time course and the role of caspase-3 in neuronal apoptosis was assessed in an infant rat model of pneumococcal meningitis. During clinically asymptotic meningitis (0-12 h after infection) only minor apoptotic damage to the dentate gyrus was observed while the acute phase (18-24 h) was characterized by a massive increase of apoptotic cells which peaked at 36 h. In the subacute phase of the disease (36-72 h) the number of apoptotic cells decreased to control levels. Enzymatic caspase-3 activity was significantly increased in hippocampal tissue of infected animals compared to controls at 22 h. The activated enzyme was localized to immature cells of the dentate gyrus and in vivo activity was evidenced by cleavage of the amyloid-beta precursor protein. Intracisternal administration of the caspase-3-specific inhibitor Ac-DEVD-CHO significantly reduced apoptosis in the hippocampal dentate gyrus. In contrast to a study where the decrease of hippocampal apoptosis after administration of a pan-caspase inhibitor was due to downmodulation of the inflammatory response our data demonstrate that specific inhibition of caspase-3 did not affect inflammation assessed by TNF-alpha and IL-1beta concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid space. Taken together the present results identify caspase-3 as a key effector of neuronal apoptosis in pneumococcal meningitis.['Journal Article' ""Research Support Non-U.S. Gov't"" ""Research Support U.S. Gov't Non-P.H.S.""

Here the time course and the role of caspase-3 in neuronal apoptosis was assessed in an infant rat model of pneumococcal meningitis. During clinically asymptotic meningitis (0-12 h after infection) only minor apoptotic damage to the dentate gyrus was observed while the acute phase (18-24 h) was characterized by a massive increase of apoptotic cells which peaked at 36 h. In the subacute phase of the disease (36-72 h) the number of apoptotic cells decreased to control levels. Enzymatic caspase-3 activity was significantly increased in hippocampal tissue of infected animals compared to controls at 22 h. The activated enzyme was localized to immature cells of the dentate gyrus and in vivo activity was evidenced by cleavage of the amyloid-beta precursor protein. Intracisternal administration of the caspase-3-specific inhibitor Ac-DEVD-CHO significantly reduced apoptosis in the hippocampal dentate gyrus. In contrast to a study where the decrease of hippocampal apoptosis after administration of a pan-caspase inhibitor was due to downmodulation of the inflammatory response our data demonstrate that specific inhibition of caspase-3 did not affect inflammation assessed by TNF-alpha and IL-1beta concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid space. Taken together the present results identify caspase-3 as a key effector of neuronal apoptosis in pneumococcal meningitis.['Journal Article' ""Research Support Non-U.S. Gov't"" ""Research Support U.S. Gov't Non-P.H.S.""

Forty percent of Hib infections in these infants occur before the age of six months when active immunization may not be protective. To evaluate the efficacy of passive immunization with a human hyperimmune globulin (bacterial polysaccharide immune globulin [BPIG]) prepared from the plasma of immunized adult donors we randomly assigned 703 infants in a double-blind fashion to receive 0.5 ml of BPIG per kilogram of body weight (n = 353) or 0.5 ml of saline (n = 350) intramuscularly at 2 6 and 10 months of age. Hib-antibody levels were significantly higher in BPIG recipients than in placebo recipients at 4 6 and 10 months of age (P less than 0.001). During the first 90 days after BPIG or placebo injection no Hib or pneumococcal infections were detected in the BPIG group whereas seven Hib infections (six cases of bacteremia and one of meningitis) and four pneumococcal infections (bacteremia) were detected in the placebo group (P = 0.007 and 0.06 respectively). During the fourth month one case of Hib meningitis and two cases of pneumococcal bacteremia developed in the BPIG group whereas there were no Hib or pneumococcal infections in the placebo group. We conclude that BPIG given at four-month intervals provided significant protection against serious Hib disease for three months and that in high-risk infants it might be used alone perhaps at three-month intervals or together with active immunization.['Clinical Trial' 'Journal Article' 'Randomized Controlled Trial' ""Research Support Non-U.S. Gov't"" ""Research Support U.S. Gov't P.H.S.""]None",FALSE,"Prevention of Haemophilus influenzae type b infections in high-risk infants treated with bacterial polysaccharide immune globulin.Apache Indian infants have a high frequency of Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) and pneumococcal infections.

AIM OF THE STUDY: Quantitation of interleukin-6 in cerebrospinal fluid from patients with purulent bacterial meningitis (PBM) and viral meningitis (VM) on the first day of hospitalization. PATIENTS AND METHODS: IL-6 activity was measured in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 15 children with VM (predominantly 13/15 caused by mumps virus) in age ranging from 2.5 to 15 years and 13 patients with PBM (age ranging from 18 to 52 years). The control group consisted of 10 patients with meningeal syndrome and normal laboratory estimation of CSF (white cells count concentration of glucose and protein). The IL-6 assays were performed using immunoenzymatic method ELISA (Amersham) technique. RESULTS: Increased levels of IL-6 were detected in the CSF of patients with bacterial meningitis and with viral meningitis. CSF IL-6 levels were 6 times greater in patients with purulent bacterial versus viral meningitis. The highest level of IL-6 was observed in a 18 years old patient with pneumococcal meningitis who died. CONCLUSION: We suggest that cytokine levels may be valuable in distinguishing patients with purulent bacterial meningitis from viral meningitis and may help in prognosis of patients with purulent meningitis.['Clinical Trial' 'Controlled Clinical Trial' 'English Abstract' 'Journal Article']None,FALSE,[Levels of interleukin-6 in cerebrospinal fluid of patients with meningitis].Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a multifunctional cytokine that regulates the immune response differentiation of B cells activation of T lymphocytes and acute phase reactions.

887,887,Diagnostic test accuracy of the BioFire® FilmArray® meningitis/encephalitis panel: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,BACKGROUND: The FilmArray® meningitis/encephalitis (ME) panel is a multiplex PCR assay which can detect the most commonly identified pathogens in central nervous system infections. It significantly decreases the time to diagnosis of ME and data has yielded several positive outcomes. However in part reports of both false positive and false negative detections have resulted in concerns about adoption. OBJECTIVES: The aim was to evaluate the ME panel in a diagnostic test accuracy review. DATA SOURCES: The PubMed and EMBASE databases were systematically searched through May 2019. STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Eligible studies were those providing sensitivity and specificity data for the ME panel compared with a reference standard. Studies providing details on false positive and false negative results of the panel as well as further investigation (adjudication) of the discordant results between the panel and comparator assays were included and assessed separately. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with suspected ME for whom a panel was ordered were included. METHODS: The ME panel was compared to reference standard methods for diagnosing community-acquired ME. We performed a meta-analysis and calculated the summary sensitivity and specificity of the ME panel. Moreover we evaluated the false positive and false negative results of the panel. RESULTS: Thirteen studies (3764 patients) were included in the review and 8 of them (3059 patients) were pooled in a meta-analysis. The summary estimates of sensitivity and specificity with 95% confidence intervals (CI) was 90% (95% CI 86-93%) and 97% (95% CI 94-99%) respectively. When we looked specifically at studies that assessed further the false positive and false negative results false positive detections were 11.4% and 4% before and after adjudication respectively. The highest proportion of false positive was observed for Streptococcus pneumoniae followed by Streptococcus agalactiae. False negative isolates were 2.2% and 1.5% before and after adjudication respectively. Herpes simplex virus 1 and 2 enterovirus and Cryptococcus neoformans/gattii had the highest proportions of false negative determinations.

891,891,The diagnostic value of metagenomic next-generation sequencing for identifying Streptococcus pneumoniae in paediatric bacterial meningitis.,BACKGROUND: There is currently no research on the diagnostic value of metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) for a single pathogens in CSF. The aim of this study was to analyse the value of mNGS for identifying Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae) in paediatric bacterial meningitis. METHODS: Bacterial meningitis (BM) cases from October 23 2014 to December 31 2016 and December 1 2017 to July 31 2018 at Beijing Children's Hospital were reviewed. Clinical features and pathogens were analysed. RESULTS: We diagnosed 135 patients with BM in this study. A total of 43 S. pneumoniae were identified by combination methods. 26/135 (19.3%) patients had positive results in S. pneumoniae by blood and/or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) culture. Alere BinaxNow®Streptococcus pneumoniae Antigen test was positive in 35/135(25.9%) cases. 32/135 (23.7%) S. pneumoniae were identified by mNGS. Six CSF samples were identified as S. pneumoniae only by mNGS technology. Taking culture as the gold standard the sensitivity and specificity of mNGS for diagnosing S. pneumoniae meningitis were 73.1 and 88.1% respectively. The positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of diagnosing S. pneumoniae meningitis by mNGS were 59.4 and 93.2% respectively. When comparison between mNGS and combined tests (culture and Alere BinaxNow®Streptococcus pneumoniae Antigen test) the sensitivity and specificity of mNGS for S. pneumoniae identification were 70.3 and 93.9% the PPV and NPV in the identification of S. pneumoniae by mNGS were 81.4 and 89.3% respectively. The difference in number of unique reads of S. pneumoniaein from CSF sample (< 14 days onset) and CSF sample (> 14 days from onset) was statistically significant (170.5 VS. 13 P = 0.019). The difference in the collected time of CSF for culture and mNGS was statistically significant (4 days VS. 14 days P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: mNGS has high sensitivity and specificity for S. pneumoniae identification.

All cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood specimens collected were tested by bacterial culture. Selected culture-negative specimens were tested for Streptococcus pneumoniae by antigen detection or for Haemophilus influenzae Moraxella catarrhalis Neisseria meningitidis and S. pneumoniae by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). RESULTS: A total of 987 children were enrolled (794 with pneumonia 76 with meningitis and 117 with other syndromes consistent with invasive bacterial disease); 84% of children were aged 0-23 months and 57% were male. Seven (0.71%) of 987 blood cultures and 4 (15%) of 26 CSF cultures were positive for any bacterial pathogen (including 6 for H. influenzae type b and 1 for S. pneumoniae).

As such they contribute towards a wide-range of diseases including sub-acute bacterial endocarditis community-acquired pneumonia and meningitis. SRRPs are unique in that they are glycosylated require a non-canonical Sec-translocase for transport and are largely composed of a domain containing hundreds of alternating serine residues. These serine-rich repeats are thought to extend a unique non-repeat (NR) domain outward away from the bacterial surface to mediate adhesion. So far NR domains have been determined to bind to sialic acid moieties keratins or other NR domains of a similar SRRP.

Pneumococcal polysaccharides are not immunogenic in infants but improved immunogenicity of polysaccharide-protein conjugates has been demonstrated. Antibiotic-resistant pneumococci have increased the need for an effective vaccine. OBJECTIVE: To study the safety and immunogenicity of a pneumococcal type 6B polysaccharidetetanus toxoid conjugate (Pn6B-TT) in infants and to assess the function of antibodies. METHODS: Healthy infants were injected Group A at 3 4 and 6 months (n = 21) and Group B at 7 and 9 months (n = 19). Booster injection was given at 18 months. Antibodies were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and radioimmunoassay and functional activity was measured by opsonization of radiolabeled pneumococci. Nasopharyngeal cultures were obtained. RESULTS: No significant adverse reactions were observed. Pn6B-IgG (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) increased to a geometric mean of 0.62 microgram/ml (P = 0.367 compared with prevaccination titers) in Group A at 7 months and 1.22 micrograms/ml (P < 0.001) in Group B at 10 months. Total Pn6B antibodies (radioimmunoassay) were 44 ng of antibody N/ml (P < 0.053) in Group A and 211 ng of antibody N/ml (P < 0.001) in Group B. A smaller increase in IgM and IgA anti-Pn6B was observed. Reinjection at 18 months elicited booster responses in total and IgG anti-Pn6B; 62% of those in Group A and 79% of those in Group B had > 300 ng of antibody N/ml. Opsonic activity after initial and booster vaccinations correlated with Pn6B-antibody titers.

Like many encapsulated pathogens the capsular polysaccharide (CPS) of S. pneumoniae is a critical component for colonization and virulence in mammalian hosts. This study aimed to evaluate the protective role of a glycoside hydrolase Pn3Pase targeting the CPS of type 3 S. pneumoniae which is one of the most virulent serotypes. We have assessed the ability of Pn3Pase to degrade the capsule on a live type 3 strain. Through in vitro assays we observed that Pn3Pase treatment increases the bacterium's susceptibility to phagocytosis by macrophages and complement-mediated killing by neutrophils. We have demonstrated that in vivo Pn3Pase treatment reduces nasopharyngeal colonization and protects mice from sepsis caused by type 3 S. pneumoniae Due to the increasing shifts in serotype distribution the rise in drug-resistant strains and poor immune responses to vaccine-included serotypes it is necessary to investigate approaches to combat pneumococcal infections.

913,913,Comparison of extraction procedures for proteome analysis of Streptococcus pneumoniae and a basic reference map.,"Streptococcus pneumoniae is an important human pathogen causing life-threatening invasive diseases such as pneumonia meningitis and bacteraemia. Despite major advances in our understanding of pneumococcal mechanisms of pathogenicity obtained through genomic studies very little has been achieved on the characterisation of the proteome of this pathogen. The highly complex structure of its cell envelope particularly amongst the various capsular forms enables the cell to resist lysis by conventional mechanical methods. It is therefore highly desirable to develop a cellular lysis and protein solubilisation procedure that minimises protein losses and allows for maximum possible coverage of the proteome of S. pneumoniae. Here we have utilised various combinations of mechanical or enzymatic cell lysis with two protein solubilisation mixtures urea/CHAPS-based mixture or SDS/DTT-based mixture in order to achieve best quality protein profiles using two proteomic technologies surface-enhanced laser desorption ionisation (SELDI) TOF MS and 2-DE. While urea/CHAPS-based mixture combined with freeze/thawing provided enough material for good-quality SELDI TOF MS fingerprints a combination of mechanical enzymatic and chemical lysis was needed to be used to successfully extract the desired protein content for 2-DE analysis. The methods chosen were also assessed for reproducibility and tested on various capsular types of S. pneumoniae. As a result good-quality and reproducible profiles were created using various ProteinChip arrays and more than 800 protein spots were separated on a single 2-D gel of S. pneumoniae. Twenty-five of the most abundant protein spots were identified using LC/MS/MS to create a reference map of S. pneumoniae. The proteins identified included glycolytic enzymes such as glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase phosphoglycerate kinase enolase etc. Several fermentation enzymes were also present including two of the components of the arginine deiminase system.

918,918,Immunity to pneumococcal antigens in kidney transplant recipients.,"BACKGROUND: In immunocompromized patients such as kidney transplant recipients vaccination against Streptococcus pneumoniae is recommended by national guidelines. Streptococcus pneumoniae causes pneumonia and meningitis and is especially harmful after coinfection with influenza virus. The aim of this study was to define whether clinically stable kidney transplant recipients produce normal concentrations of antibodies after pneumococcal vaccination. METHODS: Forty-three consecutive patients were immunized with Pneumovax 23 and antibodies against 14 pneumococcal capsular polysaccharides (serotypes) were determined before and 4 weeks after vaccination. For the first time a commercially available serotype-specific assay (Luminex technology) was used for antibody detection in transplant recipients. RESULTS: After vaccination patients displayed a significant increase (P<0.0001) in total antibody concentration against these 14 serotypes from a median of 12.1 mg/L (range: 2.6-124.0) before vaccination to 51.9 mg/L (4.0-160.7) 4 weeks after vaccination. In addition they showed a significant increase (P<0.0001) in the number of serotypes recognized from a median of 9 (0-13) to 13 (3-14). Antibody responses after vaccination were only slightly lower than in a published cohort of vaccinated healthy controls (total antibody concentration: 61.5 mg/L [patients displayed 84% antibodies of healthy controls]; number of serotypes recognized: 14 (3-14) P=0.003 [Borgers et al. Clin Immunol 2010; 134: 198-205]). Spearman analysis indicated that the estimated glomerular filtration rate at the time of vaccination was significantly (P<0.05) correlated with the increase of antibody concentrations against several polysaccharides.

922,922,Complement deficiency and antibody profile in survivors of meningococcal meningitis due to common serogroups in Italy.,A collaborative survey was carried out in Italy on a group of 59 subjects with a past history of meningococcal meningitis. The aim was to evaluate the prevalence of complement deficiencies the serogroup of meningococci responsible for the disease and other possible immune abnormalities associated with the infection. Complement analysis allowed the detection of 10 cases (17%) with deficiencies of the terminal components and in particular six cases of C8 beta three of C7 and one of C6 defect. Half of the subjects with complement deficiencies had recurrences of meningitis and developed the infection at an older age in comparison with the control group with normal complement activity. The meningococcal C strain was the most diffuse (68%) and infected all the complement-deficient subjects. Evaluation of the antibody response to meningococcal capsular polysaccharides (PS) showed that only 42.5% of the individuals with group C had antibodies as opposed to 83% and 100% of the patients with meningitis due to group A and B respectively. In all 59 subjects serum Ig as well as IgG subclasses were present at normal levels for the age. Vaccination of seven out of the 24 subjects without detectable anti-meningococcal PS antibodies with the sole PS A+C induced a normal response in six of them including a subject with complement defect. In the subject who did not respond to the antigen the antibodies against the ubiquitous pneumococcal PS type 14 were also lacking whereas anti-tetanus toxoid (TT) antibodies were normally present. From these data we may conclude the following: (1) the high prevalence (17%) of late complement components defect among survivors of meningococcal meningitis is also confirmed in the Italian population; (2) the serogroup C responsible for the infections in all the cases with late complement components defect is highly recirculating in Italy and apparently less immunogenic; (3) specific vaccination with meningococcal PS is a valid prophylaxis in subjects with lack of specific antibodies as well as in subjects with complement defect.['Journal Article']None,FALSE,Complement deficiency and antibody profile in survivors of meningococcal meningitis due to common serogroups in Italy.A collaborative survey was carried out in Italy on a group of 59 subjects with a past history of meningococcal meningitis.

From these data we may conclude the following: (1) the high prevalence (17%) of late complement components defect among survivors of meningococcal meningitis is also confirmed in the Italian population; (2) the serogroup C responsible for the infections in all the cases with late complement components defect is highly recirculating in Italy and apparently less immunogenic; (3) specific vaccination with meningococcal PS is a valid prophylaxis in subjects with lack of specific antibodies as well as in subjects with complement defect.['Journal Article']None,FALSE,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 922}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 922}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 922}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 922}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 922}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 922}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 922}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 922}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 922}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 922}",1

924,924,Contribution of capsular and clonal types and beta-lactam resistance to the severity of experimental pneumococcal meningitis.,"We used a rabbit model to assess the effects of capsular serotype genetic background and beta-lactam resistance on the course and severity of experimental meningitis. Meningitis was induced by five pneumococcal strains belonging to five different clones with known invasive potential: two serotype 3 strains (ST260(3) and Netherlands(3)-31 clones) and three serotype 23F strains with different beta-lactam susceptibility patterns (Spain(23F)-1 clone Tennessee(23F)-4 clone and a double locus variant of the Tennessee(23F)-4 clone). Major differences in secondary bacteremia and mortality rates were observed between serotypes 3 and 23F as were divergences in the CSF lactate protein and lipoteichoic-teichoic acid concentrations. Minor differences in the CSF-induced inflammatory response were found among strains belonging to the same serotype. Our results suggest that capsular serotype might be the main factor determining the course and severity of pneumococcal meningitis and genetic background contributes to a lesser extent. The acquisition of beta-lactam resistance does not reduce the virulence of the invasive clones. Since five strains belonging to two serotypes were studied our findings have to be confirmed with other pneumococcal serotypes.['Journal Article' ""Research Support Non-U.S. Gov't""]None",FALSE,"Contribution of capsular and clonal types and beta-lactam resistance to the severity of experimental pneumococcal meningitis.We used a rabbit model to assess the effects of capsular serotype genetic background and beta-lactam resistance on the course and severity of experimental meningitis.

We describe the epidemiology and outcome of bacterial meningitis in Canadian children six years after the introduction of Hib conjugate vaccine and prior to the introduction of the conjugate Streptococcus pneumoniae vaccine. METHODS: A retrospective chart review from January 1998 to December 1999 of children with meningitis identified at eight Canadian tertiary care children's hospitals belonging to the PICNIC network. RESULTS: Bacterial meningitis was documented in 104 (11%) of 970 children presenting with meningitis. The most common isolated organisms were: Streptococcus pneumoniae (54%) group B streptococci (13%) and Neisseria meningitidis (11%). The mean age was 2.2 +/- 3.5 yr. Forty seven percent of the children required admission to Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and 19% required artificial ventilation. Sequelae were documented among 32 children (31%) prior to discharge and there were 6 (5.6%) deaths attributable to meningitis and sepsis. CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial meningitis is an important cause of morbidity in Canadian children with S. pneumoniae replacing H. influenzae as the leading potentially vaccine preventable cause.

Diagnosis is hampered by the ready availability of antibiotics in the community leading to late presentation masked clinical signs and poor organism detection during the microscopical examination and culture of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). In order to improve organism detection at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases in Ho Chi Minh City a diagnostic PCR-based protocol was developed. This protocol was followed in the investigation of CSF samples from 36 patients with clinical signs of bacterial meningitis. Each sample was first tested in a semi-nested PCR using primers for the 16sRNA gene common to all bacteria. The products of this reaction were then amplified using a 16sru8 primer and primers specific for Neisseria meningitidis Haemophilus influenzae or Streptococcus spp. The samples found positive for Streptococcus were further investigated in a nested PCR using primers specific for the pneumolysin gene of S. pneumoniae. The sensitivity of detection was increased from 36% with culture to 44% with PCR. Although the sample size was small the results indicate that PCR would be a feasible and useful adjunct in the diagnosis of bacterial meningitis particularly in areas where community antibiotic use is common.['Journal Article' ""Research Support Non-U.S. Gov't""]None",FALSE,"The role of the polymerase chain reaction in the diagnosis of bacterial meningitis in Vietnam.Bacterial meningitis remains an important cause of morbidity and mortality in Vietnam.

We studied the biallelic interleukin-10-1082 promoter the tumor necrosis factor-alpha-308 promoter and the lymphotoxin-alpha polymorphisms with regard to the development of septic shock in pneumococcal infection. Sixty-nine patients with pneumococcal disease (61 patients with community-acquired pneumonia 5 patients with meningitis and 3 patients with pneumonia and meningitis) and 50 age-matched control subjects were included. The polymorphisms were determined by the polymerase chain reaction. In patients with pneumococcal disease the lipopolysaccharide-stimulated tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-10 release from whole blood were measured by ELISA. Sepsis severity was documented according to standard criteria. No significant genotypic differences were seen between patients and control subjects. Thirteen of 69 patients with pneumococcal disease developed septic shock.

930,930,Disease burden and case management of bacterial meningitis among children under 5 years of age in Saudi Arabia.,OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to explore the case management and disease burden of bacterial meningitis among children below the age of 5 years in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. METHODS: A prospective descriptive study was conducted during June 1999 through to May 2001 in 8 hospitals from 5 cities in different areas of the country. Those were King Fahad Specialist Hospital and Maternity & Children Hospital Buraidah Belgorashi General Hospital and King Fahad Specialist Hospital Al-Baha Maternity & Children Hospital and Ohud Hospital Al-Madina Al-Qatif General Hospital in the Eastern Region and Prince Abdulrahman Bin Ahmed Alsudairy Central Hospital Sakaka. The study population was 171 818 children under the age of 5 years. RESULTS: During the study period 208 cases of bacterial meningitis were identified 141 (67.8%) with a definite causative organism: Hemophilus influenzae type b Neisseria meningitidis Streptococcus pneumoniae and other bacterial species. The remaining 67 cases (32%) were labeled as aseptic meningitis. A considerable proportion of cases was found to have received an antibiotic prior to presentation. While symptoms such as fever or poor feeding were common among cases meningeal signs were less prominent. A lumbar puncture was carried out on all cases to reach diagnosis by gram stain latex agglutination test and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood cultures following standard procedures. The immediate burden of meningitis cases was found to be the lengthy stay of patients in the hospital wards and intensive care units. Some of the main causative agents were resistant to the conventional antimicrobial therapy but susceptible to newer antibiotics. CONCLUSION: The study being based on a population based surveillance gave a better overview on causative organisms of meningitis emphasizing that Gram stain serology of CSF and culture (of CSF and blood) should be used. A high index of suspicion is needed to diagnose meningitis in children. Lumbar tap should be encouraged and supported in terms of training and more authorization to apply in diagnostic tests of such conditions.

931,931,Influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD): an evidence-based review.,: In July 2010 the Medical Advisory Secretariat (MAS) began work on a Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) evidentiary framework an evidence-based review of the literature surrounding treatment strategies for patients with COPD. This project emerged from a request by the Health System Strategy Division of the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care that MAS provide them with an evidentiary platform on the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of COPD interventions. After an initial review of health technology assessments and systematic reviews of COPD literature and consultation with experts MAS identified the following topics for analysis: vaccinations (influenza and pneumococcal) smoking cessation multidisciplinary care pulmonary rehabilitation long-term oxygen therapy noninvasive positive pressure ventilation for acute and chronic respiratory failure hospital-at-home for acute exacerbations of COPD and telehealth (including telemonitoring and telephone support). Evidence-based analyses were prepared for each of these topics. For each technology an economic analysis was also completed where appropriate. In addition a review of the qualitative literature on patient caregiver and provider perspectives on living and dying with COPD was conducted as were reviews of the qualitative literature on each of the technologies included in these analyses. The Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Mega-Analysis series is made up of the following reports which can be publicly accessed at the MAS website at: http://www.hqontario.ca/en/mas/mas_ohtas_mn.html.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this analysis was to determine the effectiveness of the influenza vaccination and the pneumococcal vaccination in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in reducing the incidence of influenza-related illness or pneumococcal pneumonia. CLINICAL NEED: CONDITION AND TARGET POPULATION: INFLUENZA DISEASE: Influenza is a global threat. It is believed that the risk of a pandemic of influenza still exists. Three pandemics occurred in the 20(th) century which resulted in millions of deaths worldwide. The fourth pandemic of H1N1 influenza occurred in 2009 and affected countries in all continents. Rates of serious illness due to influenza viruses are high among older people and patients with chronic conditions such as COPD. The influenza viruses spread from person to person through sneezing and coughing. Infected persons can transfer the virus even a day before their symptoms start. The incubation period is 1 to 4 days with a mean of 2 days. Symptoms of influenza infection include fever shivering dry cough headache runny or stuffy nose muscle ache and sore throat. Other symptoms such as nausea vomiting and diarrhea can occur. Complications of influenza infection include viral pneumonia secondary bacterial pneumonia and other secondary bacterial infections such as bronchitis sinusitis and otitis media. In viral pneumonia patients develop acute fever and dyspnea and may further show signs and symptoms of hypoxia. The organisms involved in bacterial pneumonia are commonly identified as Staphylococcus aureus and Hemophilus influenza. The incidence of secondary bacterial pneumonia is most common in the elderly and those with underlying conditions such as congestive heart disease and chronic bronchitis. Healthy people usually recover within one week but in very young or very old people and those with underlying medical conditions such as COPD heart disease diabetes and cancer influenza is associated with higher risks and may lead to hospitalization and in some cases death. The cause of hospitalization or death in many cases is viral pneumonia or secondary bacterial pneumonia. Influenza infection can lead to the exacerbation of COPD or an underlying heart disease. STREPTOCOCCAL PNEUMONIA: Streptococcus pneumoniae also known as pneumococcus is an encapsulated Gram-positive bacterium that often colonizes in the nasopharynx of healthy children and adults. Pneumococcus can be transmitted from person to person during close contact. The bacteria can cause illnesses such as otitis media and sinusitis and may become more aggressive and affect other areas of the body such as the lungs brain joints and blood stream. More severe infections caused by pneumococcus are pneumonia bacterial sepsis meningitis peritonitis arthritis osteomyelitis and in rare cases endocarditis and pericarditis. People with impaired immune systems are susceptible to pneumococcal infection. Young children elderly people patients with underlying medical conditions including chronic lung or heart disease human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection sickle cell disease and people who have undergone a splenectomy are at a higher risk for acquiring pneumococcal pneumonia. TECHNOLOGY: INFLUENZA AND PNEUMOCOCCAL VACCINES: TRIVALENT INFLUENZA VACCINES IN CANADA: In Canada 5 trivalent influenza vaccines are currently authorized for use by injection. Four of these are formulated for intramuscular use and the fifth product (Intanza(®)) is formulated for intradermal use. The 4 vaccines for intramuscular use are: Fluviral (GlaxoSmithKline) split virus inactivated vaccine for use in adults and children ≥ 6 months; Vaxigrip (Sanofi Pasteur) split virus inactivated vaccine for use in adults and children ≥ 6 months; Agriflu (Novartis) surface antigen inactivated vaccine for use in adults and children ≥ 6 months; and Influvac (Abbott) surface antigen inactivated vaccine for use in persons ≥ 18 years of age. FluMist is a live attenuated virus in the form of an intranasal spray for persons aged 2 to 59 years. Immunization with current available influenza vaccines is not recommended for infants less than 6 months of age. PNEUMOCOCCAL VACCINE: Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccines were developed more than 50 years ago and have progressed from 2-valent vaccines to the current 23-valent vaccines to prevent diseases caused by 23 of the most common serotypes of S pneumoniae. Canada-wide estimates suggest that approximately 90% of cases of pneumococcal bacteremia and meningitis are caused by these 23 serotypes. Health Canada has issued licenses for 2 types of 23-valent vaccines to be injected intramuscularly or subcutaneously: Pneumovax 23(®) (Merck & Co Inc. Whitehouse Station NJ USA) and Pneumo 23(®) (Sanofi Pasteur SA Lion France) for persons 2 years of age and older. Other types of pneumococcal vaccines licensed in Canada are for pediatric use. Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine is injected only once. A second dose is applied only in some conditions. RESEARCH QUESTIONS: 1. What is the effectiveness of the influenza vaccination and the pneumococcal vaccination compared with no vaccination in COPD patients? 2. What is the safety of these 2 vaccines in COPD patients? 3. What is the budget impact and cost-effectiveness of these 2 vaccines in COPD patients?

This project emerged from a request by the Health System Strategy Division of the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care that MAS provide them with an evidentiary platform on the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of COPD interventions. After an initial review of health technology assessments and systematic reviews of COPD literature and consultation with experts MAS identified the following topics for analysis: vaccinations (influenza and pneumococcal) smoking cessation multidisciplinary care pulmonary rehabilitation long-term oxygen therapy noninvasive positive pressure ventilation for acute and chronic respiratory failure hospital-at-home for acute exacerbations of COPD and telehealth (including telemonitoring and telephone support). Evidence-based analyses were prepared for each of these topics. For each technology an economic analysis was also completed where appropriate. In addition a review of the qualitative literature on patient caregiver and provider perspectives on living and dying with COPD was conducted as were reviews of the qualitative literature on each of the technologies included in these analyses. The Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Mega-Analysis series is made up of the following reports which can be publicly accessed at the MAS website at: http://www.hqontario.ca/en/mas/mas_ohtas_mn.html.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this analysis was to determine the effectiveness of the influenza vaccination and the pneumococcal vaccination in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in reducing the incidence of influenza-related illness or pneumococcal pneumonia. CLINICAL NEED: CONDITION AND TARGET POPULATION: INFLUENZA DISEASE: Influenza is a global threat. It is believed that the risk of a pandemic of influenza still exists. Three pandemics occurred in the 20(th) century which resulted in millions of deaths worldwide. The fourth pandemic of H1N1 influenza occurred in 2009 and affected countries in all continents. Rates of serious illness due to influenza viruses are high among older people and patients with chronic conditions such as COPD. The influenza viruses spread from person to person through sneezing and coughing. Infected persons can transfer the virus even a day before their symptoms start. The incubation period is 1 to 4 days with a mean of 2 days. Symptoms of influenza infection include fever shivering dry cough headache runny or stuffy nose muscle ache and sore throat. Other symptoms such as nausea vomiting and diarrhea can occur. Complications of influenza infection include viral pneumonia secondary bacterial pneumonia and other secondary bacterial infections such as bronchitis sinusitis and otitis media. In viral pneumonia patients develop acute fever and dyspnea and may further show signs and symptoms of hypoxia. The organisms involved in bacterial pneumonia are commonly identified as Staphylococcus aureus and Hemophilus influenza.

932,932,Analysis of Streptococcus pneumoniae secreted antigens by immuno-proteomic approach.,"Streptococcus pneumoniae is an important human pathogen that causes a variety of diseases in both adults and children such as pneumonia bacteremia meningitis otitis media and sinusitis. Despite their clinical importance to date there have been few proteomic studies of these strains for screening of virulence factors or diagnostic markers. In the present study secreted proteins (secretome) of Streptococcus pneumoniae strains were enriched using ammonium sulfate precipitation and identified by the shotgun proteomic method using 1-dimensional electrophoresis liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry analysis. Characterization of the identified proteins revealed that 17.8% (42) of the secreted proteins possessed signal peptides. Twenty-one secreted proteins belonged to the extracellular group and 4 secreted proteins belonged to the cell wall group. Well-known virulence factors (PrtA PspC PsaA PbpA PhtD AmiA ZmpB Eno and Ply) were included in the secreted protein fraction. Western blotting using antiserum against secreted protein mixtures showed that Gsp-781 Sphtra NagA PhtD ZmpB and Eno were strongly immunogenic. Our data suggest that the immuno-proteomic approach is a useful method for high-throughput identification of secreted proteins and screening of candidate vaccine antigens or diagnostic markers.

933,933,Proinflammatory activity of cell-wall constituents from gram-positive bacteria.,"Innate immunity reacts to conserved bacterial molecules. The outermost lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of Gram-negative organisms is highly inflammatory. It activates responsive cells via specific CD14 and toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4) surface receptor and co-receptors. Gram-positive bacteria do not contain LPS but carry surface teichoic acids lipoteichoic acids and peptidoglycan instead. Among these the thick peptidoglycan is the most conserved. It also triggers cytokine release via CD14 but uses the TLR2 co-receptor instead of TLR4 used by LPS. Moreover whole peptidoglycan is 1000-fold less active than LPS in a weight-to-weight ratio. This suggests either that it is not important for inflammation or that only part of it is reactive while the rest acts as ballast. Biochemical dissection of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae cell walls indicates that the second assumption is correct. Long soluble peptidoglycan chains (approximately 125 kDa) are poorly active. Hydrolysing these chains to their minimal unit (2 sugars and a stem peptide) completely abrogates inflammation. Enzymatic dissection of the pneumococcal wall generated a mixture of highly active fragments constituted of trimeric stem peptides and poorly active fragments constituted of simple monomers and dimers or highly polymerized structures. Hence the optimal constraint for activation might be 3 cross-linked stem peptides. The importance of structural constraint was demonstrated in additional studies. For example replacing the first L-alanine in the stem peptide with a D-alanine totally abrogated inflammation in experimental meningitis. Likewise modifying the D-alanine decorations of lipoteichoic acids with L-alanine or deacylating them from their diacylglycerol lipid anchor also decreased the inflammatory response. Thus although considered as a broad-spectrum pattern-recognizing system innate immunity can detect very subtle differences in Gram-positive walls. This high specificity underlines the importance of using well-characterized microbial material in investigating the system.['Journal Article' ""Research Support Non-U.S. Gov't"" 'Review']None",FALSE,"Proinflammatory activity of cell-wall constituents from gram-positive bacteria.Innate immunity reacts to conserved bacterial molecules.

934,934,Diagnostic value of latex agglutination test in diagnosis of acute bacterial meningitis.,OBJECTIVES: To know the incidence of bacterial meningitis in children below five years of age. To compare conventional culture and antigen detection methods (Latex agglutination test). MATERIALS AND METHODS: 100 CSF samples of clinically suspected meningitis cases in children below 5 years of age were included. The samples were subjected to cell count Gram stain culture and LAT. The organisms isolated in the study were characterized according to standard procedures. RESULTS: Of the 100 cases studied 31 cases were diagnosed as ABM by Gram stain culture and latex agglutination test as per WHO criteria. The hospital frequency of ABM was 1.7%. 15 (48.38) cases were culture positive. Gram stain was positive in 22(70.96) cases and LAT in 17(54.83) cases. Haemophilus influenzae was the most common causative agent of acute bacterial meningitis followed by S.pneumoniae. Case fatality rate was 45.16%. The sensitivity and specificity of LAT was 66.66% and 87.91% respectively. CONCLUSION: Bacterial meningitis is a medical emergency and early diagnosis and treatment is life saving and reduces chronic morbidity. LAT was more sensitive compared to conventional Gram stain and Culture technique in identifying the fastidious organisms like H.influenzae S.pneumoniae and Group B Streptococcus. However the combination of Gram stain Culture and LAT proved to be more productive than any of the single tests alone.['Journal Article']None,TRUE,Diagnostic value of latex agglutination test in diagnosis of acute bacterial meningitis.OBJECTIVES: To know the incidence of bacterial meningitis in children below five years of age.

936,936,Pneumococcal urinary antigen positivity in healthy colonized children: is it age dependent?,"BACKGROUND: Pneumococcal urinary antigen test is a valuable tool for diagnosing pneumococcal pneumonia and meningitis in adults. Its use in children is generally not accepted because of nonspecificity at this age. It is frequently positive in asymptomatic nasopharyngeal carriers. The aim of our study was to assess the age limit from which the test is no longer positive in asymptomatic healthy carriers. METHODS: A total of 197 children aged 36-83 months attending 9 day care centers in Prague were enrolled during February and March 2010. Nasopharyngeal swab specimens were collected from each participant and selectively cultivated. The presence of pneumococcal antigen in urine was detected by BinaxNOW® S. pneumoniae kit. RESULTS: Streptococcus pneumoniae was cultivated in 53.3 % of healthy children with the highest colonization rate (59.3 %) in children aged 48-59 months. The most frequently colonizing serotypes were: 19F 23F 3 19A 6B and 4. The presence of pneumococcal antigen in urine decreased with age from 39.0 % in 36-47 months to 17.9 % in 72-83 months old (p = 0.031). The antigen positivity was serotype-dependent and more frequent in nonvaccinated children. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated age-dependent linear decrease of pneumococcal antigen excretion into urine in healthy children. The positivity rate of the test in children aged 72-83 months was similar to that referred in healthy adults irrespective of colonization. To confirm this age limit for use of this test in diagnostics of pneumococcal diseases further study in school-age children is justified.['Journal Article' ""Research Support Non-U.S. Gov't""]None",FALSE,"Pneumococcal urinary antigen positivity in healthy colonized children: is it age dependent?BACKGROUND: Pneumococcal urinary antigen test is a valuable tool for diagnosing pneumococcal pneumonia and meningitis in adults.

To confirm this age limit for use of this test in diagnostics of pneumococcal diseases further study in school-age children is justified.['Journal Article' ""Research Support Non-U.S. Gov't""]None",FALSE,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 936}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 936}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 936}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 936}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 936}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 936}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 936}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 936}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 936}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 936}",1
937,937,Leukocyte attraction by CCL20 and its receptor CCR6 in humans and mice with pneumococcal meningitis.,"We previously identified CCL20 as an early chemokine in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with pneumococcal meningitis but its functional relevance was unknown. Here we studied the role of CCL20 and its receptor CCR6 in pneumococcal meningitis. In a prospective nationwide study CCL20 levels were significantly elevated in the CSF of patients with pneumococcal meningitis and correlated with CSF leukocyte counts. CCR6-deficient mice with pneumococcal meningitis and WT mice with pneumococcal meningitis treated with anti-CCL20 antibodies both had reduced CSF white blood cell counts. The reduction in CSF pleocytosis was also accompanied by an increase in brain bacterial titers. Additional in vitro experiments showed direct chemoattractant activity of CCL20 for granulocytes.

938,938,"Decline in the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease at a medical center in Taiwan, 2000-2012.",BACKGROUND: It is essential to investigate the serotype distribution of pneumococcal diseases in each region and its associated clinical features. This study investigated the annual incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) and the distribution of serotypes of isolates causing IPD at a medical center in northern Taiwan during the period 2000 to 2012. METHODS: Serotypes of all available Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates causing IPD were determined using the latex agglutination test. RESULTS: During the study period the annual incidence (per 10 000 admissions) of IPD decreased significantly from 9.8 in 2000 to 2.1 in 2012 (P < 0.001). The annual incidence of all-cause bacteremia primary pneumococcal bacteremia bacteremic pneumonia peritonitis and meningitis also decreased significantly during the study period (P < 0.05). In contrast to the decrease in annual incidence of pneumococcal serotypes 14 23F and 6B the incidence and the proportion of serotype 19A significantly increased with time (P < 0.001). The coverage rate of 7-valent protein conjugated vaccine (PCV-7) and PCV-10 decreased significantly; however the coverage rate of PCV-13 and pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV-23) remained stable over time. Serotype 14 and 19A isolates were commonly isolated from blood and pleural effusion respectively. Serotypes 14 and 23F were the two most common serotypes found in adult patients and serotypes 14 and 19A were the two most common serotypes isolated from children. CONCLUSIONS: Although the incidence of IPD has decreased serotype 19A is an emerging problem in Taiwan. The distribution of serotypes of pneumococci varied with clinical symptoms and age.

939,939,"Immunogenicity and safety of an investigational multicomponent, recombinant, meningococcal serogroup B vaccine (4CMenB) administered concomitantly with routine infant and child vaccinations: results of two randomised trials.","BACKGROUND: Meningococcal serogroup B disease disproportionately affects infants. We assessed lot-to-lot consistency safety and immunogenicity and the effect of concomitant vaccination on responses to routine vaccines of an investigational multicomponent vaccine (4CMenB) in this population. METHODS: We did primary and booster phase 3 studies between March 31 2008 and Aug 16 2010 in 70 sites in Europe. We used two series of sponsor-supplied computer-generated randomisation envelopes to allocate healthy 2 month-old infants to receive routine vaccinations (diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis inactivated poliovirus hepatitis B plus Haemophilus influenzae type b and seven-valent pneumococcal vaccine) at 2 4 and 6 months of age alone or concomitantly with 4CMenB or serogroup C conjugate vaccine (MenC) in: 1) an open-label lot-to-lot immunogenicity and safety substudy of three 4CMenB lots compared with routine vaccines alone (1:1:1:1 block size eight); or 2) an observer-blind lot-to-lot safety substudy of three 4CMenB lots compared with MenC (1:1:1:3 block size six). At 12 months 4CMenB-primed children from either substudy were randomised (1:1 block size two) to receive 4CMenB booster with or without measles-mumps-rubella-varicella (MMRV) vaccine. Immunogenicity was assessed by serum bactericidal assay with human complement (hSBA) against serogroup B test strains and on randomly selected subsets of serum samples for routine vaccines; laboratory personnel were masked to assignment. The first coprimary outcome was lot-to-lot consistency (hSBA geometric mean ratio of all lots between 0·5 and 2·0) and the second was an immune response (hSBA titre ≥5) for each of the three strains. The primary outcome for the booster study was immune response to booster dose. Immunogenicity data for 4CMenB were for the modified intention-to-treat population including all infants from the open-label substudy who provided serum samples. The safety population included all participants who contributed safety data after at least one dose of study vaccine. These trials are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov numbers NCT00657709 and NCT00847145. FINDINGS: We enrolled 2627 infants in the open-label phase 1003 in the observer-blind phase and 1555 in the booster study. Lot-to-lot consistency was shown for the three 4CMenB lots with the lowest 95% lower confidence limit being 0·74 and the highest upper limit being 1·33. Of 1181–1184 infants tested 1 month after three 4CMenB doses (all lots pooled) 100% (95% CI 99–100) had hSBA titres of 5 or more against strains selective for factor H binding protein and neisserial adhesin A and 84% (82–86) for New Zealand outer-membrane vesicle. In a subset (n=100) 84% (75–91) of infants had hSBA titres of 5 or more against neisseria heparin binding antigen. At 12 months of age waning titres were boosted by a fourth dose such that 95–100% of children had hSBA titres of 5 or more for all antigens with or without concomitant MMRV. Immune responses to routine vaccines were much the same with or without concomitant 4CMenB but concomitant vaccination was associated with increased reactogenicity. 77% (1912 of 2478) of infants had fever of 38·5°C or higher after any 4CMenB dose compared with 45% (295 of 659) after routine vaccines alone and 47% (228 of 490) with MenC but only two febrile seizures were deemed probably related to 4CMenB. INTERPRETATION: 4CMenB is immunogenic in infants and children aged 12 months with no clinically relevant interference with routine vaccines but increases reactogenicity when administered concomitantly with routine vaccines.

940,940,Invasive pneumococcal disease in infants younger than 90 days before and after introduction of PCV7.,"BACKGROUND: Introduction of the heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) changed the epidemiology of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD). We evaluated the changes that occurred after PCV7 introduction among Utah infants aged 1 to 90 days too young to be fully immunized. METHODS: We identified children <18 years with culture-confirmed IPD from 1997-2010. We analyzed demographic clinical and serotype data for infants aged 1-90 days. The pre- and post-vaccine introduction periods spanned 1997-2000 and 2001-2010 respectively. RESULTS: Of 513 children with IPD 36 were 1 to 90 days and accounted for 7% of IPD cases in both the pre- and post-vaccine introduction period. The pre-vaccine IPD incidence rate was 5.0 per 100 000 live births and was unchanged in the post-vaccine introduction period. IPD caused by PCV7 serotypes decreased by 74% (from 2.2 to 0.58 per 100 000) whereas non-vaccine serotype IPD increased by 57% (from 2.8 to 4.4 per 100 000). Sixteen infants (44%) required intensive care and 3 (8%) died. Bacteremia without focus (56%) and meningitis (44%) were the predominant syndromes in the pre- and post-vaccine introduction periods respectively. In the post-vaccine introduction period serotype 7F was the most common serotype among infants and was responsible for 50% of meningitis. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of IPD in Utah infants aged 1 to 90 days caused by PCV7 serotypes decreased after PCV7 introduction but overall incidence was unchanged.

METHODS: We enrolled 2 groups of children 3 months to 5 years of age presenting to an urban pediatric emergency department or hospital-based clinic between January 1 2000 and January 1 2001. The study group included patients with S pneumoniae bacteremia. The control group included patients without fever or identified focal bacterial infection (other than a urinary tract infection). We excluded from the control group patients with a recent diagnosis (prior 4 weeks) of bacteremia pneumonia meningitis acute otitis media or other suspected S pneumoniae infection. RESULTS: Ninety-six patients were enrolled: 24 children with S pneumoniae bacteremia and 72 afebrile control patients. The assay produced a positive result in 23 of 24 patients with pneumococcal bacteremia yielding a sensitivity of 95.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] 78.9% to 99.9%).

Neissieria meningitidis was the most common cause of meningitis accounting for 39.2% of cases of meningitis in 1983-91 and 47% of cases in 1992-99 followed by H. influenzae (31%) Streptococcus pneumoniae (22.4%) GBS (3.9%) and L. monocytogenes (3.5%) in 1983-91 and S. pneumoniae (36.3%) H. influenzae (7.8%) GBS (6.1%) and L. monocytogenes (2.8%) in 1992-99. The important epidemiological features of meningitis and INMD caused by these 5 pathogens between 1983-91 and 1992-99 include: 1. The incidence of bacterial meningitis due to S. pneumoniae and GBS was stable; 2. S. pneumoniae was the predominant cause of INMD in both periods; 3.

Adhesion of bacterial cells on the brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) mediated through protein-protein interactions is one of the crucial steps in translocation of bacteria across BBB. In this work we proposed a systematic workflow for identification of cell wall associated ligands of pneumococcus that might adhere to the human BMECs. The proteome of S. pneumoniae was biotinylated and incubated with BMECs. Interacting proteins were recovered by affinity purification and identified by data independent acquisition (DIA). A total of 44 proteins were identified from which 22 were found to be surface-exposed. Based on the subcellular location ontology protein interactive analysis and literature review five ligands (adhesion lipoprotein endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase PhtA and two hypothetical proteins Spr0777 and Spr1730) were selected to validate experimentally (ELISA and immunocytochemistry) the ligand-BMECs interaction. In this study we proposed a high-throughput approach to generate a dataset of plausible bacterial ligands followed by systematic bioinformatics pipeline to categorize the protein candidates for experimental validation.

968,968,Evaluation of a latex particle agglutination kit in pneumococcal disease.,Latex particle agglutination for Streptococcus pneumoniae was evaluated in 76 patients. Fifteen of these patients had invasive disease due to S. pneumoniae including 12 with meningitis 2 with occult bacteremia and 1 with suppurative arthritis. Five of the patients with meningitis also had bacteremia. Pneumococcal antigen was detected in the cerebrospinal fluid of 9 of the 12 patients with meningitis (sensitivity 75%).

969,969,Antibody responses to capsular polysaccharide backbone and O-acetate side groups of Streptococcus pneumoniae type 9V in humans and rhesus macaques.,Streptococcus pneumoniae is responsible for high rates of pneumococcal bacteremia meningitis pneumonia and acute otitis media worldwide. Protection from disease is conferred by antibodies specific for the polysaccharide (Ps) capsule of the bacteria. Of the four types of group 9 pneumococci types 9N and 9V cause the most disease and both types are included in the polyvalent pneumococcal vaccine. The type 9V capsule consists of repeating pentasaccharide units linearly arranged with an average of 1 to 2 mol of O-acetate side chains per mol of repeat units added in a complex pattern in which not all repeat units are alike. alpha-GlcA residues may be O-acetylated in the 2 (17%) or 3 (25%) position and beta-ManNAc residues may be O-acetylated in the 4 (6%) or 6 (55%) position. Under certain conditions the O-acetate side chains are subject to oxidation which results in subsequent de-O-acetylation of a significant number of the repeat units. This de-O-acetylation could adversely affect the efficacy of a vaccine containing the 9V Ps. A study was undertaken to compare the relative contributions of O-acetate and Ps backbone epitopes in the immune response to S. pneumoniae 9V type-specific Ps. In both an infant rhesus monkey model and humans antibodies against the non-O-acetylated 9V backbone as well as against O-acetylated 9V Ps were detected. Functional (opsonophagocytic) activity was observed in antisera in which the predominant species of antibody recognized de-O-acetylated 9V Ps. We concluded that the O-acetate side groups while recognized are not essential to the ability of the 9V Ps to induce functional antibody responses.['Journal Article']None,FALSE,Antibody responses to capsular polysaccharide backbone and O-acetate side groups of Streptococcus pneumoniae type 9V in humans and rhesus macaques.Streptococcus pneumoniae is responsible for high rates of pneumococcal bacteremia meningitis pneumonia and acute otitis media worldwide.

978,978,Chapter 28: a history of bacterial meningitis.,"Thomas Willis (1621-1675) described patients with ""inflammation of the meninges with a continual fever"" as well as an early (1661) epidemic of meningitis. Robert Whytt (1714-1766) provided a classic depiction of tuberculous meningitis and its stages later extended by John Cheyne (1777-1836). Gaspard Vieusseux (1746-1814) and Andre Matthey (1778-1842) in Geneva and Elisa North (1771-1843) in Massachusetts described epidemic (meningococcal) meningitis. Heinrich Quincke (1842-1922) utilized his new technique of lumbar puncture (1891) to provide an early analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). William Mestrezat (1883-1929) and H. Houston Merritt (1902-1979) later compiled large series of CSF profiles in meningitis. Organisms causing meningitis were identified in the late 19th century including Streptococcus pneumoniae Neisseria meningitidis and Haemophilus influenzae.

980,980,miR-141-3p inhibits the activation of astrocytes and the release of inflammatory cytokines in bacterial meningitis through down-regulating HMGB1.,"BACKGROUND: Bacterial meningitis (BM) is a serious infectious disease of the central nervous system that often occurs in children and adolescents. Many studies have suggested that microRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in BM. This study aimed to address the effects of miR-141-3p on astrocyte activation and inflammatory response in BM through HMGB1. METHODS: The 3-week-old rats were injected with Streptococcus pneumoniae (SP) into the lateral ventricle to establish a BM model. Loeffler scoring method was used to evaluate the recovery of neurological function. Brain pathological damage was observed by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. Primary astrocytes were isolated from brain tissues of BM or non-infected SD rats. The levels of TNF-α IL-1β and IL-6 in brain tissues and astrocyte culture supernatant were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The targeting relationship between miR-141-3p and HMGB1 was tested using dual-luciferase reporter assay. The expression of miR-141-3p HMGB1 and the astrocytic marker glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) were detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) or western blotting. Methylation-specific PCR (MSP) analysis was performed to measure the methylation status of miR-141 promoter. RESULTS: The results showed that lower Loeffler scores were exhibited in rats with BM. The subarachnoid space of brain tissues of BM rats was widened and obvious inflammatory cells were observed. miR-141-3p expression was reduced in BM rats and SP-treated astrocytes. Additionally we found that overexpression of miR-141-3p led to the downregulation of HMGB1 GFAP and inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α IL-1β and IL-6) in astrocytes. Furthermore the results of dual-luciferase reporter assay confirmed that miR-141-3p directly targeted HMGB1. Overexpression of miR-141-3p inhibited the levels of GFAP TNF-α IL-1β and IL-6 in astrocytes which was eliminated by the up-regulation of HMGB1. The results of MSP analysis indicated that miR-141 promoter was highly methylated in brain tissues and astrocytes. DNMT1 was involved in the methylation of miR-141 promoter in BM. CONCLUSION: The present study verified that miR-141-3p affected inflammatory response by suppressing HMGB1 in SP-induced astrocytes and BM rat model.['Journal Article' ""Research Support Non-U.S. Gov't""]None",FALSE,"miR-141-3p inhibits the activation of astrocytes and the release of inflammatory cytokines in bacterial meningitis through down-regulating HMGB1.BACKGROUND: Bacterial meningitis (BM) is a serious infectious disease of the central nervous system that often occurs in children and adolescents.

In this study we applied this PCR analysis to 296 CSF samples from patients who were suspected of having meningitis. Of the 296 samples that were examined 59 samples were positive according to the CSF culture and/or molecular assays. Forty-six CSF samples were positive for both the CSF culture and our real-time PCR assay while 13 samples were positive for the real-time PCR but negative for the traditional assays.

A review.,The pneumococcus is currently the most common cause of vaccine-preventable death in children aged less than 5 years and in 2002 was responsible for 716 000 deaths worldwide. Treatment with antibiotics was the main approach to contain the pneumococcus however even with effective antibiotics pneumococcal meningitis has a poor prognosis and with the emergence of drug resistant pneumococcal disease the need for prevention by vaccine was evident. The first born pneumococcal vaccines were polysaccharide vaccines that unfortunately did not protect young children. The most vulnerable age group of children less than 2 years of age were without any form of protection from the pneumococcus until the licensure of a conjugate vaccine. Conjugation of bacteria polysaccharides to carrier proteins has been a significant milestone in the work of vaccine development and has been previously used successfully in the production of the Haemophilus influenzae-print type b vaccine. The seven-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine was first licensed in the USA in 2000 and in the European Union this conjugate vaccine was licensed in February 2001. Currently fourteen countries have included this vaccine in their immunization programmes. Vaccination policies are found to differ greatly across Europe due to differences in local epidemiological situation and also due to economic considerations. However many countries are reviewing their own policies based on available data on the burden of pneumococcal disease.

Meningitis is a serious communicable disease with high morbidity and mortality rates. It is an endemic disease in Egypt caused mainly by Streptococcus pneumoniae Neisseria meningitidis and Haemophilus influenzae. In some settings bacterial meningitis is documented depending mainly on positive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) culture results or CSF positive latex agglutination test missing the important role of prior antimicrobial intake which can yield negative culture and latex agglutination test results. This study aimed to utilize molecular technology in order to diagnose bacterial meningitis in culture-negative CSF samples. Materials and Methods. Forty culture-negative CSF samples from suspected cases of bacterial meningitis were examined by real-time polymerase chain reaction (real-time PCR) for the presence of lytA bexA and ctrA genes specific for Streptococcus pneumoniae Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria meningitidis respectively. Results. Positive real-time PCR results for Streptococcus pneumoniae were detected in 36 (90%) of culture-negative CSF samples while no positive results for Haemophilus influenzae or Neisseria meningitidis were detected. Four (10%) samples were negative by real-time PCR for all tested organisms. Conclusion.

Failure to confirm suspected cases of meningitis results in overestimating reported cases and incorrectly treating false positives. The latex particle agglutination test is a diagnostic alternative that overcomes these limitations. OBJECTIVE: Determine the bacteriological and therapeutic profile as well as the course of cases of acute meningitis confirmed by the latex agglutination test at Sourô-Sanou University Hospital. METHODS: This prospective longitudinal study took place over a one-year period (2008 to 2009). Data were collected from clinical and laboratory records. The diagnosis of meningitis was confirmed by testing for specific soluble antigens in the spinal fluid. We used the Pastorex(™) Meningitis Kit for that purpose. The threshold of significance selected for our study was 0.05. RESULTS: In all 457 samples of spinal fluid from patients with suspected acute bacterial meningitis were analyzed and the latex test was performed in 438 of these samples: 154 (35.2%) were positive. The average age of our cases confirmed by the latex test was 13.2 ± 4.2 years old. This test confirmed more cases than any other method of identification. The therapeutic strategy used from one to four treatment agents. Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most virulent and the most lethal pathogen with a 64.7% lethality rate. CONCLUSION: The earliness of the consultation and the treatment of the bacterial meningitis seem to have a positive effect on the course of disease.['English Abstract' 'Journal Article']None,TRUE,[Acute bacterial meningitis with soluble antigen detected by latex particle agglutination tests at the Sourô-Sanou University Hospital of Bobo-Dioulasso (Burkina Faso)].INTRODUCTION: Acute bacterial meningitis constitutes a major public health problem in Burkina Faso in part because of its high lethality rate estimated in 2004 at 17.5%.

However the antimicrobial peptide cathelicidin seems important to host defense. We studied how cathelicidin concentrations and bacterial load in CSF relate in childhood BM and to what extent they may predict the disease outcome. METHODS: The patient data originated from a large prospective clinical trial in Latin America in 1996-2003 in which the CSF samples were collected on admission (CSF1) and 12-24 hours later (CSF2). The cathelicidin concentrations were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and the CSF bacterial load by real-time polymerase chain reaction. This analysis comprised 76 children with meningitis caused by Haemophilus influenzae type b (n = 44) Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 28) or Neisseria meningitidis (n = 4). RESULTS: The cathelicidin concentration correlated with the bacterial genome count in both samples (CSF1: ρ = 0.531 P < 0.001; CSF2: ρ = 0.553 P < 0.001). A high CSF1 ratio of cathelicidin to the bacterial genome count was associated with fewer audiologic sequelae (odds ratio: 0.11 95% confidence interval: 0.02-0.61 P = 0.01) and more favorable neurologic outcomes (odds ratio: 3.95 95% confidence interval: 1.22-12.8 P = 0.02) but not with better survival.

The aims of this study were i) to compare the conventional methods and molecular methods which detected pneumococcal surface antigen A (psaA) and autolysin (lytA) genes; ii) to determine the serotype distribution of S. pneumoniae isolated from the respiratory samples. Randomly chosen 62 S. pneumoniae strains isolated from respiratory samples of patients with clinically proven pneumococcal pneumonia (age range: 1-79 years) between years 2000-2006 were included in the study. Classical microbiological analysis for the isolates included Gram staining optochin sensitivity test performed in 5% CO2 and ambient air and bile solubility test. Capsular serotyping was performed by using latex particles sensitized with mono-specific typing sera (Statens Serum Institut Denmark). Quellung reaction (Statens Serum Institut Denmark) was used for serotyping the isolates that gave equivocal results using latex agglutination. Pneumococcal surface antigen A and autolysin genes were detected by in-house polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using psaA1 (5'-CTT TCT GCA ATC ATT CTT G) psaA2 (5'-GCC TTC TTT ACC TTG TTC TGC) lytAF (5'-ACG CAA TCT AGC AGA TGA AGC) and lytAR (5'-TGT TTG GTT GGT TAT TCG TGC) primers. Twenty six different serotypes were detected in 62 S. pneumoniae isolates. The most prevalent capsule serotype was 14 (n= 6) followed by 19A (n= 5). Four isolates could not be typed by the available antisera. All the isolates were optochin sensitive with or without carbondioxide incubation and were bile soluble. All the isolates included in the study have harboured (100%) psaA and lytA genes. No difference was found between the classical and molecular methods for the identification of S. pneumoniae isolates.

Pneumococcal surface antigen A and autolysin genes were detected by in-house polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using psaA1 (5'-CTT TCT GCA ATC ATT CTT G) psaA2 (5'-GCC TTC TTT ACC TTG TTC TGC) lytAF (5'-ACG CAA TCT AGC AGA TGA AGC) and lytAR (5'-TGT TTG GTT GGT TAT TCG TGC) primers. Twenty six different serotypes were detected in 62 S. pneumoniae isolates. The most prevalent capsule serotype was 14 (n= 6) followed by 19A (n= 5). Four isolates could not be typed by the available antisera. All the isolates were optochin sensitive with or without carbondioxide incubation and were bile soluble. All the isolates included in the study have harboured (100%) psaA and lytA genes. No difference was found between the classical and molecular methods for the identification of S. pneumoniae isolates. In conclusion detection of psaA and/or lytA genes by molecular methods is of value especially in ""nonserotypeable strains"" when they are performed with conventional methods in clinically proven S. pneumoniae isolates.['Comparative Study' 'English Abstract' 'Journal Article']None",FALSE,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 995}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 995}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 995}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 995}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 995}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 995}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 995}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 995}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 995}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 995}",1

997,997,Safety and immunogenicity of four doses of Neisseria meningitidis group C vaccine conjugated to CRM197 in United States infants.,BACKGROUND: Following widespread use of conjugate pneumococcal vaccine Neisseria meningitidis likely will become the leading cause of bacterial sepsis and meningitis in US children. This report describes the safety and immunogenicity in US children of four consecutive doses of a meningococcal group C vaccine conjugated to CRM197 via reductive amination (MnCC). METHODS: One hundred six healthy 2-month-old infants received MnCC at 2 4 and 6 months of age in a randomized controlled double blind study; children in the other treatment arm were given a 7-valent conjugate pneumococcal vaccine. Parents reenrolled 64 of these children at 12 to 15 months to receive a fourth dose of MnCC. Routine childhood vaccines including DTP were coadministered. Temperatures and symptoms were recorded for 3 days after each immunization. Serum enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay IgG and bactericidal antibodies were measured prevaccination and before and 1 month after Doses 3 and 4. RESULTS: Moderate to severe local reactions defined as erythema or induration > or =2.4 cm or pain that interfered with limb movement was reported after 0 to 3.2% of MnCC injections depending on the reaction and dose. Fever occurred in 23 to 37% of children but the contribution of MnCC to the febrile reactions is unknown. Geometric mean concentrations of IgG antibody to group C meningococcal polysaccharide were 3.72 microg/ml after Dose 3 and 8.03 microg/ml after the booster. Geometric mean functional serum bactericidal antibody titers after Doses 3 and 4 were 1:463 and 1:2341 respectively. One hundred percent of children had a serum bactericidal antibody titer of > or =1:64 after three doses and > or = 1:128 after the booster. CONCLUSIONS: The MnCC vaccine had an acceptable safety profile and generated high titers of bactericidal antibody in immunized US infants and toddlers.

1000,1000,Epidemiologic pattern of meningococcal meningitis in northern Cameroon in 2007-2010: contribution of PCR-enhanced surveillance.,"OBJECTIVES: Monitoring acute bacterial meningitis in northern Cameroon. METHODS: Health professionals collected cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimens from patients presenting with clinical symptoms of meningitis. Specimens were tested using gram stain latex agglutination test and culture. A PCR assay completed the diagnostic testing. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) was performed on some Neisseria meningitidis (Nm) isolates. RESULTS: From 2007 through 2010 of the 1429 CSF specimens tested 292 (20·4%) were positive either for Nm (205) Streptococcus pneumoniae (Sp) (57) or Haemophilus influenzae (Hi) (30). From 2007 through 2009 the serogroup W135 represented 98·8% of 164 case isolates. Until 2008 most serogroup W135 isolates presented the sequence-type ST-2881 usually associated with sporadic cases. Since 2009 the ST-11 (an epidemic-associated clone) became predominant although no epidemic occurred. Serogroup A ST-7 was observed in 2010 and caused a localized epidemic. Using the detection PCR on turbid CSF a 2·7-fold increase in cases with etiologic diagnosis was obtained compared to culture. All tested meningococcal isolates (42) were susceptible to ampicillin chloramphenicol and cefotaxim. CONCLUSIONS: Resurgence of serogroup A and recent increase in ST-11 among serogroup W135 isolates were worrying when considered with the epidemic wave of serogroup A meningitis which affected neighboring countries and the serogroup W135 epidemic in Niger in 2009-2010.['Journal Article' ""Research Support Non-U.S. Gov't""]None",FALSE,"Epidemiologic pattern of meningococcal meningitis in northern Cameroon in 2007-2010: contribution of PCR-enhanced surveillance.OBJECTIVES: Monitoring acute bacterial meningitis in northern Cameroon.

Despite the availability of potent newer antibiotics the mortality rate caused by acute bacterial meningitis remains significantly high in India and in other developing countries which ranges from 16 - 32%. There is a need of a periodic review of bacterial meningitis worldwide since the pathogens which are responsible for the infection may vary with time geography and the age of the patient. AIMS: Our aim was to study the bacterial profiles and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of the CSF isolates which were obtained from patients of acute bacterial meningitis in our area. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: Two hundred and fifty two clinically diagnosed cases of acute bacterial meningitis who were admitted to the wards of a tertiary medical centre in Patna during the period from August 2011 to December 2012 were included in this study. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Two hundred and fifty two CSF samples from as many patients of ABM were processed for cell counts biochemical analysis gram staining culture antigen detection by latex agglutination test (LAT) and antibiotic susceptibility tests as per the standard techniques. RESULTS: In this study 62.3% patients were males and 37.7% were females The most common age group of presentation was 12-60 years (80.2%). Gram stained smears were positive in 162 (64.3%) samples while culture yielded positive growth in 200 (79.4%) patients. Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most common pathogen which was isolated in 120 (60%) culture positive cases. Cell counts showed the predominance of neutrophils in all cases with ABM. High protein and low sugar levels correlated well with the features of ABM. All gram positive isolates were sensitive to vancomycin. All the gram negative isolates were sensitive to imipenem. Twenty two (8.7%) patients expired during the course of study. Deaths were caused by N.meningitidis in 9 (40.9%) cases by S.pneumoniae in 3 (13.6%) cases and by H.influenzea in 1 (4.5%) case. In the remaining 9 (40.9%) mortality cases the organism could not be identified. CONCLUSION: Simple rapid inexpensive tests like gram staining remain significant means for diagnosis of ABM in developing countries. LAT for pneumococcal antigen should be performed first since Streptococcus pneumoniae remains the major aetiological agent of ABM both in adults and children. The final diagnosis of ABM depends upon a comprehensive analysis of CSF smears cultures LAT cytological biochemical and clinical findings of the cases and a single test or parameter cannot be used to decide the course of management in the patients.

1002,1002,The human polymeric immunoglobulin receptor binds to Streptococcus pneumoniae via domains 3 and 4.,"Streptococcus pneumoniae (the pneumococcus) is a major cause of bacterial pneumonia middle ear infection (otitis media) sepsis and meningitis. Our previous study demonstrated that the choline-binding protein A (CbpA) of S. pneumoniae binds to the human polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR) and enhances pneumococcal adhesion to and invasion of cultured epithelial cells. In this study we sought to determine the CbpA-binding motif on pIgR by deletional analysis. The extra-cellular portion of pIgR consists of five Ig-like domains (D1-D5) each of which contains 104-114 amino acids and two disulfide bonds. Deletional analysis of human pIgR revealed that the lack of either D3 or D4 resulted in the loss of CbpA binding whereas complete deletions of domains D1 D2 and D5 had undetectable impacts. Subsequent analysis showed that domains D3 and D4 together were necessary and sufficient for the ligand-binding activity. Furthermore CbpA binding of pIgR did not appear to require Ca2+ or Mg2+. Finally treating pIgR with a reducing agent abolished CbpA binding suggesting that disulfide bonding is required for the formation of CbpA-binding motif(s).

In the intention of its incorporation in the yet available 14-valent pneumococcal vaccine we have compared serological response and tolerance among four groups of adults: 1) the first group (23 persons) was only immunized by serotype 5 pneumococcal polysaccharide (50 micrograms); 2) the second group (23 persons) by the 15-valent pneumococcal vaccine (14-valent + serotype 5); 3) the third and the fourth groups (21 and 97 persons) were immunized by the 14-valent pneumococcal vaccine. By comparing the multiplying factors of geometrical means of antibodies levels measured by RIA it appears that the pneumococcal polysaccharide serotype 5 is immunogenic dispensed alone (first group) or associated with 14-valent pneumococcal vaccine (second group). No reciprocal interference can be detected between this polysaccharide and the other 14 polysaccharides. The tolerance of the serotype 5 polysaccharide is as good as that of these 14 antigens.['Comparative Study' 'English Abstract' 'Journal Article']None,FALSE,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 1005}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 1005}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 1005}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 1005}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 1005}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 1005}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 1005}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 1005}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 1005}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 1005}",1

Currently approved vaccines target the polysaccharide capsule of which there are over 90 distinct serotypes leading to rapid serotype replacement in vaccinated populations. Substantial progress has been made in the development of a universal pneumococcal vaccine with efforts focused on broadly conserved and protective protein antigens. An area attracting considerable attention is the potential application of live attenuated vaccines to confer serotype-independent protection against mucosal and systemic infection.

Here we have studied a novel immune evasion mechanism of serotype 3 pneumococci which are particularly resistant to phagocytosis. On their surfaces the bacteria express the factor H-binding inhibitor of complement (Hic) a protein of the pneumococcal surface protein C family. Using radioligand binding microtiter plate assays surface plasmon resonance analysis and recombinant constructs of factor H we located the binding site of Hic to short consensus repeats (SCRs) 8-11 in the middle part of factor H. This represents a novel microbial interaction region on factor H. The only other ligand known so far for SCRs 8-11 of factor H is C-reactive protein (CRP) an acute phase protein that binds to the pneumococcal C-polysaccharide. The binding sites of Hic and CRP within the SCR8-11 region were different however because CRP did not inhibit the binding of Hic and required calcium for binding. Binding of factor H to Hic-expressing pneumococci promoted factor I-mediated cleavage of C3b and restricted phagocytosis of pneumococci. Thus virulent pneumococci avoid complement attack and opsonophagocytosis by recruiting functionally active factor H with the Hic surface protein.

A comparison of IPD incidence levels reported for children <5 years of age within the United States (CDC) surveillance system over the past 5 years revealed little variation over that time period. Within the Danish national surveillance system a 3-4 fold increase in bacteremic IPD in that age group was reported over the past 15 years. Nonetheless the United States IPD incidence remains 4-8 fold higher than that reported for Denmark or other Western European countries. A retrospective analysis at one North American hospital spanning 40 years indicated that the seven serogroups represented in the licensed pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (4 6 9 14 18 19 23) consistently comprised 80%-90% of all serogroups causing IPD in young children. More recent retrospective comparisons in Spain the United Kingdom France Belgium and Denmark suggest modest increases in vaccine serogroup coverage over the past 10-20 years. However in European children vaccine serogroups consistently account for 10%-20% less of the overall IPD burden as compared to North American children.

The results indicate an additional synthesis of sICAM-1 in subarachnoidal space during central nervous system (CNS) inflammatory process. An important role of sICAM-1 in the transmigration of different cell types into CSF during CNS inflammation in children with S. pneumoniae and Coxsackie A9 meningoencephalitis may be suggested.['Journal Article']None,FALSE,"{'judgement': 'False', 'index': 1016}",0,"{'judgement': 'False', 'index': 1016}",0,"{'judgement': 'False', 'index': 1016}",0,"{'judgement': 'False', 'index': 1016}",0,"{'judgement': 'False', 'index': 1016}",0,"{'judgement': 'False', 'index': 1016}",0,"{'judgement': 'False', 'index': 1016}",0,"{'judgement': 'False', 'index': 1016}",0,"{'judgement': 'False', 'index': 1016}",0,"{'judgement': 'False', 'index': 1016}",0

In this study we investigated the time period after the start of antibiotic therapy during which culture, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and the immunochromatographic test (ICT) are able to detect bacteria in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Methods: The study was performed on CSF samples from adults with ABM admitted to the Department of Infectious Diseases, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden, from January 2007 to April 2014. In addition to the initial lumbar puncture (LP), the participants underwent one or two more LPs during 10 days following the start of antibiotics. The analyses performed on the CSF samples were culture, PCR and ICT. Results: The study comprised 70 CSF samples from 25 patients with ABM. A bacterium could be identified by CSF culture in 44%, by blood culture in 58% and by PCR in 100% of the patients. There were no positive CSF cultures in samples taken later than the day of starting antibiotics. PCR was positive in 89% on days 1 3, 70% on days 4 6 and 33% on days 7 10. For cases of pneumococcal meningitis, the ICT was positive in 88% on days 1 3, 90% on days 4 6 and 75% on days 7 10.

1020,1020,Rapid diagnosis of pneumococcal meningitis: implications for treatment and measuring disease burden,"Background: Streptococcus pneumoniae is the leading cause of childhood pneumonia and meningitis worldwide. Isolation of this organism, however, is uncommon in resource-poor countries, in part because of extensive use of prior antibiotics. A rapid, highly sensitive immunochromatographic test (ICT) for S. pneumoniae was evaluated for the diagnosis of meningitis. Methods: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from 450 children with suspected meningitis was tested with ICT, and results were compared with CSF culture, latex agglutination test (LAT) and/or polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Serial CSF specimens from 11 patients were also evaluated for duration of positive results during effective antimicrobial therapy. Findings: All 122 cases of pyogenic pneumococcal meningitis positive either by culture (N = 87) or PCR (N = 35) were positive by ICT, yielding 100% (122 of 122) sensitivity. All purulent CSF specimens from patients with meningitis caused by other bacteria by culture (N = 149) or by LAT (N = 48) or those negative by culture, LAT and LytA and thus of unknown etiology (N = 20), and normal CSF specimens (N = 104) were negative by ICT. Thus the specificity of ICT also was 100% (321 of 321), although negativity of ICT was not confirmed by PCR, if it was positive for other organisms either by culture or LAT. Serotyping of S. pneumoniae strains revealed 28 different serotypes, indicating that outcome of ICT are independent of diverse capsular serotype of pneumococcus. Antigen was detected by ICT for at least 10 days after presentation, and 1 was still positive on day 20, which was longer than for either LAT or PCR. Interpretation: ICT for pneumococcal antigen in CSF is 100% sensitive and specific in diagnosing pyogenic pneumococcal meningitis and can detect ∼30% more pneumococcal meningitis cases than with culture alone. The simplicity of the test procedure and the longevity of CSF antigen detection suggest the potential utility of ICT to estimate the true burden of pneumococcal disease, as for Haemophilus influenzae type b using data from meningitis, and to guide selection of appropriate antibiotic treatment, especially in resource-poor countries with widespread prehospital antimicrobial use.

1021,1021,Use of the NOW Streptococcus pneumoniae urinary antigen test in cerebrospinal fluid for rapid diagnosis of pneumococcal meningitis,"Streptococcus pneumoniae is one of the most common pathogens in bacterial meningitis. Rapid diagnosis is critical for effective treatment. The aim of this study was to assess the accuracy of the NOW S. pneumoniae Urinary Antigen Test, (Binax, Portland, ME, USA) originally developed for urine testing, in detecting the S. pneumoniae antigen in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The study included 519 patients with suspected meningitis. CSF, blood and urine samples were cultured according to standard methods. CSF viral culture was also performed. CSF and urine specimens were tested for pneumococcal antigen with the NOW S. pneumoniae test. S. pneumoniae was isolated from the CSF of 22 patients. The direct antigen test was positive in CSF in 21/22 patients (95.4% sensitivity), and in urine, in 12/21 (57.1% sensitivity). Direct CSF smear was positive in 15/22 (68% sensitivity). CSF samples that cultured negative for S. pneumoniae (n = 470) or positive for other bacteria (n = 27) were also negative on the NOW test (100% specificity). By contrast, urine samples of 63/470 of patients with negative CSF culture were positive on the NOW test, as were 5/27 urine samples of patients with CSF culture positive for other bacteria (p = 0.45). The NOW S. pneumoniae antigen test in CSF yields a rapid and very reliable diagnosis of pneumococcal meningitis, enabling prompt and adequate treatment. Its low sensitivity in urine indicates that this mode of testing is not useful for the diagnosis of pneumococcal meningitis.
