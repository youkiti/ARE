260,Accumulation of Ga-67 citrate in a tuberculous splenic abscess. Report of a rare case,A case of 65-year-old man with tuberculous splenic abscess is presented. The Ga-67 citrate scan revealed three focal areas of increased uptake in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen. The combined Tc-99m SC/Ga-67 scans revealed that these Ga-67 avid lesions localized in the splenic photon-deficit areas found in the Tc-99m SC scan.

42631,Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on psychosocial health and well-being in South-Asian (World Psychiatric Association zone 16) countries: A systematic and advocacy review from the Indian Psychiatric Society,"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has emerged as a global health threat. The South-Asian (SA) countries have witnessed both the initial brunt of the outbreak as well as the ongoing rise of cases. Their unique challenges in relation to mental health during the pandemic are worth exploring. Material(s) and Method(s): A systematic review was conducted for all the original studies on the impact of COVID-19 and lockdown on psychological health/well-being in the SA countries of the World Psychiatric Association Zone 16. PubMed, Google Scholar, PSYCHINFO, EMBASE, and SCOPUS were searched till June 2020. Studies conducted in the age group of 18-60 years with a minimum sample size of 10, and statistically significant results were included. Result(s): Thirteen studies were included in the review. They showed increase prevalence in nonpsychotic depression, anxiety, somatic concerns, alcohol-related disorders, and insomnia in the general population. Psychological symptoms correlated more with physical complaints of fatigue and pain in older adults and were directly related to social media use, misinformation, xenophobia, and social distancing. Frontline workers reported guilt, stigma, anxiety, and poor sleep quality, which were related to the lack of availability of adequate personal protective equipment, increased workload, and discrimination. One study validated the Coronavirus anxiety scale in the Indian population while another explored gaming as a double-edged sword during the lockdown in adolescents. Another study from Bangladesh explored psychosexual health during lockdown. Most studies were cross-sectional online surveys, used screening tools and had limited accessibility. Conclusion(s): The ongoing COVID-19 crisis and its impact serve as an important period for adequate mental healthcare, promotion, research, and holistic biopsychosocial management of psychiatric disorders, especially in vulnerable groups. Mental healthcare and research strategies during the pandemic and preparedness for postpandemic aftermath are advocated subsequently.

Here, we generate a pan-human coronavirus programmable phage display assay to perform proteome-wide profiling of coronavirus antigens enriched by 98 COVID-19 patient sera. Next, we employ ReScan, a method to efficiently sequester phage expressing the most immunogenic peptides and print them onto paper-based microarrays using acoustic liquid handling, which isolates and identifies 9 candidate antigens, 8 of which are derived from the 2 proteins used for SARS-CoV-2 serologic assays: spike and nucleocapsid proteins. After deployment in a high-throughput assay amenable to clinical lab settings, these antigens show improved specificity over a whole protein panel. This proof-of-concept study demonstrates that ReScan will have broad applicability for other emerging infectious diseases or autoimmune diseases that lack a valid biomarker, enabling a seamless pipeline from antigen discovery to diagnostic using one recombinant protein source.

2988,Acute ophthalmic artery occlusion in a COVID-19 patient on apixaban,"We report a case of ophthalmic artery occlusion (OAO) in a young patient with COVID-19 infection that was on therapeutic anticoagulation with apixaban for deep venous thrombosis (DVT). A 48-year-old man with obesity was hospitalized with a severe form of COVID-19 infection, complicated with acute respiratory failure, septic shock, dilated cardiomyopathy and fungemia. Despite treatment with prophylactic enoxaparin (initial D-Dimer 1.14 micro g/ml FEU (normal < 0.05 micro g/ml FEU), D-Dimer increased to above 20 micro g/ml FEU and patient continued to spike high fevers. This prompted further investigations and upper and lower extremities DVTs were confirmed and managed with enoxaparin 1 mg/kg twice daily. D-dimer level decreased to 4.98 micro g/ml FEU while on therapeutic anticoagulation. Three weeks later pending hospital discharge, the anticoagulation was switched to oral apixaban 10 mg twice daily. Patient developed acute severe right eye visual loss of no light perception and was diagnosed with incomplete OAO. D-Dimer was elevated at 2.13 micro g/ml FEU. Stroke etiological work-up found no embolic sources, resolution of the dilated cardiomyopathy and negative antiphospholipid antibodies. Treatment was changed to enoxaparin and no thrombotic events were encountered to date. Ocular vascular complications have not yet been reported in COVID-19. Controversy exists on the best management algorithm for the hypercoagulable state associated to COVID-19 Either direct oral anticoagulants or low-molecular-weight-heparin are considered appropriate at discharge for patients with venous thromboembolism.

50604,Flattening the curve in oncologic surgery: Impact of Covid-19 on surgery at tertiary care cancer center,"INTRODUCTION: Covid-19 has ushered in drastic changes to the healthcare system in order to ""flatten the curve""; in particular, surgical operations that can consume vital, limited resources, not to mention the risk to staff, anesthesiologists, and surgeons. However, under unique circumstances with diligent preparation, vital oncologic operations can be performed safely. METHODS: Prospective comparison of surgical cases during the pandemic from December 2019 to May 2020 to the correlating time frame from December 2018 to May 2019. RESULTS: A significant decline in case volume was not appreciated until the United States declared a national state of emergency, allowing patients with cancer to continue to undergo curative tumor resection until then (428.3 +/- 51.5 vs 166.6 +/- 59.8 cases/week; P < .001). The decrease was consistent with the mean case volume during the holidays (213.8 +/- 76.8 vs 166.6 +/- 59.8 case/week; P = .648). Evaluation of surgical subspecialties demonstrated a significant decrease for all subspecialties with the greatest decline in sarcoma (P = .002) and endocrine (P = .001) surgeries, while vascular (P = .004) and thoracic (P = .011) surgeries had the least.

This study aimed to retrospectively describe the use of corticosteroids in treating COVID-19. Method(s): For this multicenter retrospective study, medical records from 488 symptomatic COVID-19 patients were reviewed. Patients were divided into severe and nonsevere groups. Baseline characteristics, signs and symptoms, laboratory findings, treatments, and disease outcomes were compared. Specific data for corticosteroid treatment were further analyzed. Result(s): Four hundred fifty COVID-19 patients were included in this study, including 82 severe patients and 368 nonsevere cases. Out of the 450 patients, 126 (28.0%) received corticosteroid treatment.

However, corticosteroid use may be accompanied by increased use of antibiotics, longer hospitalization, and prolonged viral shedding.ÁE© Copyright ÁE© 2020 Ma, Zeng, Zhan, Lu, Zeng, He, Liu, Chen, Qin, He, Zhou, Huang, Jiang, Deng, Liao, Xiang, Huang, Chen and Chen.","{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 11}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 11}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'probability': '0.8', 'index': 11}",1,"{'judgement': 'False', 'index': 11}",0,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 11}",1
65554,Hydrocolonic sonography for evaluating inflammatory bowel disease,"OBJECTIVE. The purpose of our study was to compare the usefulness of hydrocolonic sonography and 99mTc-hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime (HMPAO)-labeled leukocyte scintigraphy in the examination of patients with inflammatory bowel disease, using precise sonographic criteria of bowel involvement. SUBJECTS AND METHODS. Sixty-eight consecutive patients with active inflammatory bowel disease (34 ulcerative colitis and 34 Crohn's disease), 12 with inactive inflammatory bowel disease, and 10 control subjects were prospectively studied. Patients with active disease underwent clinical assessment, hydrocolonic sonography, scintigraphy, and colonoscopy within 72 hr, whereas patients with inactive disease and control subjects underwent clinical examination and hydrocolonic sonography. RESULTS. Involvement of a colonic segment by active inflammatory bowel disease was best defined by mucosal thickness greater than 1.5 mm, bowel wall thickness greater than 4 mm, mucosal irregularity, or the absence of haustra; and involvement of the terminal ileum by bowel wall thickness greater than 4 mm. Using these criteria, hydrocolonic sonography had 100% sensitivity for identifying patients with active inflammatory bowel disease and a greater overall accuracy (87%) than scintigraphy (77%) in the assessment of disease extension. In addition, strong correlation was shown between a hydrocolonic sonography activity index and clinical and endoscopic activity indexes. CONCLUSION. This prospective study provides precise sonographic criteria for the definition of bowel involvement by active inflammatory bowel disease. Hydrocolonic sonography has a greater accuracy than scintigraphy for assessing disease extension and activity. Therefore, hydrocolonic sonography should be considered a first-choice technique to complete the study of inflammatory bowel disease after confirmation of the diagnosis by histology.",1,"Hydrocolonic sonography for evaluating inflammatory bowel diseaseOBJECTIVE.

58091,More effective strategies are required to strengthen public awareness of COVID-19: Evidence from Google Trends,"Background: The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has posed stress on the health and well-being of both Chinese people and the public worldwide. Global public interest in this new issue largely reflects people's attention to COVID-19 and their willingness to take precautionary actions. This study aimed to examine global public awareness of COVID-19 using Google Trends. Methods: Using Google Trends, we retrieved public query data for terms of ""2019-nCoV + SARS-CoV-2 + novel coronavirus + new coronavirus + COVID-19 + Corona Virus Disease 2019"" between the 31st December 2019 and the 24th February 2020 in six major English-speaking countries, including the USA, the UK, Canada, Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand. Dynamic series analysis demonstrates the overall change trend of relative search volume (RSV) for the topic on COVID-19. We compared the top-ranking related queries and sub-regions distribution of RSV about COVID-19 across different countries. The correlation between daily search volumes on the topic related to COVID-19 and the daily number of people infected with SARS-CoV-2 was analyzed. Results: The overall search trend of RSV regarding COVID-19 increased during the early period of observing time and reached the first apex on 31st January 2020. A shorter response time and a longer duration of public attention to COVID-19 was observed in public from the USA, the UK, Australia, and Canada, than that in Ireland and New Zealand. A slightly positive correlation between daily RSV about COVID-19 and the daily number of confirmed cases was observed (P < 0.05). People across countries presented a various interest to the RSV on COVID-19, and public awareness of COVID-19 was different in various sub-regions within countries. Conclusions: The results suggest that public response time to COVID-19 was different across countries, and the overall duration of public attention was short. The current study reminds us that governments should strengthen the publicity of COVID-19 nationally, strengthen the public's vigilance and sensitivity to COVID-19, inform public the importance of protecting themselves with enough precautionary measures, and finally control the spread of COVID-19 globally.

8578,External beam radiotherapy followed by 90Y ibritumomab tiuxetan in relapsed or refractory bulky follicular lymphoma.,PURPOSE: We combined external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) with yttrium-90 ibritumomab tiuxetan ((90)Y-IT) in an attempt to improve therapeutic response in patients with relapsed or refractory bulky follicular lymphoma (RRBFL). METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between February 2006 and September 2007  11 patients with RRBFL were treated with EBRT followed by (90)Y-IT. Bulky disease (BD) was defined as >5 cm. EBRT was delivered to BD as 2 400 cGy in eight fractions using computed tomography (CT)-based planning. BD was contoured as the gross tumor volume. A planning margin of 1 to 2 cm was added depending on anatomical location. After recovery of complete blood counts (CBC)  (90)Y-IT was administered at a dose of 0.3 or 0.4 mCi/kg depending on platelet counts. Hematologic toxicity was monitored through weekly CBC. Response was measured by positron emission tomography/CT or CT 3-4 months after (90)Y-IT. RESULTS: Only 2 patients required prolonged breaks between EBRT and (90)Y-IT. The median time after (90)Y-IT for platelets to recover to >100 000/ml was 55 days (range  41-128 days). Platelet counts for 1 patient  who had received 4 previous chemotherapy regimens  never reached 100 000/ml. The complete and overall responses to combined therapy as measured 3-4 months after (90)Y-IT were 64%. No patients relapsed within the EBRT field. With a median follow-up of 36.1 months  6 patients have relapsed  2 of whom have died. Median progression-free survival was 17.5 months. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to prior failure analysis data for RRBFL patients treated with (90)Y-IT alone  a brief course of EBRT prevented relapse in sites of BD. EBRT used to pretreat bulky sites may improve clinical outcomes and potentially extend survival when combined with (90)Y-IT.,0,External beam radiotherapy followed by 90Y ibritumomab tiuxetan in relapsed or refractory bulky follicular lymphoma.PURPOSE: We combined external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) with yttrium-90 ibritumomab tiuxetan ((90)Y-IT) in an attempt to improve therapeutic response in patients with relapsed or refractory bulky follicular lymphoma (RRBFL).

22688,CT image visual quantitative evaluation and clinical classification of coronavirus disease (COVID-19),"OBJECTIVES: To explore the relationship between the imaging manifestations and clinical classification of COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective single-center study on patients with COVID-19 from Jan. 18, 2020 to Feb. 7, 2020 in Zhuhai, China. Patients were divided into 3 types based on Chinese guideline: mild (patients with minimal symptoms and negative CT findings), common, and severe-critical (patients with positive CT findings and different extent of clinical manifestations). CT visual quantitative evaluation was based on summing up the acute lung inflammatory lesions involving each lobe, which was scored as 0 (0%), 1 (1-25%), 2 (26-50%), 3 (51-75%), or 4 (76-100%), respectively. The total severity score (TSS) was reached by summing the five lobe scores. The consistency of two observers was evaluated. The TSS was compared with the clinical classification. ROC was used to test the diagnosis ability of TSS for severe-critical type. RESULTS: This study included 78 patients, 38 males and 40 females. There were 24 mild (30.8%), 46 common (59.0%), and 8 severe-critical (10.2%) cases, respectively. The median TSS of severe-critical-type group was significantly higher than common type (p < 0.001). The ICC value of the two observers was 0.976 (95% CI 0.962-0.985). ROC analysis showed the area under the curve (AUC) of TSS for diagnosing severe-critical type was 0.918. The TSS cutoff of 7.5 had 82.6% sensitivity and 100% specificity. CONCLUSIONS: The proportion of clinical mild-type patients with COVID-19 was relatively high; CT was not suitable for independent screening tool.

37120,Impact of COVID-19 on thyroid cancer surgery and adjunct therapy,"COVID-19 has profoundly modified the way healthcare is delivered. Jordan imposed lockdown and restrictive policies between March 17 and May 20, 2020. We aimed to assess the impact of such measures on thyroid cancer treatment plans. In the specified period, 12 patients were scheduled for surgery. Since papillary carcinoma was the preoperative diagnosis in all cases, radioactive iodine ablation (RIA) therapy was also planned 3-4 weeks following surgery after withdrawing thyroxine and achieving a thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) level > 30 mU/L. Thyroxine withdrawal is the routine method applied for RIA in Jordan as it is less costly compared to the rapid method of exogenous stimulation using recombinant TSH. All surgical procedures were performed without delay since all patients were asymptomatic per flu-like illness and came from a region of low COVID-19 prevalence. These included total thyroidectomy (n = 11), bilateral therapeutic central compartment neck dissection (n = 7), lateral compartment neck dissection (n = 5). However, the RIA treatment plan was altered considerably according to the period in which they were operated. 6 out of the 7 patients operated in March changed to the stimulated method of RIA at a considerable additional extra cost.

2304,Molecular imaging of CXCR4 receptor expression in human cancer xenografts with [64Cu]AMD3100 positron emission tomography,The chemokine receptor CXCR4 and its cognate ligand CXCL12 are pivotal for establishing metastases from many tumor types. Thus  CXCR4 may offer a cell surface target for molecular imaging of metastases  assisting diagnosis  staging  and therapeutic monitoring. Furthermore  noninvasive detection of CXCR4 status of a primary tumor may provide an index of the metastatic potential of the lesion.

Thus  CXCR4 may offer a cell surface target for molecular imaging of metastases  assisting diagnosis  staging  and therapeutic monitoring. Furthermore  noninvasive detection of CXCR4 status of a primary tumor may provide an index of the metastatic potential of the lesion.

66743,"Aliphatic peptides show similar self-assembly to amyloid core sequences, challenging the importance of aromatic interactions in amyloidosis.",The self-assembly of abnormally folded proteins into amyloid fibrils is a hallmark of many debilitating diseases  from Alzheimer's and Parkinson diseases to prion-related disorders and diabetes type II. However  the fundamental mechanism of amyloid aggregation remains poorly understood. Core sequences of four to seven amino acids within natural amyloid proteins that form toxic fibrils have been used to study amyloidogenesis.

34255,Maternal and neonatal characteristics and outcomes among COVID-19 infected women: An updated systematic review and meta-analysis,"Objective: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a global pandemic and may adversely affect pregnancy outcomes. We estimated the adverse maternal and neonatal characteristics and outcomes among COVID-19 infected women and determined heterogeneity in the estimates and associated factors. Study Designs: PubMed search was performed of confirmed COVID-19 pregnant cases and related outcomes were ascertained prior to July 8, 2020, in this systematic review and meta-analysis. Studies reporting premature birth, low birth weight, COVID-19 infection in neonates, or mode of delivery status were included in the study. Two investigators independently performed searches, assessed quality of eligible studies as per the Cochrane handbook recommendations, extracted and reported data according to PRISMA guidelines. Pooled proportions of maternal and neonatal outcomes were estimated using meta-analyses for studies with varying sample sizes while a systematic review with descriptive data analysis was performed for case report studies. Maternal and neonatal outcomes included C-section, premature birth, low birth weight, adverse pregnancy events and COVID transmission in neonates. Result(s): A total of 790 COVID-19 positive females and 548 neonates from 61 studies were analyzed. The rates of C-section, premature birth, low birth weight, and adverse pregnancy events were estimated as 72 %, 23 %, 7 %, and 27 % respectively. In the heterogeneity analysis, the rate of C-section was substantially higher in Chinese studies (91 %) compared to the US (40 %) or European (38 %) studies. The rates of preterm birth and adverse pregnancy events were also lowest in the US studies (12 %, 15 %) compared to Chinese (17 %, 21 %), and European studies (19 %, 19 %). In case reports, the rates of C-section, preterm birth, and low birth weight were estimated as 69 %, 56 %, and 35 %, respectively. Adverse pregnancy outcomes were associated with infection acquired at early gestational ages, more symptomatic presentation, myalgia symptom at presentation, and use of oxygen support therapy. Conclusion(s): Adverse pregnancy outcomes were prevalent in COVID-19 infected females and varied by location, type, and size of the studies.

8542,Cortical sources of EEG rhythms are abnormal in down syndrome.,OBJECTIVE: Previous studies have been inconclusive whether dominant resting state alpha rhythms are greater or lower in amplitude in subjects with Down syndrome (DS) when compared to control subjects  ample resting alpha rhythms being considered as a reflection of good mechanisms of cortical neural synchronization. Here we tested the hypothesis that when the effects of head volume conduction are taken into account by the normalization of the cortical sources of resting alpha rhythms  these sources are lower in amplitude in DS subjects than in controls in line with typical findings in Alzheimer's disease patients. METHODS: Eyes-closed resting electroencephalographic (EEG) data were recorded in 45 DS subjects (25 males; mean age of 22.8years+/-0.7 standard error of mean (SEM)) and in 45 age-matched cognitively normal subjects (25 males; mean age of 22.4years+/-0.5 SEM). EEG rhythms of interest were delta (2-4Hz)  theta (4-8Hz)  alpha 1 (8-10.5Hz)  alpha 2 (10.5-13Hz)  beta 1 (13-20Hz)  beta 2 (20-30Hz)  and gamma (30-40Hz). Cortical EEG sources were estimated by low resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) and normalized across all voxels and frequencies. RESULTS: Central  parietal  occipital  and temporal cortical sources of resting alpha and beta rhythms were lower in amplitude in the DS than control subjects  whereas the opposite was true for occipital delta cortical sources. A control analysis on absolute source values showed that they were globally larger in amplitude across several frequency bands in DS than control subjects. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that normalized cortical sources of alpha rhythms are lower in amplitude in DS than control subjects  as it is typically found in Alzheimer's disease. SIGNIFICANCE: DS is accompanied by a functional impairment of cortical neuronal synchronization mechanisms in the resting state condition.,0,Cortical sources of EEG rhythms are abnormal in down syndrome.OBJECTIVE: Previous studies have been inconclusive whether dominant resting state alpha rhythms are greater or lower in amplitude in subjects with Down syndrome (DS) when compared to control subjects  ample resting alpha rhythms being considered as a reflection of good mechanisms of cortical neural synchronization.

41127,Relationships Between Initial COVID-19 Risk Perceptions and Protective Health Behaviors: A National Survey,"INTRODUCTION: Perceptions of health risks inform decisions about protective behaviors, but COVID-19 was an unfamiliar risk as it began to spread across the U.S. In the initial stage of the epidemic, authors examined perceived risks for COVID-19 infection and infection fatality and whether these risk perceptions were associated with protective behaviors. They also examined whether findings differed between later versus earlier responders. METHODS: Between March 10 and March 31, 2020, a cross-sectional online survey was conducted with a nationally representative U.S. sample (n=6,684). Half responded before March 13, 2020 (versus later). Participants assessed their risks of COVID-19 infection and infection fatality (0%-100%) which were transformed into quartiles (1-4). They reported their implementation of protective behaviors like handwashing and social distancing (yes/no). Analyses were conducted in April-May 2020. RESULTS: Median perceived risk was 10.00% for COVID-19 infection and 5.00% for infection fatality, but respondents showed large disagreement. An increase of 1 quartile in perceived infection risk was associated with being 1.45 times (95% CI=1.33, 1.58) more likely to report handwashing, with perceived infection fatality risk showing no significant association. When predicting social distancing behaviors such as avoiding crowds, both quartile-based risk perceptions were significant (OR=1.24, 95% CI=1.17, 1.30 for infection and OR=1.19, 95% CI=1.13, 1.26 for infection fatality). Perceived COVID-19 infection risk, protective behaviors, and their relationship increased among later (versus earlier) responders. CONCLUSIONS: Despite disagreements about the risks, people perceiving greater risks were more likely to implement protective behaviors-especially later (versus earlier) in March 2020.

46874,Multiplexed proteomic analysis of oxidation and concentrations of cerebrospinal fluid proteins in Alzheimer disease.,BACKGROUND: Carbonylation is an irreversible oxidative modification of proteins that has been linked to various conditions of oxidative stress  aging  physiological disorders  and disease. Increased oxidative stress is thus also considered to play a role in the pathogenesis of age-related neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer disease (AD). In addition  it has recently become evident that the response mechanisms to increased oxidative stress may depend on sex. Several oxidized carbonylated proteins have been identified in plasma and brain of AD patients by use of 2-dimensional oxyblotting. METHODS: In this pilot study  we estimated the concentrations and carbonylation of the most abundant cerebrospinal fluid proteins in aging women and men  both AD patients suffering from mild dementia and individuals exhibiting no cognitive decline. Oxidized carbonylated proteins were analyzed with 2-dimensional multiplexed oxyblotting  mass spectrometry  and database searches. RESULTS: Signals for beta-trace  lambda chain  and transthyretins were decreased in probable AD patients compared with controls. The only identified protein exhibiting an increased degree of carbonylation in AD patients was lambda chain. The concentrations of proteins did not generally differ between men and women; however  vitamin D-binding protein  apolipoprotein A-I  and alpha-1-antitrypsin exhibited higher extents of carbonylation in men. CONCLUSIONS: None of the brain-specific proteins exhibited carbonylation changes in probable AD patients compared with age-matched neurological controls showing no cognitive decline.

For FDG-PET  the average value of grades for glioblastoma  anaplastic astrocytoma and astrocytoma (grade 2) were 4.6  3.9 and 2.5  respectively. Thus  FDG accumulated more in higher grade tumors. On the contrary  the methionine accumulation was observed even in astrocytoma and useful in identifying less malignant tumors.

59627,SARS-CoV-2 detection in the lower respiratory tract of invasively ventilated ARDS patients,"BACKGROUND: Data on SARS-CoV-2 load in lower respiratory tract (LRT) are scarce. Our objectives were to describe the viral shedding and the viral load in LRT and to determine their association with mortality in critically ill COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We conducted a binational study merging prospectively collected data from two COVID-19 reference centers in France and Switzerland. First, we described the viral shedding duration (i.e., time to negativity) in LRT samples. Second, we analyzed viral load in LRT samples. Third, we assessed the association between viral presence in LRT and mortality using mixed-effect logistic models for clustered data adjusting for the time between symptoms' onset and date of sampling. RESULTS: From March to May 2020, 267 LRT samples were performed in 90 patients from both centers. The median time to negativity was 29 (IQR 23; 34) days. Prolonged viral shedding was not associated with age, gender, cardiac comorbidities, diabetes, immunosuppression, corticosteroids use, or antiviral therapy. The LRT viral load tended to be higher in non-survivors. This difference was statistically significant after adjusting for the time interval between onset of symptoms and date of sampling (OR 3.78, 95% CI 1.13-12.64, p = 0.03).

55338,In vivo parahippocampal white matter pathology as a biomarker of disease progression to Alzheimer's disease.,Noninvasive diagnostic tests for Alzheimer's disease (AD) are limited. Postmortem diagnosis is based on density and distribution of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and amyloid-rich neuritic plaques.

48821,CT in relation to rt-PCR in diagnosing covid-19 in the netherlands: A prospective study,"Early differentiation between emergency department (ED) patients with and without corona virus disease (COVID-19) is very important. Chest CT scan may be helpful in early diagnosing of COVID-19. We investigated the diagnostic accuracy of CT using RT-PCR for SARSCoV-2 as reference standard and investigated reasons for discordant results between the two tests. Methods In this prospective single centre study in the Netherlands, all adult symptomatic ED patients had both a CT scan and a RT-PCR upon arrival at the ED. CT results were compared with PCR test(s). Diagnostic accuracy was calculated. Discordant results were investigated using discharge diagnoses. Results Between March 13th and March 24th 2020, 193 symptomatic ED patients were included. In total, 43.0% of patients had a positive PCR and 56.5% a positive CT, resulting in a sensitivity of 89.2%, specificity 68.2%, likelihood ratio (LR)+ 2.81 and LR-0.16. Sensitivity was higher in patients with high risk pneumonia (CURB-65 score ?3; n = 17, 100%) and with sepsis (SOFA score ?2; n = 137, 95.5%). Of the 35 patients (31.8%) with a suspicious CT and a negative RT-PCR, 9 had another respiratory viral pathogen, and in 7 patients, COVID-19 was considered likely. One of nine patients with a non-suspicious CT and a positive PCR had developed symptoms within 48 hours before scanning. Discussion The accuracy of chest CT in symptomatic ED patients is high, but used as a single diagnostic test, CT can not safely diagnose or exclude COVID-19. However, CT can be used as a quick tool to categorize patients into ""probably positive""and ""probably negative""cohorts.Copyright ÁE© 2020 Gietema et al.",1,"CT in relation to rt-PCR in diagnosing covid-19 in the netherlands: A prospective studyEarly differentiation between emergency department (ED) patients with and without corona virus disease (COVID-19) is very important.

The objective of this study was to examine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on hand hygiene performance (HHP) rates in acute care hospitals. METHODS: HHP rates were estimated using an automated hand hygiene monitoring system (AHHMS) installed in 74 adult inpatient units in 7 hospitals and 10 pediatric inpatient units in 2 children's hospitals. A segmented regression model was used to estimate the trajectory of HHP rates in the ten weeks leading up to a COVID-19-related milestone event (eg, school closures) and for ten weeks after. RESULTS: Three effects emerged, all of which were significant at p < .01. Average HHP rates increased from 46% to 56% in the months preceding pandemic-related school closures. This was followed by a 6% upward shift at the time school closures occurred. HHP rates remained over 60% for four weeks before declining to 54% at the end of the study period. CONCLUSION: Data from an AHHMS indicated that HHP shifted in multiple directions during the early stages of the pandemic. We discuss possible reasons why HHP first increased as the pandemic began and then decreased as it progressed. Copyright ÁE© 2020.

This study assessed long-term survival after acute uncomplicated type B dissection comparing medical therapy (MED)  open repair (OPEN)  and TEVAR. Methods: The California Office of Statewide Hospital Planning Development database was analyzed from 2000 to 2010. Patients with emergent admission for aortic dissection were identified  and those with type A dissection  trauma  bowel ischemia  lower extremity ischemia  acidosis  or shock were excluded. The cohort was stratified by treatment type at index admission into MED  OPEN  and TEVAR. Bivariate  multivariable  and survival analyses were used to evaluate the impact of treatment type on long-term overall survival. Results: There were 9165 uncomplicated type B dissections admitted  of which 95% were MED  2.0% OPEN  and 2.9% TEVAR. Mean age was 66±15 years  with 39% female  2.4% cocaine users  18% with congestive heart failure  and 17% with a Charlson comorbidity score >3. Mean length of stay was 6.7±8.9 days in MED  15±15 days in OPEN  and 12±10 days in TEVAR (P < .001); mean inpatient costs were $57 000 MED  $200 000 OPEN  and $130 000 TEVAR (P < .001). Overall inpatient mortality was 6.5%  6.3% for MED  14% for OPEN  and 7.1% for TEVAR (P < .001). Overall 30-day  1-year  and 5-year survival rates were 86%±0.4%  76%±0.4%  and 60%±0.6%; in MED  they were 86%±0.4%  84%±2%  and 60%±0.6%; in OPEN  they were 83%±3%  76%±0.5%  and 67%±4%; and in TEVAR  they were 93%±2%  85%±2%  and 76%±4% respectively (Fig; log-rank  P < .01). On risk-adjusted multivariable analysis  TEVAR improved survival (hazard ratio  0.68 [95% confidence interval  0.55-0.83]; P < .01) compared with MED. Conclusions: This study assessing statewide survival after acute uncomplicated type B dissections shows an independent survival advantage for TEVAR over the long-standing practice of medical therapy. These data add further evidence for a paradigm shift in acute management of type B dissection and support initiation of randomized controlled trials of TEVAR for acute uncomplicated type B dissections.

17146,Copper-induced oxidative damage on astrocytes: protective effect exerted by human high density lipoproteins.,In the present study  we confirmed that copper ions induce oxidative damage in human astrocytes in culture  as demonstrated by the significant increase in the levels of hydroperoxides and in the fluorescence intensity of the fluorescent probe dichloro-dihydrofluorescein diacetate (H(2)DCFDA). The compositional changes were associated with a significant decrease in cell viability in astrocytes treated with 10 microM Cu(++) with respect to control cells. Astrocytes incubated with copper ions in the presence of high density lipoproteins (HDL) isolated from plasma of normolipemic subjects showed lower levels of hydroperoxides and a higher cell viability with respect to cells oxidized alone. Moreover  a significant decrease in the levels of hydroperoxides was observed in oxidized astrocytes treated with HDL. These results demonstrate that HDL exert a protective role against lipid peroxidation. The protective effect could be related to the ability of HDL to bind metal ions at the lipoprotein surface and/or to a stimulation of the efflux of lipid hydroperoxides from cell membranes as demonstrated in other cell types. Oxidative damage of astrocytes was induced at a copper concentration similar to that observed in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients affected by neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's (AD) and Parkinson's diseases (PD). Lipoprotein particles similar for density and chemical composition to plasma HDL were recently isolated in human CSF  therefore  the protective role exerted by HDL against Cu(++)-induced oxidative damage of astrocytes could be of physiological relevance.,0,Copper-induced oxidative damage on astrocytes: protective effect exerted by human high density lipoproteins.In the present study  we confirmed that copper ions induce oxidative damage in human astrocytes in culture  as demonstrated by the significant increase in the levels of hydroperoxides and in the fluorescence intensity of the fluorescent probe dichloro-dihydrofluorescein diacetate (H(2)DCFDA). The compositional changes were associated with a significant decrease in cell viability in astrocytes treated with 10 microM Cu(++) with respect to control cells. Astrocytes incubated with copper ions in the presence of high density lipoproteins (HDL) isolated from plasma of normolipemic subjects showed lower levels of hydroperoxides and a higher cell viability with respect to cells oxidized alone. Moreover  a significant decrease in the levels of hydroperoxides was observed in oxidized astrocytes treated with HDL. These results demonstrate that HDL exert a protective role against lipid peroxidation.

67438,Modern Senicide in the Face of a Pandemic: An Examination of Public Discourse and Sentiment about Older Adults and COVID-19 Using Machine Learning,"OBJECTIVES: This study examined public discourse and sentiment regarding older adults and COVID-19 on social media and assessed the extent of ageism in public discourse. METHODS: Twitter data (N=82,893) related to both older adults and COVID-19 and dated from January 23 to May 20, 2020, were analyzed. We used a combination of data science methods (including Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count, supervised machine learning, topic modeling, and sentiment analysis), qualitative thematic analysis, and conventional statistics. RESULTS: The most common category in the coded tweets was ""personal opinions"" (66.2%), followed by ""informative"" (24.7%), ""jokes/ridicule"" (4.8%), and ""personal experiences"" (4.3%). The daily average of ageist content was 18%, with the highest of 52.8% on March 11, 2020. Specifically, more than one in ten (11.5%) tweets implied that the life of older adults is less valuable or downplayed the pandemic because it mostly harms older adults. A small proportion (4.6%) explicitly supported the idea of just isolating older adults. Almost three-quarters (72.9%) within ""jokes/ridicule"" targeted older adults, half of which were ""death jokes."" Also, 14 themes were extracted, such as perceptions of lockdown and risk. A bivariate Granger causality test suggested that informative tweets regarding at-risk populations increased the prevalence of tweets that downplayed the pandemic. DISCUSSION: Ageist content in the context of COVID-19 was prevalent on Twitter. Information about COVID-19 on Twitter influenced public perceptions of risk and acceptable ways of controlling the pandemic. Public education on the risk of severe illness is needed to correct misperceptions. Copyright ÁE© The Author(s) 2020.

52984,The balance between cognitive reserve and brain imaging biomarkers of cerebrovascular and Alzheimer's diseases.,The cognitive reserve hypothesis explains the disparity between clinical and pathological phenotypes and why  in two individuals with the same extent of neuropathology  one may be demented while the other remains cognitively intact. We examined the balance between brain magnetic resonance imaging measures of the two most common pathologies associated with brain ageing  cerebrovascular disease and Alzheimer's disease  and parameters of cerebral reserve in well-characterized participants born in 1936  for whom childhood intelligence is known. Brain magnetic resonance imaging was carried out at 1.5T using fluid attenuation inversion recovery and T(1)-weighted volumetric sequences in 249 participants. Cerebrovascular disease was quantified by measuring brain white matter hyperintensities on fluid attenuation inversion recovery images using Scheltens' scale and Alzheimer's disease was measured from volumetric data using FreeSurfer to extract whole brain volume and hippocampal volumes in turn. The effect of these measures of brain burden on life-long cognitive ageing from the age of 11 to 68 years was compared with the effect of educational attainment and occupational grade using structural equation modelling. Complete brain burden and reserve data were available in 224 participants. We found that educational attainment  but not occupation  has a measurable and positive effect  with a standardized regression weight of +0.23  on late life cognitive ability in people without cognitive impairment aged 68 years  allowing for the influence of childhood intelligence and the two most common subclinical brain pathological burdens in the ageing brain. In addition  we demonstrate that the magnitude of the contribution of education is greater than the negative impact of either neuropathological burden alone  with standardized regression weights of -0.14 for white matter hyperintensities and -0.20 for hippocampal atrophy. This study illustrates how education counteracts the deleterious effects of cerebrovascular disease and Alzheimer's disease and highlights the importance of quantifying cognitive reserve in dementia research.,0,The balance between cognitive reserve and brain imaging biomarkers of cerebrovascular and Alzheimer's diseases.The cognitive reserve hypothesis explains the disparity between clinical and pathological phenotypes and why  in two individuals with the same extent of neuropathology  one may be demented while the other remains cognitively intact.

Baseline 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography of 36 patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment who converted to Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia after an average time of 2 years (pAD) and of 105 CTR were processed. The area of hypometabolism in pAD showed less metabolic connectivity in patients than in CTR (autocorrelation and correlation with large temporal and frontal areas  respectively). pAD patients showed limited correlation even in selected nonhypometabolic areas  including the hippocampi and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLFC). On the contrary  in CTR group correlation was highlighted between hippocampi and precuneus/posterior cingulate and frontal cortex  and between dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and caudate nuclei and parietal cortex. The reduced metabolic connections both in hypometabolic and nonhypometabolic areas in pAD patients suggest that metabolic disconnection (reflecting early diaschisis) may antedate remote hypometabolism (early sign of synaptic degeneration).,0,Resting metabolic connectivity in prodromal Alzheimer's disease.

23647,Factors influencing health behaviours during the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak in China: an extended information-motivation-behaviour skills model,"OBJECTIVES: This study explored the factors influencing health behaviours during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in China. The impact of perceived stress and positive perception of interventions on health behaviours in China were assessed using the extended information-motivation-behaviour skills (IMB) model. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. METHODS: The Questionstar online survey tool was used to construct a structured questionnaire based on the IMB model. Between 14 and 22 February 2020, during the peak of COVID-19 epidemic in China, 2449 participants were recruited by snowball sampling on WeChat and Tencent QQ social media platforms in China. Data were collected through an online questionnaire, and structural equation modelling was performed to evaluate the extended IMB model. RESULTS: Health behaviours were assessed using a scoring system (total score range: 8-40); the average health behaviour score in this study was 34.62 +/- 4.44. The term 'health risk stress' refers to the impact that perceived stress has on health, and this was experienced by 39.9% of participants. Only 35.9% of participants answered all seven questions on COVID-19 information correctly. The final model showed that information, motivation, behavioural skills, heath risk stress and positive perception of interventions had significant direct effects on health behaviours. Health behaviours were positively associated with the positive perception of interventions but negatively associated with health risk stress. Behavioural skills had the greatest impact on health behaviours. CONCLUSIONS: In the face of public health emergencies, the extended IMB model has been used as a theoretical framework to construct more effective interventions. The government should pay attention to publicity and guidance, strengthen positive interactions with the public and disclose relevant information in a timely manner to gain trust and to maintain the positive public perception of the interventions. In terms of health education, the government should focus on behavioural skills, promptly rectify ineffective prevention information and raise awareness about the disease to relieve stress and anxiety in the population.

METHODS: Using a prospective design, participants (N=2,094) were first assessed in early February 2020 before the coronavirus crisis in the United States and again in mid-March 2020 during the President's 15 Days to Slow the Spread guidelines. Weight, height, and weight discrimination were assessed in the February survey. Psychological, behavioral, and interpersonal responses to the coronavirus were assessed in the March survey. RESULTS: Pre-pandemic experiences with weight discrimination were associated with greater concerns about the virus, engaging in more preventative behaviors, less trust in people and institutions to manage the outbreak, and greater perceived declines in connection to one's community. BMI tended to be unrelated to these responses. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the risks of complications of COVID-19 associated with obesity, individuals with higher BMI were neither more concerned about the virus nor taking more behavioral precautions than individuals in other weight categories. Weight discrimination, in contrast, may heighten vigilance to threat, which may have contributed to both positive (greater concern, more precautionary behavior) and negative (less trust, declines community connection) responses to the pandemic.

16704,Arundic Acid ameliorates cerebral amyloidosis and gliosis in Alzheimer transgenic mice.,Like microglia  reactive astrocytes produce a myriad of neurotoxic substances in various brain pathologies  such as Alzheimer's disease (AD)  trauma  and cerebral ischemia. Among the numerous products of reactive astrocytes  attention has recently been directed toward the possible detrimental role of S100B  because the protein has been shown to be highly expressed along with the progression of brain damage and to exert neurotoxic effects at high concentrations. The present study aimed to examine the possible role of astrocyte-derived S100B in the progression of cerebral amyloidosis and gliosis in transgenic mice overproducing mutant amyloid precursor protein (Tg APP(sw) mice  line 2576). For this purpose  arundic acid (Ono Pharmaceutical Co.  Ltd.  Mishima  Osaka  Japan)  which is known to negatively regulate astrocyte synthesis of S100B  was orally administered to Tg APP(sw) mice for 6 months from 12 months of age  and the effects of the agent on the above parameters were examined. Here  we report that beta-amyloid deposits along with amyloid-beta peptide/S100B levels  as well as beta-amyloid plaque-associated reactive gliosis (astrocytosis and microgliosis)  were significantly ameliorated in arundic acid-treated Tg APP(sw) mice relative to vehicle-treated Tg APP(sw) mice at 19 months of age. Based on the above results  arundic acid is considered to deserve further exploration as a promising therapeutic agent for AD.,0,Arundic Acid ameliorates cerebral amyloidosis and gliosis in Alzheimer transgenic mice.Like microglia  reactive astrocytes produce a myriad of neurotoxic substances in various brain pathologies  such as Alzheimer's disease (AD)  trauma  and cerebral ischemia.

The main differential diagnoses include: drug hypersensitivity  infections  neoplasms  Systemic Lupus Erythematosus  Behcet syndrome  sarcoidosis. We present a case of RAM  produced by a chronic infection of Herpex Simplex Virus type 2 (HSV-2) also known as Mollaret's Meningitis (MM). This is a 34 year old male  with a history of 3 episodes of aseptic meningitis of unknown etiology in the last 8 years  fully recovering after each episode. He presented to the emergency center with a 2 day history of severe frontal and retroorbital pain with radiation to the nape of the neck  associated with fever  photophobia and neck stiffness. On physical examination the patient was afebrile with stable vital signs. His exam was negative for Kernig and Brudzinski signs and laboratory exams were within normal limits.

HIV  ANA  Head CTand MRI were negative. CSF PCR was negative for enterovirus but positive for HSV-2 (437 copies/ml). The patient was treated with IV acyclovir for 14 days  without any complications. Pierre Mollaret first described MM in 1944. MM is a benign RAM characterized by episodes of fever and signs of meningeal irritation lasting between 2 and 5 days. It is also associated with spontaneous recovery and a lymphocytic pleocytosis in the CSF. The most common etiology found in MM is HSV-2  and less commonly: Echovirus  Coxsackie  Epstein Barr Virus. Various authors recommend checking for HSV-2 PCR in CSF between the 2nd and 5th day of symptom onset. Treatment is with intravenous acyclovir (10 mg/kg/q8h for 10-21 days). Suppressive treatment for frequent relapses has been described  with oral acyclovir  valacyclovir or famciclovir; due to the rarity of the disease no randomized controlled trials have been performed.,0,Recurrent aseptic meningitis: A case of mollaret's meningitisCase Report: Recurrent Aseptic Meningitis (RAM) is a medical condition with multiple possible etiologies that presents a challenging clinical dilemma.

Results in normal subjects and brain tumour and stroke patients,Values of regional cerebral oxygen extraction ratio and oxygen utilisation obtained with the oxygen-15 steady-state inhalation technique have been found to be overestimated due to the signal from intravascular oxygen-15. A previously described method to correct for this intravascular component has been applied to a series of studies on normal subjects  and on brain tumour and stroke patients. With this correction the regional cerebral oxygen extraction ratio in normals becomes comparable to the global values previously reported with arteriovenous sampling techniques. Within the lesions of brain tumour and stroke patients  the corrections have been found to be variable and often substantial. It is concluded that failure to apply this correction may result in major errors in the values for regional oxygen extraction ratio and oxygen utilisation. This is especially true when the regional blood flow and oxygen extraction ratio of a tissue is low and regional blood volume is high,0,Correction for the presence of intravascular oxygen-15 in the steady-state technique for measuring regional oxygen extraction ratio in the brain: 2.

61766,Reducing perceived health risk to attract hotel customers in the COVID-19 pandemic era: Focused on technology innovation for social distancing and cleanliness,"As an essential risk-reduction strategy, technology innovation is likely to play a key role in the hotel industry's recovery from the 2020 coronavirus pandemic. However, its impact on customer decision-making behavior is unknown. Focusing on technology innovation for reducing guest interaction with employees and enhancing cleanliness, the purpose of this research was to examine the impact of expected interaction and expected cleanliness on perceived health risk and hotel booking intention. Three experimental studies were conducted using online consumer samples. The studies found that low levels of expected interaction through technology-mediated systems lead to low levels of perceived health risk. Perceived health risk mediates the relationship between expected interaction and hotel booking intention. In addition, high levels of expected cleanliness through advanced cleaning technologies moderate the impacts of expected interaction on perceived health risk. Importantly, the proposed perceived risk mechanism was effective in post-pandemic scenarios. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed. Copyright ÁE© 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

However  it is still not clear how these processes correlate with grey matter (GM) volume and microstructural changes in the brain. OBJECTIVE: To assess the relationship between CSF biomarkers and structural brain changes in AD. DESIGN AND SETTING: Cross-sectional study in a memory clinic-based sample. SUBJECTS: A total of 78 subjects were included in the study: 22 with subjective cognitive impairment (SCI)  35 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 21 with AD. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Voxel-wise correlations between CSF biomarkers  including EEE-amyloid42 (AEEE42)  tau phosphorylated at position threonine 181 and total tau protein  and GM volume  self-diffusion fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) maps using voxel-based morphometry and tract-based spatial statistical analyses.

CASE REPORT We describe the case of an 8-year-old boy admitted with status epilepticus, who also tested positive for COVID-19, while afebrile, with no initial respiratory symptoms. Benzodiazepines were given per treatment guidelines, abating the seizure activity. He subsequently developed respiratory distress and desaturation requiring temporary emergent intubation. All clinical symptoms resolved within a few hours. Results of a computed tomography (CT) scan of the brain were within normal limits. Results of a 24-h electroencephalogram (EEG) were abnormal, indicative of diffuse cerebral dysfunction.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We compared the cost-effectiveness of MRI+CLP to that of standard diagnosis using currently available cognition tests and of standard MRI  and investigated the impact of a hypothetical treatment efficient in early AD. The primary analysis was based on the current French context for 70-year-old patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). In alternative ""screen and treat"" scenarios  we analyzed the consequences of systematic screenings of over-60 individuals (either population-wide or restricted to the ApoE4 genotype population). We used a Markov model of AD progression; model parameters  as well as incurred costs and quality-of-life weights in France were taken from the literature. We performed univariate and probabilistic multivariate sensitivity analyses. The base-case preferred strategy was the standard MRI diagnosis strategy. In the primary analysis however  MRI+CLP could become the preferred strategy under a wide array of scenarios involving lower cost and/or higher sensitivity or specificity. By contrast  in the ""screen and treat"" analyses  the probability of MRI+CLP becoming the preferred strategy remained lower than 5%. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: It is thought that anti-beta-amyloid compounds might halt the development of dementia in early stage patients.

1108,Moderate or Severe Impairment in Pulmonary Function is Associated with Mortality in Sarcoidosis Patients Infected with SARS-CoV-2,"PURPOSE: To investigate whether sarcoidosis patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 are at risk for adverse disease outcomes. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted in five hospitals within the Mount Sinai Health System during March 1, 2020 to July 29, 2020. All patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were included in the study. We identified sarcoidosis patients who met diagnostic criteria for sarcoidosis according to accepted guidelines. An adverse disease outcome was defined as the presence of intubation and mechanical ventilation or in-hospital mortality. In sarcoidosis patients, we reported (when available) the results of pulmonary function testing measured within 3 years prior to the time of SARS-CoV-2 infection. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to generate an adjusted odds ratio (aOR) to evaluate sarcoidosis as a risk factor for an adverse outcome. The same model was used to analyze sarcoidosis patients with moderate and/or severe impairment in pulmonary function. RESULTS: The study included 7337 patients, 37 of whom (0.5%) had sarcoidosis. The crude rate of developing an adverse outcome was significantly higher in patients with moderately and/or severely impaired pulmonary function (9/14 vs. 3/23, p = 0.003). While the diagnosis of sarcoidosis was not independently associated with risk of an adverse event, (aOR 1.8, 95% CI 0.9-3.6), the diagnosis of sarcoidosis in patients with moderately and/or severely impaired pulmonary function was associated with an adverse outcome (aOR 7.8, 95% CI 2.4-25.8).

62905,"Disparate on-site access to water, sanitation, and food storage heighten the risk of COVID-19 spread in Sub-Saharan Africa","COVID-19 is an active pandemic that likely poses an existential threat to humanity. Frequent handwashing, social distancing, and partial or total lockdowns are among the suite of measures prescribed by the World Health Organization (WHO) and being implemented across the world to contain the pandemic. However, existing inequalities in access to certain basic necessities of life (water, sanitation facility, and food storage) create layered vulnerabilities to COVID-19 and can render the preventive measures ineffective or simply counterproductive. We hypothesized that individuals in households without any of the named basic necessities of life are more likely to violate the preventive (especially lockdown) measures and thereby increase the risk of infection or aid the spread of COVID-19. Based on nationally-representative data for 25 sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries, multivariate statistical and geospatial analyses were used to investigate whether, and to what extent, household family structure is associated with in-house access to basic needs which, in turn, could reflect on a higher risk of COVID-19 infection. The results indicate that approximately 46% of the sampled households in these countries (except South Africa) did not have in-house access to any of the three basic needs and about 8% had access to all the three basic needs. Five countries had less than 2% of their households with in-house access to all three basic needs. Ten countries had over 50% of their households with no in-house access to all the three basic needs. There is a social gradient in in-house access between the rich and the poor, urban and rural richest, male- and female-headed households, among others. We conclude that SSA governments would need to infuse innovative gender- and age-sensitive support services (such as water supply, portable sanitation) to augment the preventive measures prescribed by the WHO. Short-, medium- and long-term interventions within and across countries should necessarily address the upstream, midstream and downstream determinants of in-house access and the full spectrum of layers of inequalities including individual, interpersonal, institutional, and population levels.Copyright ÁE© 2020 Elsevier Inc.",0,"Disparate on-site access to water, sanitation, and food storage heighten the risk of COVID-19 spread in Sub-Saharan AfricaCOVID-19 is an active pandemic that likely poses an existential threat to humanity.

31921,Distancing Bonus Or Downscaling Loss? The Changing Livelihood of Us Online Workers in Times of COVID-19,"We draw on data from the Online Labour Index and interviews with freelancers in the United States securing work on online platforms, to illuminate effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic's global economic upheaval is shuttering shops and offices. Those able to do so are now working remotely from their homes. They join workers who have always been working remotely: freelancers who earn some or all of their income from projects secured via online labour platforms. Data allow us to sketch a first picture of how the initial months of the COVID-19 pandemic have affected the livelihoods of online freelancers. The data shows online labour demand falling rapidly in early March 2020, but with an equally rapid recovery. We also find significant differences between countries and occupations.

6574,Students' and lecturers' perspective on the implementation of online learning in dental education due to SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19): a cross-sectional study,"BACKGROUND: On account of physical distancing measures, universities worldwide are strongly affected by SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19). Thus, the dental school of Justus-Liebig-University Giessen (Germany) transferred the established ""face-to-face"" learning to online learning in the spring term 2020. The aim of this study was to assess the students' and lecturers' perspectives on the implementation of online learning due to COVID-19, using a questionnaire survey. METHODS: After the online period, all students and lecturers were asked to fill out an online questionnaire containing evaluative statements regarding handling, didactic benefit, motivation, and overall assessment. Furthermore, the questionnaire for lecturers contained additional aspects regarding knowledge gain in terms of providing online learning. Besides that, students and lecturers were asked for the amount of online learning in the future curriculum (independent of COVID-19). Data were subjected to regression analysis and T-test (p < .05). RESULTS: 36.8% of students preferred ""face-to-face"" learning instead of sole online learning. An increase of know how concerning online teaching was observable for lecturers. Both, students and lecturers, want to keep up with online courses in the future curriculum. However, in terms of the optimal amount of online learning a significant difference between students' and lecturers' perspective was observed. While students suggested 53.2% (24.9) (mean (standard deviation)) lecturers only stated 38.6% (21.5).

65426,Elevated levels of neural recognition molecule L1 in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with Alzheimer disease and other dementia syndromes.,In this study we surveyed a total of 218 cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from patients with different neurological diseases including Alzheimer disease  non-Alzheimer forms of dementia  other neurodegenerative diseases without dementia and normal controls to quantitate by capture ELISA the concentrations of the immunoglobulin superfamily adhesion molecules L1 and NCAM  and characterized by immunoblot analysis the molecular forms of L1 and NCAM. We found a significant increase of L1 and a strong tendency for increase of the soluble fragments of NCAM in the CSF of Alzheimer patients compared to the normal control group. The proteolytic fragments of L1  but not NCAM were also elevated in patients with vascular dementia and dementia of mixed type. Higher L1 concentrations were observed irrespective of age and gender. NCAM concentrations were independent of gender  but positively correlated with age and  surprisingly  also with incidence of multiple sclerosis. Thus  there was an influence of Alzheimer and non-Alzheimer dementias and neurodegeneration on L1  whereas age and neurodegeneration influenced NCAM concentrations. These observations point to an abnormal processing and/or shedding of L1 and NCAM in dementia-related neurodegeneration and age  respectively  reflecting changes in adhesion molecule-related cell interactions.,0,Elevated levels of neural recognition molecule L1 in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with Alzheimer disease and other dementia syndromes.In this study we surveyed a total of 218 cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from patients with different neurological diseases including Alzheimer disease  non-Alzheimer forms of dementia  other neurodegenerative diseases without dementia and normal controls to quantitate by capture ELISA the concentrations of the immunoglobulin superfamily adhesion molecules L1 and NCAM  and characterized by immunoblot analysis the molecular forms of L1 and NCAM.

36264,Epidemiology and clinical features of emergency department patients with suspected COVID-19: Results from the first month of the COVED Quality Improvement Project (COVED-2),"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to describe the epidemiological and clinical features of emergency department (ED) patients with suspected and confirmed COVID-19. METHODS: The COVID-19 Emergency Department (COVED) Project is an ongoing prospective cohort study that includes all adult patients presenting to The Alfred Hospital ED who undergo testing for SARS-CoV-2. Current guidelines recommend testing for patients with fevers or chills, acute respiratory symptoms or a high-risk exposure history, as well as implementation of infection control and prevention (IPC) precautions for all suspected and confirmed cases. Study outcomes include a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result and intensive respiratory support. RESULTS: In the period 1-30 April 2020, 702 of 3453 ED patients (20%; 95%CI: 19-22) were tested, with a significant increase during the study period (IRR 1.019; 95%CI: 1.017-1.021, p<0.001). The primary outcome of a positive SARS-CoV-2 test was recorded in 14 patients (2%; 95%CI: 1-3). Shortness of breath (77%), fatigue (100%), myalgia (67%) and diarrhoea (67%) were common among positive cases, while close contact (9%), fever (0%) and healthcare occupation (0%) were not. No positive cases required intensive respiratory support in the ED. CONCLUSIONS: The volume of ED patients with suspected COVID-19 is increasing. Low numbers of positive cases precluded development of accurate predictive tools, but the COVED Project is fulfilling an important role in monitoring the burden of IPC requirements on the ED. The increasing number of patients meeting isolation criteria has the potential to impact on patient flow and may lead to ED overcrowding. Copyright This article is protected by copyright.

Sequential proteolysis of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by beta- and gamma-secretases produces Abeta1-40/42  but beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1)  the major beta-secretase  also generates Abeta11-40/42  and BACE1 overexpression in cultured cells results primarily in secretion of Abeta11-40/42. The ratio of Abeta11-40/42 to Abeta1-40/42 depends on the ratio of BACE1 to APP  and Abeta11-40/42 can be generated from both full-length APP and its carboxy-terminal fragment (C99). Here  we investigated the role of Abeta11-40/42 in the pathogenesis of AD and Down's syndrome (DS) brains. We demonstrated significant amount of Abeta11-42 in DS brains by Western blots. While pyroAbeta11-42-modified Abeta species existed predominantly in mature SP cores in AD brain sections  both unmodified free Abeta11-40 and pyro-modified Abeta11-40 are detected in vascular amyloid deposits by immunohistochemistry.

Using two different TBM designs (averaging individual differences versus aligning group average templates)  we compared the anatomical distribution of brain atrophy in 40 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD)  40 healthy elderly controls  and 40 individuals with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI)  a condition conferring increased risk for AD. We created an unbiased geometrical average image template for each of the three groups  which were matched for sex and age (mean age: 76.1 years+/-7.7 SD). We warped each individual brain image (N=120) to the control group average template to create Jacobian maps  which show the local expansion or compression factor at each point in the image  reflecting individual volumetric differences. Statistical maps of group differences revealed widespread medial temporal and limbic atrophy in AD  with a lesser  more restricted distribution in MCI. Atrophy and CSF space expansion both correlated strongly with Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) scores and Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR). Using cumulative p-value plots  we investigated how detection sensitivity was influenced by the sample size  the choice of search region (whole brain  temporal lobe  hippocampus)  the initial linear registration method (9- versus 12-parameter)  and the type of TBM design.

10346,Comorbidity and prognostic factors on admission in a COVID-19 cohort of a general hospital,"ANTECEDENTS AND OBJECTIVE: To describe clinical features, comorbidity, and prognostic factors associated with in-hospital mortality in a cohort of COVID-19 admitted to a general hospital. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective cohort study of patients with COVID-19 admitted from 26th February, who had been discharged or died, up to 29th April, 2020. A descriptive study and an analysis of factors associated with intrahospital mortality were performed. RESULTS: Out of the 101 patients, 96 were analysed. Of these, 79 (82%) recovered and were discharged, and 17 (18%) died in the hospital. Diagnosis of COVID-19 was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction to SARS-CoV-2 in 92 (92.5%). The mean age was 63 years, and 66% were male. The most frequent comorbidities were hypertension (40%), diabetes mellitus (16%) and cardiopathy (14%). Patients who died were older (mean 77 vs 60 years), had higher prevalence of hypertension (71% vs 33%), and cardiopathy (47% vs 6%), and higher levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and reactive C protein (mean 662 vs 335UI/L, and 193 vs 121mg/L respectively) on admission. In a multivariant analysis the variables significantly associated to mortality were the presence of cardiopathy (CI 95% OR 2,58-67,07), levels of LDH>=345IU/L (CI 95% OR 1,52-46,00), and age>=65 years (CI 95% OR 1,23-44,62). CONCLUSIONS: The presence of cardiopathy, levels of LDH>=345IU/L and age >=65 years are associated with a higher risk of death during hospital stay for COVID-19.

20396,Clinical application of Chemiluminescence Microparticle Immunoassay for SARS-CoV-2 infection diagnosis,"Background: The unsatisfactory accuracy and capacity of real time RT-PCR depends on several unavoidable reasons, which cannot meet the demands for COVID-19 diagnosis. Method(s): 206 serum samples were collected from patients who were treated in the General Hospital of the Central Theater Command of the PLA between January 18 and April 4, 2020. 270 serum samples from healthy blood donors were used as control. IgM and total antibodies (Ab) against SARS-CoV-2 were detected by Chemiluminescence Microparticle Immunoassay (CMIA). Result(s): Among the 206 patients, the positive rate of IgM and Ab were 149/206 (72.3 %) and 187/206 (90.8 %), respectively. And the specificity of IgM and Ab detection were 99.3 % and 98.9 %, respectively. The sensitivity of CMIA for Ab detection was significantly higher than that of IgM. An increase of the positive rate and S/CO value for detecting IgM and Ab accompanied with the increasing of days post-disease onset (d.p.o.) were observed. The positive rate of Ab detected by CMIA increased rapidly after 7 d.p.o., while that of IgM was obviously increased after 14 d.p.o. In addition, the age and gender of these patients did not affect the seroconversion and titer of antibodies during the whole course. The disease-severity of patients had no effect on the seroconversion of antibodies. However, the critical patients possessed a much higher antibody titers than the no-critical cases after 14 d.p.o. Conclusion(s): The CMIA can provide important complementation to nucleic acid assay and help to enhance the accuracy and capacity of diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection.Copyright ÁE© 2020",1,"Clinical application of Chemiluminescence Microparticle Immunoassay for SARS-CoV-2 infection diagnosisBackground: The unsatisfactory accuracy and capacity of real time RT-PCR depends on several unavoidable reasons, which cannot meet the demands for COVID-19 diagnosis.

19983,Attenuation of AD-like neuropathology by harnessing peripheral immune cells: local elevation of IL-10 and MMP-9.,Immunization with an altered myelin-derived peptide (MOG45D) improves recovery from acute CNS insults  partially via recruitment of monocyte-derived macrophages that locally display a regulatory activity. Here  we investigated the local alterations in the cellular and molecular immunological milieu associated with attenuation of Alzheimer's disease-like pathology following immunotherapy. We found that immunization of amyloid precursor protein/presenilin 1 double-transgenic mice with MOG45D peptide  loaded on dendritic cells  led to a substantial reduction of parenchymal and perivascular amyloid beta (Abeta)-plaque burden and soluble Abeta((1-42)) peptide levels as well as reduced astrogliosis and levels of a key glial scar protein (chondroitin sulphate proteoglycan). These changes were associated with a shift in the local innate immune response  manifested by increased Iba1+/CD45(high) macrophages that engulfed Abeta  reduced pro-inflammatory (tumor necrosis factor-alpha) and increased anti-inflammatory (interleukin-10) cytokines  as well as a significant increase in growth factors (IGF-1 and TGFbeta) in the brain. Furthermore  the levels of matrix metalloproteinase-9  an enzyme shown to degrade Abeta and is associated with glial scar formation  were significantly elevated in the brain following immunization. Altogether  these results indicate that boosting systemic immune cells leads to a local immunomodulation manifested by elevated levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines and metalloproteinases that contribute to ameliorating Alzheimer's disease pathology.,0,Attenuation of AD-like neuropathology by harnessing peripheral immune cells: local elevation of IL-10 and MMP-9.Immunization with an altered myelin-derived peptide (MOG45D) improves recovery from acute CNS insults  partially via recruitment of monocyte-derived macrophages that locally display a regulatory activity.

63560,Clinical Outcomes of Patients with Asthma with Covid-19 Pneumonia,"SESSION TITLE: Chest Infections Posters SESSION TYPE: Original Investigation Posters PRESENTED ON: October 18-21, 2020 PURPOSE: The novel Sars-CoV-2 virus causes a viral pneumonia (COVID-19) and corticosteroids have been shown to prolong viral shedding and may increase mortality in viral pneumonias(1). Patients with asthma typically require inhaled corticosteroids. It is unknown if asthmatics will therefore have worse outcomes as a result. METHOD(S): This is a retrospective cohort study of asthmatics compared to the general population diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia from a multicenter health system in Kansas City. The primary outcome is admission to a hospital. Secondary outcomes include mechanical ventilatory support and in-hospital all-cause mortality. RESULT(S): In this cohort, asthmatics had an average BMI of 32.9 +- 3.2, as compared to 31.2+-0.8 in the general population. Mean age is 49.0 +- 6.0 vs 54+-1.79. As of 5/1/2020 there have been 345 patients positive for COVID 19. 24 have asthma. 7/24 with asthma (29.2%) vs 79/321 non-asthmatics (24.6%, OR 1.26, p=0.6) have required admission to a hospital. 2/24 (8.3%) asthmatics have required mechanical ventilation vs 17/321 (5.2%, OR 1.49, p=0.6) non-asthmatics. 0 asthmatics have died and 7/321 (2.8%, OR 0.8, p=0.9) non-asthmatics have died.

54822,Preoperative imaging of Charcot neuroarthropathy: Does the additional application of (18)F-FDG-PET make sense?,With about 4 million diabetics in germany and presumed inclination over the following years the treatment of diabetic complications like diabetic foot will become an even more important point. The management of Charcot's foot has undergone fundamental change in the last few years. Formerly  treatment was almost exclusively limited to non surgical measures; since the late 1990's  however  current practice has shifted to early  stage-appropriate surgical therapy. The aim of the present prospective study was to investigate the value of positron emission tomography (PET) in the pre-operative work-up of Charcot's foot. PET were compared to magnetic resonance tomography (MRI). PATIENTS  METHODS: MRI and PET imaging were used as part of the preoperative work-up in 18 patients with Type II diabetes mellitus. The diagnosis of Charcot's foot requiring surgical treatment were made on the basis of clinical and radiologic criteria. RESULTS: Of 46 Charcot's lesions confirmed at surgery  44 and 35 were detected by means of PET and MRI  respectively. PET can be used in the work-up of patients with metal implants where the MRI does not show adequate findings. PET shows the areas of detritus formation exhibit only moderately increased glucose metabolism and at visual interpretation do not usually impression as typical for acute osteomyelitis. Average SUV values stood at 1.2 (range: 0.5-2.9). CONCLUSIONS: The differentiation between Charcot's lesions and florid osteomyelitis provides the surgeon with important additional information  which is often unavailable from MRI. Because of this important additional data  PET could be considered preferable to morphologic imaging (CT  projection radiography) in the preoperative work-up of Charcot's foot.,0,Preoperative imaging of Charcot neuroarthropathy: Does the additional application of (18)F-FDG-PET make sense?With about 4 million diabetics in germany and presumed inclination over the following years the treatment of diabetic complications like diabetic foot will become an even more important point.

66954,Three- and four-repeat Tau coassemble into heterogeneous filaments: an implication for Alzheimer disease.,Tau filaments are the pathological hallmark of numerous neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer disease  Pick disease  and progressive supranuclear palsy. In the adult human brain  six isoforms are expressed that differ by the presence or absence of the second of four semiconserved repeats. As a consequence  half of the tau isoforms have three repeats (3R tau)  whereas the other half of the isoforms have four repeats (4R tau). Tauopathies can be characterized based on the isoform composition of their filaments. Alzheimer disease filamentous inclusions contain all isoforms. Pick disease filaments contain 3R tau. Progressive supranuclear palsy filaments contain 4R tau. Here  we used site-directed spin labeling of recombinant tau in conjunction with electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy to obtain structural insights into these filaments. We find that filaments of 4R tau and 3R tau share a highly ordered core structure in the third repeat with parallel  in-register arrangement of EEE-strands. This structure is conserved regardless of whether full-length isoforms (htau40 and htau23) or truncated constructs (K18 and K19) are used. When mixed  3R tau and 4R tau coassemble into heterogeneous filaments. These filaments share the highly ordered core in the third repeat; however  they differ in their overall composition. Our findings indicate that at least three distinct types of filaments exist: homogeneous 3R tau  homogeneous 4R tau  and heterogeneous 3R/4R tau.

Covid-19 has the potential to destroy individual livelihoods, businesses, industries and entire economies. The mining sector is not immune to these impacts, and the crisis has the potential to have severe consequences in the short, medium and long-term for the industry. Understanding these impacts, and analysing their significance for the industry, and the role it plays in wider economic development is a crucial task for academic research.

The proportion of typical medial-temporal amnesia revealing AD remains unknown. OBJECTIVE: The present study explores the episodic memory impairment profiles by the Free and Cued Selective Recall Reminding Test (FCSRT) in patients with initial memory complaint and a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker signature of AD. METHODS: Seventy-three patients referred for memory complaint to the Centers for Memory  Resource and Research of Lyon and Montpellier (France) were included consecutively. All patients underwent an extensive neuropsychological examination and had a Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score EEE20 and a positive CSF AD signature. The patients were classified as having mild dementia or prodromal AD. Verbal episodic memory was assessed using the French version of the FCSRT exploring encoding  storage/consolidation  and cued delayed retrieval phases of memorization. Three different memory profiles were identified according to the results of FCSRT. RESULTS: The median age was 72 year-old [interquartiles: 65-76].

9054,Plasma Exchange in the Treatment of Thrombotic Microangiopathy Associated with Covid-19 Infection: A Case Report,"SESSION TITLE: Medical Students/Residents' COVID-19 SESSION TYPE: Med Student/Res Case Report PRESENTED ON: October 18-21, 2020 INTRODUCTION: The novel Coronavirus-2019 pandemic brings a largely unfamiliar landscape and continual quest for understanding of the spectrum of presentation for this disease. Recent studies have shown endothelial injury as the trigger for the cytokine storm seen in Covid-19 infection. Hypercoagulability and excessive complement activation can lead to a diffuse thrombotic angiopathy and organ dysfunction CASE PRESENTATION: 40 year old Hispanic male with no past medical history presented to the emergency room with weakness, AMS, recurrent hematemesis. Upon arrival, he was immediately intubated for airway protection. On exam pertinent findings included fever of 102degreeF, response to noxious stimuli only, and scleral icterus. Laboratory data revealed creatinine 8.08 mg/dL, LDH >2500 IU/L, haptoglobin <10 mg/dL, bilirubin 1.2 mg/dL, hemoglobin 6.8 g/dL, platelets 7,000/L with presence of 3+ schistocytes and positive test for COVID-19. PCR was negative for STEC and shigella. Given a PLASMIC score of 7, a presumptive diagnosis of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) was made and daily plasma exchange (PEX) with dialysis was urgently initiated. A normal ADAMTS13 level led to discontinuation of PEX after 3 sessions; however, after 4 days hemolysis worsened with low C3 complement, therefore PEX was restarted. A complement panel was suggestive of alternative pathway dysregulation. Patient underwent 15 additional sessions of PEX with resolution of hemolysis, improved renal function and mental status. DISCUSSION: Endothelial injury results in exposure of collagen, vWF, fibrinogen. This serves as a trigger for the hypercoagulability and TMA. TMA encompasses a group of disorders characterized by MAHA, thrombocytopenia with varying degrees of end organ damage. One subtype is TTP usually relating to endothelial dysfunction with formation of microthrombi from large platelet-vWF subunits. Another entity is hemolytic uremic syndrome, which is characterized by excessive complement activation often caused by shigella-toxin. Neither of which were seen in this patient. We suspect this patient's presentation to be a manifestation of complement mediated TMA (CM-TMA) due to COVID. Previous review articles propose the possibility of viral infections including H1N1 causing dysregulation of complement cascade leading to TMA. Autoantibodies can form to complements that regulate complement cascade such as Factor H or Membrane Cofactor Protein. This can lead to dysregulation leading to C3 consumption, endothelial damage and formation of platelet microthrombi. His improvement with PEX poses a probable mechanism of removing cytokines, activated complements and antibodies. CONCLUSION(S): Complement mediated thrombotic microangiopathy could be the final pathway in critical illness. Our case shows that PEX may provide therapeutic benefit by normalization of the complement pathway while awaiting clearance of COVID viremia. Reference #1: Lopes R.

2312,"Lockdown of an Orthopedic Department during COVID-19 Epidemics, Our Experience in a General Hospital","The COVID-19 disease is rapidly spreading around the world, affecting many countries and their healthcare systems. Like many other countries, Iran is struggling with the current situation. In this article, we aim to share our perspectives on confronting obstacles mentioned above using appropriate hospital protocols during the COVID-19 crisis. We investigated and compared the number of referred patients to the emergency room, elective, and emergent orthopedic operations in our hospital, along with a number of residents and faculty participants in the morning reports and virtual classes before and after the outbreak of COVID-19 in our hospital. The number of referred patients to the emergency room was significantly reduced; the number of orthopedic operations was also decreased to almost zero in March 2020. Meanwhile, we managed to dismiss our residents and reduce the number of in-hospital morning reports and conferences.

Like many other countries, Iran is struggling with the current situation. In this article, we aim to share our perspectives on confronting obstacles mentioned above using appropriate hospital protocols during the COVID-19 crisis. We investigated and compared the number of referred patients to the emergency room, elective, and emergent orthopedic operations in our hospital, along with a number of residents and faculty participants in the morning reports and virtual classes before and after the outbreak of COVID-19 in our hospital. The number of referred patients to the emergency room was significantly reduced; the number of orthopedic operations was also decreased to almost zero in March 2020. Meanwhile, we managed to dismiss our residents and reduce the number of in-hospital morning reports and conferences.

57028,Lung Mechanics of Mechanically Ventilated Patients With COVID-19: Analytics With High-Granularity Ventilator Waveform Data,"Background: Lung mechanics during invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) for both prognostic and therapeutic implications; however, the full trajectory lung mechanics has never been described for novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients requiring IMV. The study aimed to describe the full trajectory of lung mechanics of mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients. The clinical and ventilator setting that can influence patient-ventilator asynchrony (PVA) and compliance were explored. Post-extubation spirometry test was performed to assess the pulmonary function after COVID-19 induced ARDS. Method(s): This was a retrospective study conducted in a tertiary care hospital. All patients with IMV due to COVID-19 induced ARDS were included. High-granularity ventilator waveforms were analyzed with deep learning algorithm to obtain PVAs. Asynchrony index (AI) was calculated as the number of asynchronous events divided by the number of ventilator cycles and wasted efforts. Mortality was recorded as the vital status on hospital discharge. Result(s): A total of 3,923,450 respiratory cycles in 2,778 h were analyzed (average: 24 cycles/min) for seven patients. Higher plateau pressure (Coefficient: -0.90; 95% CI: -1.02 to -0.78) and neuromuscular blockades (Coefficient: -6.54; 95% CI: -9.92 to -3.16) were associated with lower AI. Survivors showed increasing compliance over time, whereas non-survivors showed persistently low compliance. Recruitment maneuver was not able to improve lung compliance. Patients were on supine position in 1,422 h (51%), followed by prone positioning (499 h, 18%), left positioning (453 h, 16%), and right positioning (404 h, 15%). As compared with supine positioning, prone positioning was associated with 2.31 ml/cmH2O (95% CI: 1.75 to 2.86; p < 0.001) increase in lung compliance. Spirometry tests showed that pulmonary functions were reduced to one third of the predicted values after extubation. Conclusion(s): The study for the first time described full trajectory of lung mechanics of patients with COVID-19. The result showed that prone positioning was associated with improved compliance; higher plateau pressure and use of neuromuscular blockades were associated with lower risk of AI.ÁE© Copyright ÁE© 2020 Ge, Pan, Zhou, Xu, Zhang, Zhang, Yi, Yang, Zhou, Liu and Zhang.",0,"Lung Mechanics of Mechanically Ventilated Patients With COVID-19: Analytics With High-Granularity Ventilator Waveform DataBackground: Lung mechanics during invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) for both prognostic and therapeutic implications; however, the full trajectory lung mechanics has never been described for novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients requiring IMV.

Data for 210 countries and territories available in public domains were analyzed in relation to mandatory vaccination with Bacille-Calmette-Guerin (BCG), population density, median age of the country population, health care expenditure per capita, life expectancy at birth, healthy life expectancy, literacy rate, per capita gross domestic production adjusted to purchasing power (PPP), burden of tuberculosis (TB), acquired immunodeficiency disease caused by human immunodeficiency virus (HI V-AIDS), malaria, cardiovascular disease (CVD), neoplasm, diabetes, deaths due to energy-protein (food) deficiency (EPD), and per capita government spending on safe water and sanitation. Mandatory BCG vaccination showed a highly significant (p<0.0001) negative correlation with COVID-19 morbidity (r = -0.62) and mortality (r = -0.58) rates, but no significant correlation with CFR. The median age of the nation showed a significant (p<0.0001) positive correlation with COVID-19 morbidity (r= 0.40) and mortality (r = 0.34) rates, but no significant correlation with CFR.

Aberrant PIP2 metabolism has also been implicated in a variety of human disease states  e.g.  cancer and diabetes. Here we report that familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD)-associated presenilin mutations cause an imbalance in PIP2 metabolism. We find that the transient receptor potential melastatin 7 (TRPM7)-associated Mg2+ -inhibited cation (MIC) channel underlies ion channel dysfunction in presenilin FAD mutant cells  and the observed channel deficits are restored by the addition of PIP2  a known regulator of the MIC/TRPM7 channel. Lipid analyses show that PIP2 turnover is selectively affected in FAD mutant presenilin cells. We also find that modulation of cellular PIP2 closely correlates with 42-residue amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta42) levels. Our data suggest that PIP2 imbalance may contribute to Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis by affecting multiple cellular pathways  such as the generation of toxic Abeta42 as well as the activity of the MIC/TRPM7 channel  which has been linked to other neurodegenerative conditions.

20986,Reshaping ophthalmology training after COVID-19 pandemic,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had a significant impact on practical activities and didactic teaching of residents and fellows. This survey aimed to propose long-term changes for ophthalmology training based on the changes experienced by trainees and their perception of new training opportunities. METHODS: An online survey was distributed to ophthalmology trainees in multiple countries. Descriptive statistics were used to analyse the data. RESULTS: A total of 504 analyzable responses were collected from 32 different countries. The current impact of COVID-19 pandemic was described as ""severe"" by most trainees (55.2%); however, the future perspective was more optimistic as demonstrated by the greater number of responses reporting a presumed ""moderate"" (37.3%), ""mild"" (14.1%) or ""slight"" (4.2%) long-term impact. The vast majority of trainees reported a decrease >=50% of clinical activity (76.4%) and >75% of surgical activity (74.6%). Although an initial gap in didactic teaching has been experienced by many (55.4%), regular web-based teaching was reportedly attended by 67.7% of the respondents. A strong agreement was found regarding the worthwhile role of web-based case-presentations in clinical training (91.7%), web-based discussion of edited surgical videos (85.7%) and simulation-based practice (86.9%) in surgical training. CONCLUSIONS: This survey, focusing on trainees' perspective, strongly reinforces the need to promptly include new technology-based training tools, such as web-based teaching, virtual surgical simulators, and telementoring, in long-term reorganisation of ophthalmology training to ensure its continuity and effectiveness, which would remain available even in the face of another unpredictable crisis within the health system.",0,"Reshaping ophthalmology training after COVID-19 pandemicBACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had a significant impact on practical activities and didactic teaching of residents and fellows.

The vast majority of trainees reported a decrease >=50% of clinical activity (76.4%) and >75% of surgical activity (74.6%). Although an initial gap in didactic teaching has been experienced by many (55.4%), regular web-based teaching was reportedly attended by 67.7% of the respondents. A strong agreement was found regarding the worthwhile role of web-based case-presentations in clinical training (91.7%), web-based discussion of edited surgical videos (85.7%) and simulation-based practice (86.9%) in surgical training. CONCLUSIONS: This survey, focusing on trainees' perspective, strongly reinforces the need to promptly include new technology-based training tools, such as web-based teaching, virtual surgical simulators, and telementoring, in long-term reorganisation of ophthalmology training to ensure its continuity and effectiveness, which would remain available even in the face of another unpredictable crisis within the health system.","{'judgement': 'False', 'index': 117}",0,"{'judgement': 'False', 'index': 117}",0,"{'judgement': 'False', 'index': 117}",0,"{'judgement': 'False', 'index': 117}",0,"{'judgement': '', 'probability': '', 'index': 117}",

6678,Noninvasive diagnosis of small bowel Crohn's disease: combined use of bowel sonography and Tc-99m-HMPAO leukocyte scintigraphy,"BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease (CD) is frequently localized in the small bowel, with the diagnosis of disease and the assessment of its extension made by ileo-colonoscopy (IC) and small bowel enteroclysis (SBE). Transabdominal bowel sonography (BS) and Tc-99m-HMPAO leukocyte scintigraphy (LS) are increasingly used for the diagnosis of CD because of their minimal invasiveness, reproducibility, and acceptable costs. METHODS: From March 2000 to July 2003, we performed IC, SBE, BS, and LS in 84 patients with either suspected or known small bowel CD. RESULTS: Small bowel CD was present in 50 patients, whereas the other 34 patients received a different diagnosis. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and diagnostic accuracy were, respectively, 98%, 97%, 98%, 97%, and 0.97 for SBE; 92%, 97%, 98%, 88%, and 0.94 for BS; and 90%, 93%, 96%, 85%, and 0.92 for LS. In addition, the combined use of BS and LS led to overall sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and diagnostic accuracy of 100%, 93%, 96%, 100%, and 0.97, respectively. BS showed a fair concordance with SBE in terms of location (k = 0.71) and a correlation with the extension of the disease (r = 0.67, P < 0.001). LS showed a concordance with SBE with regard to location in about one-half the population (k = 0.54), whereas it was less effective than SBE in defining disease extension.

This study analyses the influence of the perceived threat of COVID-19 on subjective mental well-being with an online survey (n = 711). Findings confirmed the hypothesized model that provides a process explanation for this effect through the mediating influence of the activation of future anxiety. In addition, results confirmed that this influence via future anxiety is moderated by resilience, a personality trait that enables individuals to cope better with stressful or traumatic events. Individuals with higher levels of resilience compared to those with lower levels registered a lower impact of perceived Covid threat on future anxiety and, in turn, on subjective well-being. This study contributes theoretically to a better understanding of the factors that determine the impact of traumatic events such as a pandemic on people's mental health.

44684,Linear quantitation of Abeta aggregation using Thioflavin T: reduction in fibril formation by colostrinin.,Thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence is a commonly used method to monitor Abeta protein fibril formation. This method is particularly attractive since ThT fluoresces only when bound to fibrils  the reaction is completed within 1min and ThT does not interfere with aggregation of Abeta fibrils. One of the drawbacks of this method is the lack of a strict quantitative relationship between ThT fluorescence and fibril content. It was observed that  when the same gram molecular weight of Abeta (1-40) is dissolved into varying amounts of base then placed into a constant volume of aqueous buffer  a non-linear fluorescent response is obtained. By maintaining a strict relationship between Abeta content and the volume of base  this anomalous result can be alleviated and a linear dose response curve is obtained at much lower Abeta concentrations than is typically observed. In addition  differences in Abeta batch to batch preparations are alleviated. It was previously reported that colostrinin (CLN)  a proline-rich peptide derived from colostrum  reduces fibril content and protects neuroblastoma cells against Abeta peptide-induced toxicity. The newly developed ThT fluorescence protocol was used to quantify Abeta fibril content after treatment with CLN. We also demonstrate that CLN  can solubilize Abeta fibrils in a dose and time-dependent fashion.,0,Linear quantitation of Abeta aggregation using Thioflavin T: reduction in fibril formation by colostrinin.Thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence is a commonly used method to monitor Abeta protein fibril formation.

In the current study, we aimed to investigate the effect of this unexpected context on sleep. Method(s): During the COVID-19 outbreak, we performed an online survey with individuals formerly recruited for validation of the Spanish version of the sleep questionnaire Satisfaction, Alertness, Timing, Efficiency, and Duration (SATED). In the current survey, we asked the participants to complete the previously answered questionnaires including the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), a modified version of the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), and the SATED questionnaire. We also assessed the mood by the Profile of Mood States (POMS) questionnaire. Result(s): The 71 participants were mostly women (75%) with a mean (+/- SD) age of 40.7 +/- 11.9 years. Comparing the previous PSQI score to that during the COVID-19 outbreak, we observed worsening sleep quality (5.45 +/- 3.14 to 6.18 +/- 3.03 points, p = 0.035). In parallel, there was an increase in the negative mood (p = 0.002). Accordingly, the decrease in sleep quality was substantially correlated with negative mood (p < 0.001). There were no differences in the ESS or SATED. Conclusion(s): The COVID-19 outbreak-associated events correlate with decreased sleep quality in association with an increase in negative mood.

56119,Identification of MCI using optimal sparse MAR modeled effective connectivity networks.,Capability of detecting causal or effective connectivity from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (R-fMRI) is highly desirable for better understanding the cooperative nature of the brain. Effective connectivity provides specific dynamic temporal information of R-fMRI time series and reflects the directional causal influence of one brain region over another. These causal influences among brain regions are normally extracted based on the concept of Granger causality.

Effective connectivity provides specific dynamic temporal information of R-fMRI time series and reflects the directional causal influence of one brain region over another. These causal influences among brain regions are normally extracted based on the concept of Granger causality.

Free radical injury is an important effector of molecular and cellular stress in the aging brain that derives from multiple sources. OBJECTIVE: To identify potentially modifiable risk factors associated with increased markers of brain oxidative stress. DESIGN  SETTING  AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional  academic multicenter study consisted of 320 research volunteers (172 women) aged 21 to 100 years who were medically healthy and cognitively normal. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Free radical injury to the brain was assessed using cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) F2-isoprostane (F2-IsoP) concentrations correlated with age  sex  race  cigarette smoking  body mass index  inheritance of the ~}u4 allele of the apolipoprotein E gene (APOE)  and CSF biomarkers of Alzheimer disease. RESULTS: The concentration of CSF F2-IsoP increased with age by approximately 3 pg/mL (approximately 10%) from age 45 to 71 years in medically healthy  cognitively normal adults (P <jv.001). The CSF F2-IsoP concentration increased by approximately more than 10% for every 5-U increase in body mass index (P <jv.001). Current smoking had an approximately 3-fold greater effect on CSF F2-IsoPs compared with age (P <jv.001).

Here we discuss the application of a penalized multivariate model  sparse reduced-rank regression (sRRR)  for the genome-wide detection of markers associated with voxel-wise longitudinal changes in the brain caused by Alzheimer's disease (AD). Using a sample from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database  we performed three separate studies that each compared two groups of individuals to identify genes associated with disease development and progression. For each comparison we took a two-step approach: initially  using penalized linear discriminant analysis  we identified voxels that provide an imaging signature of the disease with high classification accuracy; then we used this multivariate biomarker as a phenotype in a genome-wide association study  carried out using sRRR. The genetic markers were ranked in order of importance of association to the phenotypes using a data re-sampling approach.

We undertook a web-based survey among parents of post-liver transplant pediatric patients to assess knowledge and concerns regarding COVID-19 pandemic and impact of social media on them. METHODS: This cross-sectional online survey was conducted between 21st to 26th March 2020. A 19-item questionnaire was sent to 172 parents of post-liver transplant children. RESULTS: 106 (62%) of parents responded. Median time since transplant was 31 (12-52) months. The majority of parents had good understanding regarding symptomatology and routes of transmission. Only 27% were aware of feco-oral transmission and 34% knew about gastrointestinal symptoms of COVID-19. 100 % of parents understood concept of social distancing and 70% knew that asymptomatic individuals can transmit the virus. Television followed by newspapers was the main source of their information, though over 40% claim to regularly receive information through social media. 87% would consult their doctor if the child had a flu-like symptoms rather than modify immunosuppression or try alternative medications. Parental concerns mainly revolved around early recognition of symptoms, querries on unconventional treatments circulating over social media and supply of medications during the lockdown period. CONCLUSIONS: The Majority of parents had basic understanding of COVID-19 pandemic. Social media appeared to be an important source of information.

11071,Mental Health During the COVID-19 Pandemic: An Online Survey with a US Sample,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic presented numerous worldwide effects. In the U.S., there have been 2.1 million cases and nearly 116,000 deaths as of June 17, 2020. Based on previous studies of mental health during outbreaks, the mental health of the population will be negatively affected in the aftermath. The long-term nature of this pandemic may lead to unforeseen mental health outcomes and/or unexpected relationships between demographic factors and mental health outcomes. OBJECTIVE: This research focused on assessing the mental health status of adults in the U.S. during the early weeks of an unfolding pandemic. METHODS: Data was collected from English-speaking adults using an online survey from early April to early June 2020. The final convenience sample included 1,083 U.S. residents. The 71-item survey consisted of demographic questions, mental health and wellbeing measures, a coping mechanisms checklist, and questions about COVID-19-specific concerns. Hierarchical multivariable logistic regression was utilized to explore associations among demographic variables and mental health outcomes. Hierarchical linear regression was conducted to examine associations among demographic variables, COVID-19-specific concerns, and mental health and wellbeing outcomes. RESULTS: Approximately 50% of the U.S. sample was aged 45 and older. Most of the sample was White (96%), Non-Hispanic (93%), and female (82%). Participants reported high rates of depression (29%), anxiety (34%), and stress (73%). Older individuals were less likely to report depressive symptomology (OR=0.78, P<0.001) and anxiety symptomology (OR=0.72, P<0.001); and they had lower stress scores (-.15 points, SE=.01, P<.001), and increased wellbeing scores (+1.86 points, SE=22, P<.001). Individuals who were no longer working due to COVID-19 were 2.25 times more likely to report symptoms of depression (P=.02), had a .51-point increase in stress (SE=.17, P=.015), and a 3.9-point decrease in wellbeing scores (SE=1.49, P=.009) compared to individuals who were working remotely before and after COVID. Individuals who have partial or no insurance coverage were 2-3 times more likely to report depressive symptomology compared to individuals with full coverage (P=.02; P=.01). Individuals who were on Medicare/Medicaid were 1.97 times more likely, and individuals with no coverage were 4.48 times more likely, to report moderate or severe anxiety (P=.03; P=.01). Financial and food access concerns were significantly and positively related to depression, anxiety, and stress (all P<.05), and significantly negatively related to wellbeing (both P<.001). Economy, illness, and death concerns were significantly positively related to overall stress scores (all P<.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that many US residents are experiencing high stress, depressive, and anxiety symptomatology, especially among those under/uninsured or unemployed. Longitudinal investigation of these variables is recommended. Health practitioners may provide opportunities to allay concerns or offer coping techniques to individuals in need of mental health care. These messages should be shared in person and through practice websites and social media.

11528,The overexpression of presenilin2 and Alzheimer's-disease-linked presenilin2 variants influences TRPC6-enhanced Ca2+ entry into HEK293 cells.,Mutations in the presenilin (PS) genes are linked to the development of early-onset Alzheimer's disease by a gain-of-function mechanism that alters proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). Recent work indicates that Alzheimer's-disease-linked mutations in presenilin1 and presenilin2 attenuate calcium entry and augment calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in different cell types. However  the regulatory mechanisms underlying the altered profile of Ca(2+) signaling are unknown. The present study investigated the influence of two familial Alzheimer's-disease-linked presenilin2 variants (N141I and M239V) and a loss-of-function presenilin2 mutant (D263A) on the activity of the transient receptor potential canonical (TRPC)6 Ca(2+) entry channel. We show that transient coexpression of Alzheimer's-disease-linked presenilin2 mutants and TRPC6 in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells abolished agonist-induced TRPC6 activation without affecting agonist-induced endogenous Ca(2+) entry. The inhibitory effect of presenilin2 and the Alzheimer's-disease-linked presenilin2 variants was not due to an increase in amyloid beta-peptides in the medium. Despite the strong negative effect of the presenilin2 and Alzheimer's-disease-linked presenilin2 variants on agonist-induced TRPC6 activation  conformational coupling between inositol 1 4 5-trisphosphate receptor type 3 (IP(3)R3) and TRPC6 was unaffected. In cells coexpressing presenilin2 or the FAD-linked presenilin2 variants  Ca(2+) entry through TRPC6 could still be induced by direct activation of TRPC6 with 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol (OAG). Furthermore  transient coexpression of a loss-of-function PS2 mutant and TRPC6 in HEK293T cells enhanced angiotensin II (AngII)- and OAG-induced Ca(2+) entry. These results clearly indicate that presenilin2 influences TRPC6-mediated Ca(2+) entry into HEK293 cells.,0,The overexpression of presenilin2 and Alzheimer's-disease-linked presenilin2 variants influences TRPC6-enhanced Ca2+ entry into HEK293 cells.Mutations in the presenilin (PS) genes are linked to the development of early-onset Alzheimer's disease by a gain-of-function mechanism that alters proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP).

58710,Physiologic portosystemic shunt resulting in hepatic encephalopathy in an elderly male.,"Purpose: We present the case of an 83-year-old male with a complicated recent medical course following coronary artery bypass graftand mitral valve replacement. Post-operatively  he developed respiratory failure requiring tracheostomy  acute renal failure progressing to end stage renal disease  and dysphagia requiring gastrostomy tube placement. He gradually improved and was transferred to an inpatient rehabilitation facility. He was noted to have intermittent episodes of acute delirium that correlated well with elevated serum ammonia levels. On physical exam  he did have evidence of asterixis  and ammonia levels as high as 137 were recorded. He had no known history of liver disease  and imaging including abdominal ultrasound and computed tomography did not demonstrate evidence of cirrhosis. The main portal vein appeared mildly attenuated but patent. However  abdominal CT angiography did reveal a large portosystemic shunt from the portal confluence extending into the right renal vein and inferior vena cava with more than 50% of portal venous blood flow shunted. This was presumed to be the cause for his ""spontaneous encephalopathy."" Consideration was given to occlusion of the shunt; however  due to concerns for inducing severe portal hypertension  medical therapy with lactulose and Rifaximin was instead initiated. His mental status returned to baseline on this regimen with no signs of encephalopathy. In review of the existing literature  physiologic portosystemic shunts have been reported in isolated cases. Cirrhosis or hepatic trauma can be precipitating events  but most cases are thought to be congenital or acquired due to aneurysmal rupture between the portal and systemic circulation. Some patients develop marked encephalopathy  especially in cases where the shunt ratio exceeds 60% of blood flow. Others with less dramatic shunting are predisposed to the development of encephalopathy at times of infection or metabolic stress. Shunt occlusion has been performed using vascular plugs or coil embolization with an intravascular approach. A case series by Zidi et al. found that encephalopathy resolved in six of the seven patients treated with embolization. Other studies have demonstrated a significant risk of portal hypertension with development of esophageal varices as a result of shunt occlusion.

Intravascular shunt occlusion is an option  but may result in a prohibitively high risk of inducing portal hypertension.",0,"Physiologic portosystemic shunt resulting in hepatic encephalopathy in an elderly male.Purpose: We present the case of an 83-year-old male with a complicated recent medical course following coronary artery bypass graftand mitral valve replacement. Post-operatively  he developed respiratory failure requiring tracheostomy  acute renal failure progressing to end stage renal disease  and dysphagia requiring gastrostomy tube placement. He gradually improved and was transferred to an inpatient rehabilitation facility. He was noted to have intermittent episodes of acute delirium that correlated well with elevated serum ammonia levels. On physical exam  he did have evidence of asterixis  and ammonia levels as high as 137 were recorded. He had no known history of liver disease  and imaging including abdominal ultrasound and computed tomography did not demonstrate evidence of cirrhosis. The main portal vein appeared mildly attenuated but patent. However  abdominal CT angiography did reveal a large portosystemic shunt from the portal confluence extending into the right renal vein and inferior vena cava with more than 50% of portal venous blood flow shunted. This was presumed to be the cause for his ""spontaneous encephalopathy."" Consideration was given to occlusion of the shunt; however  due to concerns for inducing severe portal hypertension  medical therapy with lactulose and Rifaximin was instead initiated. His mental status returned to baseline on this regimen with no signs of encephalopathy. In review of the existing literature  physiologic portosystemic shunts have been reported in isolated cases. Cirrhosis or hepatic trauma can be precipitating events  but most cases are thought to be congenital or acquired due to aneurysmal rupture between the portal and systemic circulation. Some patients develop marked encephalopathy  especially in cases where the shunt ratio exceeds 60% of blood flow. Others with less dramatic shunting are predisposed to the development of encephalopathy at times of infection or metabolic stress. Shunt occlusion has been performed using vascular plugs or coil embolization with an intravascular approach. A case series by Zidi et al. found that encephalopathy resolved in six of the seven patients treated with embolization. Other studies have demonstrated a significant risk of portal hypertension with development of esophageal varices as a result of shunt occlusion. In summary  physiologic portosystemic shunts in the absence of cirrhosis are a rare occurrence that may be congenital or acquired. Resulting encephalopathy can be significant and mimics the physiology that occurs leading to encephalopathy following TIPS. Intravascular shunt occlusion is an option  but may result in a prohibitively high risk of inducing portal hypertension.","{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 143}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 143}",1,"{'judgement': 'False', 'index': 143}",0,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 143}",1,"{'judgement': 'False', 'index': 143}",0
63897,Effects of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Infection on Pregnant Women and Their Infants,"CONTEXT.-: The pandemic of a novel coronavirus, termed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has created an unprecedented global health burden. OBJECTIVE.-: To investigate the effect of the SARS-CoV-2 infection on maternal, fetal, and neonatal morbidity and other poor obstetrical outcomes. DESIGN.-: All suspected cases of pregnant women with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) admitted into one center in Wuhan from January 20 to March 19, 2020, were included. Detailed clinical data of those pregnancies with COVID-19 were retrospectively collected and analyzed. RESULTS.-: Twenty-seven pregnant women (4 early pregnancies included) with laboratory or clinically confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and 24 neonates born to the 23 women in late pregnancy were analyzed. On admission, 46.2% (13 of 27) of the patients had symptoms, including fever (11 of 27), cough (9 of 27), and vomiting (1 of 27). Decreased total lymphocytes count was observed in 81.5% (22 of 27) of patients. Twenty-six patients showed typical viral pneumonia by chest computed tomography scan, whereas 1 patient confirmed with COVID-19 infection showed no abnormality on chest computed tomography. One mother developed severe pneumonia 3 days after her delivery. No maternal or perinatal death occurred. Moreover, 1 early preterm newborn born to a mother with the complication of premature rupture of fetal membranes, highly suspected to have SARS-CoV-2 infection, was SARS-CoV-2 negative after repeated real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction testing. Statistical differences were observed between the groups of women in early and late pregnancy with COVID-19 in the occurrence of lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia. CONCLUSIONS.-: No major complications were reported among the studied cohort, though 1 serious case and 1 perinatal infection were observed. Much effort should be made to reduce the pathogenic effect of COVID-19 infection in pregnancies.Copyright ÁE© 2020 College of American Pathologists.",0,"Effects of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Infection on Pregnant Women and Their InfantsCONTEXT.-: The pandemic of a novel coronavirus, termed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has created an unprecedented global health burden.

The following parametric methods were evaluated: receptor parametric mapping (basis function implementation of the simplified reference tissue model with and without fixed k'(2))  reference Logan  and several multi-linear reference tissue methods (again with and without fixed k'(2)). In addition  standardised uptake value ratios with cerebellum (SUV(r)) were evaluated. Simulations were used to assess the effects of variation in flow (R(1))  fractional blood volume (V(b)) and binding potential (BP(ND)) itself on precision and accuracy of parametric BP(ND). For clinical studies  most parametric methods showed comparable performance  with poorest results for SUV(r). Best performance was obtained for receptor parametric mapping (RPM2) and one of the multi-linear reference tissue models (MRTM2)  both with fixed k'(2): BP(ND) outcome was less affected by noise and the images showed better contrast than other tested methods.

51517,Predicting the conversion of mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease based on the volumetric measurements of the selected brain structures in magnetic resonance imaging.,INTRODUCTION: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is defined as abnormal cognitive state  but does not meet the criteria for the diagnosis of dementia. According to the new guidelines Alzheimer's disease (AD) involves not only dementia's phase but also predementia phase which is asymptomatic and pathological process in the brain is already present. For this reason it is very important to determine the suitability of markers which should be positive before onset of the first symptoms. One of these biomarkers is a structural magnetic resonance imaging with hippocampal volumetric assessment. The aim of this study was to investigate the usefulness of structural brain magnetic resonance imaging with volumetric assessment of the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex  posterior cingulate gyrus  parahippocampal gyrus  temporal gyri: superior  medial and inferior  to predict the conversion of MCI to AD. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Magnetic resonance imaging of brain was performed at the baseline visit in 101 patients diagnosed with MCI. Clinic follow-ups were scheduled after 6.12 and 24 months. RESULTS: Amongst 101 patients with MCI  17 (16.8%) converted into AD within two years of observation. All measured volumes were lower in converters than non-converters. Discriminant analysis was conducted and sensitivity for MCI conversion to AD was 64.7%  specificity 96.4%. 91% of patients were correctly classified (converter or non-converter). CONCLUSIONS: Volumetric measurements may help clinicians to predict MCI conversion to AD but due to low sensitivity it cannot be use separately. The study group requires further observation.,0,Predicting the conversion of mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease based on the volumetric measurements of the selected brain structures in magnetic resonance imaging.INTRODUCTION: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is defined as abnormal cognitive state  but does not meet the criteria for the diagnosis of dementia.

36008,SVM-based CAD system for early detection of the Alzheimer's disease using kernel PCA and LDA.,Single-photon emission tomography (SPECT) imaging has been widely used to guide clinicians in the early Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis challenge. However  AD detection still relies on subjective steps carried out by clinicians  which entail in some way subjectivity to the final diagnosis. In this work  kernel principal component analysis (PCA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) are applied on functional images as dimension reduction and feature extraction techniques  which are subsequently used to train a supervised support vector machine (SVM) classifier. The complete methodology provides a kernel-based computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system capable to distinguish AD from normal subjects with 92.31% accuracy rate for a SPECT database consisting of 91 patients. The proposed methodology outperforms voxels-as-features (VAF) that was considered as baseline approach  which yields 80.22% for the same SPECT database.,0,SVM-based CAD system for early detection of the Alzheimer's disease using kernel PCA and LDA.Single-photon emission tomography (SPECT) imaging has been widely used to guide clinicians in the early Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis challenge.

RESULTS: Exposure of the cells to wortmannin resulted in an obvious lipid peroxidation  reduction of cell viability  cell process retraction  and plasma vacuolation  but with no obvious cell apoptosis. We also found that preincubation of the cells with melatonin or vitamin E attenuated differentially wortmannin-induced oxidative stress as well as GSK-3 overactivation and tau hyperphosphorylation.

18746,Human cerebrospinal fluid apolipoprotein E isoforms are apparently inefficient at complexing with synthetic Alzheimer's amyloid-[beta] peptide (A[beta] 1-40 ) in vitro.,BACKGROUND: Variation at the apolipoprotein E locus on chromosome 19 plays a role in more cases of Alzheimer's disease than does any other identified genetic determinant. We have previously reported the isoform-specific interaction of native human apolipoprotein E (APOE  gene; apoE  protein) epsilon 3 with the amyloid-ss peptide  Ass(1-40)  the major component of the cerebral amyloid deposits that appear to cause Alzheimer's disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In order to investigate the apoE: A beta interaction further  a modified assay was developed based on co-immunoprecipitation of the complex using an anti-apoE antibody (anti-apoE IP assay). RESULTS: Application of this assay demonstrated that the interaction of Ass(1-40) and apoE can be distinguished into two types: sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) -resistant and SDS-releasable. The SDS-resistant interaction between epsilon;3 and Ass(1-40) is apparently maximal at an Ass(1-40) concentration of approximately 75 micro M  and an Ass(1-40) /epsilon 3 molar ratio of about 250:1. The major apoE-isoform-specific difference in interaction with Ass(1-40) is the ability of Ass(1-40) to form SDS- resistant complexes with epsilon 3 but not with epsilon 4. Using the anti-apoE co-IP assay  we found that human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) epsilon 3 can also form an SDS-resistant complex with Ass(1-40) but human CSF epsilon;4 cannot. However  when compared with apoE epsilon;3 collected from the conditioned medium of APOE epsilon 3-transfected cells  the competence of equal concentrations of CSF apoE epsilon 3 to form SDS-resistant complexes with Ass(1-40) is apparently diminished. A 1:1 mixture of CSF plus apoE epsilon 3-containing conditioned medium is associated with diminished Ass(1-40) /epsilon;3 complex formation to a greater extent than that observed when an identical volume of phosphate-buffered saline is added to apoE epsilon;3 medium. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest the presence in CSF of factors that interfere with the formation of complexes between synthetic Ass(1-40) and apoE epsilon 3.,0,Human cerebrospinal fluid apolipoprotein E isoforms are apparently inefficient at complexing with synthetic Alzheimer's amyloid-[beta] peptide (A[beta] 1-40 ) in vitro.BACKGROUND: Variation at the apolipoprotein E locus on chromosome 19 plays a role in more cases of Alzheimer's disease than does any other identified genetic determinant.

57409,Breast Cancer and COVID-19: The Effect of Fear on Patients' Decision-making Process,"BACKGROUND/AIM: Coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) pandemic outbreak is currently having a huge impact on medical resource allocation. Breast Cancer (BC) patients are concerned both with BC treatment and COVID-19. This study aimed to estimate the impact of anxiety among patients, caused by the spreading of COVID-19. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between the 16th of January and the 20th of March 2020, we retrospectively enrolled 160 patients. Eighty-two patients with a suspected breast lesion (SBL) were divided into two groups: PRE-COVID-19-SBL and POST-COVID-19-SBL. Seventy-eight BC patients were divided into PRE-COVID-19-BC and POST-COVID-19-BC. Patient characteristics including age, marital status, SBL/BC diameter, personal and family history of BC, clinical stage and molecular subtype were recorded. Procedure Refusal (PR) and Surgical Refusal (SR) were also recorded with their reason. RESULTS: BC and SBL analysis showed no difference in pre-treatment characteristics (p>0.05). Both POST-COVID-19-SBL and POST-COVID-19-BC groups showed higher rates of PR and SR (p=0.0208, p=0.0065 respectively). Infection risk represented primary reason for refusal among POST-COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSION: COVID-19-related anxiety could affect patients' decision-making process.

40381,Advanced glycation end products enhance amyloid precursor protein expression by inducing reactive oxygen species.,Accumulation of senile plaques comprising Abeta and neurofibrillary tangles is a major hallmark in the brain of AD patients. Ample evidence has shown that inflammation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) increase in the AD patient's brain. However  the pathogenesis of AD is unclear. Some risk factors of AD include age  sex  genetics  and chronic disease. Epidemiological studies have suggested that the levels of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) are enhanced in patients with diabetes mellitus and during the aging process. At the same time  evidence indicates a moderately increased risk of development of AD in diabetic patients. AGEs may play a role in the pathogenesis of AD. In this study  we proposed that amyloid precursor protein (APP) expression was regulated by AGEs. Our data showed that APP was up-regulated by AGEs in vitro and in vivo  and pretreatment of cells with an ROS inhibitor (N-acetyl-L-cysteine) blocked the effects of AGEs. In conditioned medium  the level of Abeta(1-42) increased after AGE treatment. Furthermore  the combination of AGEs and aggregated Abeta(1-42) increased ROS production and decreased cell viability. We suggest that AGEs participate in AD development and are an important risk factor in the pathogenesis of AD.,0,Advanced glycation end products enhance amyloid precursor protein expression by inducing reactive oxygen species.Accumulation of senile plaques comprising Abeta and neurofibrillary tangles is a major hallmark in the brain of AD patients.

The aim of this study was to analyze COVID-19-associated liver dysfunction (LD), its association with the risk of death and prognosis after discharge. Methods: Three-hundred and fifty-five COVID-19 patients were recruited. Clinical data were collected from electronic medical records. LD was evaluated and its prognosis was tracked. The association between LD and the risk of death was analyzed. Results: Of the 355 COVID-19 patients, 211 had mild disease, 88 had severe disease, and 51 had critically ill disease. On admission, 223 (62.8%) patients presented with hypoproteinemia, 151(42.5%) with cholestasis, and 101 (28.5%) with hepatocellular injury. As expected, LD was more common in critically ill patients. By multivariate logistic regression, male sex, older age and lymphopenia were three important independent risk factors predicting LD among COVID-19 patients. Risk of death analysis showed that the fatality rate was higher in patients with hypoproteinemia than in those without hypoproteinemia (relative risk=9.471, p<0.01). Moreover, the fatality rate was higher in patients with cholestasis than those without cholestasis (relative risk=2.182, p<0.05). Follow-up observation found that more than one hepatic functional index of two-third patients remained abnormal at 14 days after discharge. Conclusions: LD at early disease stage elevates the risk of death of COVID-19 patients. COVID-19-associated LD does not recover completely by 14 days after discharge.

53125,Effects of coligand variation on the in vivo characteristics of Tc-99m-labeled interleukin-8 in detection of infection,In our previous studies  interleukin-8 (IL-8) was labeled with (99m)Tc using hydrazinonicotinamide (HYNIC) as bifunctional coupling agent and tricine as coligand. This preparation showed excellent characteristics for imaging of infection in a rabbit model of soft-tissue infection. In the present study  the propylaldehyde hydrazone formulation of HYNIC was introduced to stabilize HYNIC-IL-8. (99m)Tc-HYNIC-IL-8 was prepared using 5 different coligand formulations. The effect of these coligand formulations on the in vitro characteristics and in vivo behavior of (99m)Tc-HYNIC-IL-8 was investigated. HYNIC-conjugated IL-8 was labeled with (99m)Tc in the presence of either (A) tricine  (B) ethylenediaminediacetic acid (EDDA)  (C) tricine and trisodium triphenylphosphinetrisulfonate (TPPTS)  (D) tricine and nicotinic acid (NIC)  or (E) tricine and isonicotinic acid (ISONIC). These preparations were characterized in vitro by RP-HPLC  determination of the octanol/water partition coefficient  stability studies  and receptor binding assays. The in vivo biodistribution of the radiolabel in rabbits with E. coli-induced soft-tissue infection was determined both by gamma-camera imaging as well as by tissue counting at 6 h pi. Specific activity (MBq/microg) was highest for (ISO)NIC (up to 80) > TPPTS (40) > tricine (15) > EDDA (7). RP-HPLC and octanol/water partition coefficients showed a shift toward higher lipophilicity for the TPPTS preparation. The leukocyte receptor binding fractions were around 40-55% for all preparations except for TPPTS  which showed predominantly nonspecific binding. All preparations were stabilized in serum  but the stability in PBS was highest for NIC and TPPTS > EDDA > ISONIC > tricine. The in vivo biodistribution showed highest abscess/muscle for NIC and ISONIC (>200) > EDDA and tricine (approximately 100) > TPPTS (<40). Gamma camera imaging rapidly visualized the abscess from 2 h pi onward for all formulations. The abscess/background (A/B) at 6 h pi for ISONIC was significantly higher (P < 0.05) than that of tricine and the A/B of TPPTS was significantly lower (P < 0.05). IL-8 can be rapidly and easily labeled with (99m)Tc using HYNIC as a chelator in combination with various coligands. The most optimal infection imaging characteristics were found for formulations using nicotinic acid/tricine as coligand system combining a high specific activity and high in vitro stability with high abscess/muscle ratios (>200) and high abscess/background ratios (>20). Protein doses to be administered were as low as 70 ng/kg bodyweight. At these low protein doses  side effects are not to be expected in the human system. This paves the way for infection imaging studies in patients.,0,Effects of coligand variation on the in vivo characteristics of Tc-99m-labeled interleukin-8 in detection of infectionIn our previous studies  interleukin-8 (IL-8) was labeled with (99m)Tc using hydrazinonicotinamide (HYNIC) as bifunctional coupling agent and tricine as coligand.

11568,Automated identification of dementia using FDG-PET imaging.,Parametric FDG-PET images offer the potential for automated identification of the different dementia syndromes. However  various existing image features and classifiers have their limitations in characterizing and differentiating the patterns of this disease. We reported a hybrid feature extraction  selection  and classification approach  namely  the GA-MKL algorithm  for separating patients with suspected Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia from normal controls. In this approach  we extracted three groups of features to describe the average level  spatial variation  and asymmetry of glucose metabolic rates in 116 cortical volumes. An optimal combination of features  that is  capable of classifying dementia cases was identified by a genetic algorithm- (GA-) based method. The condition of each FDG-PET study was predicted by applying the selected features to a multikernel learning (MKL) machine  in which the weighting parameter of each kernel function can be automatically estimated. We compared our approach to two state-of-the-art dementia identification algorithms on a set of 129 clinical cases and improved the performance in separating the dementia types  achieving accuracy of 94.62%. There is a very good agreement between the proposed automated technique and the diagnosis made by clinicians.,0,Automated identification of dementia using FDG-PET imaging.Parametric FDG-PET images offer the potential for automated identification of the different dementia syndromes.

During the pandemic, treatment delay is being recommended in a nonquantitative, nonobjective, and nonpersonalized manner, and this approach may be associated with suboptimal outcomes. Quantitative integration of cancer mortality estimates and data on the consequences of treatment delay is needed to aid treatment decisions and improve patient outcomes.  Objective  To obtain quantitative integration of cancer-specific and COVID-19blspecific mortality estimates that can be used to make optimal decisions for individual patients and optimize resource allocation.  Design, Setting, and Participants  In this decision analytical model, age-specific and stage-specific estimates of overall survival preblCOVID-19 were adjusted by the probability of COVID-19 (individualized by county, treatment-specific variables, hospital exposure frequency, and COVID-19 infectivity estimates), COVID-19 mortality (individualized by age-specific, comorbidity-specific, and treatment-specific variables), and delay of cancer treatment (impact and duration). These model estimates were integrated into a web application (OncCOVID) to calculate estimates of the cumulative overall survival and restricted mean survival time of patients who received immediate vs delayed cancer treatment.

12380,Impact of COVID-19 and associated lockdown on livestock and poultry sectors in India,"The COVID-19 pandemic and the associated lockdown for a long period have created a significant adverse impact on different sectors, including that of the agriculture and other allied sub-sectors in India and several other countries. The present review aimed to depict the impact of this pandemic and the lockdown on the livestock and poultry sectors in the country, which has been one of the fastest-growing sectors in recent years. Inadequacy of country-wide information has been a major bottleneck for having a thorough understanding of the impact of the prolonged lockdown on different sub-sectors of livestock and poultry. In the present case, an in-depth analysis of the subject has been made through the collation of available published materials and information collected through public contacts. The pandemic and the associated lockdown has not only caused enormous distress to the millions of poor and marginal farmers for saving their crops and/or livestock and thereby assuring their livelihoods but also impacted the overall poultry, dairy, and other livestock production systems and associated value chains, nutrition and health care, and labor availability. The paper highlights various dimensions of the impacts, namely, reduction in demand of different commodities, wastage of the produce due to the closure of transport and market chains, distress sale of the produce, and labor shortage and revival strategies taken by the government and associated enterprises. The present impact study although gives a picture about the overall present scenario, a systematic study through the collection of primary data from all over the country is suggested, which will provide a holistic view of the impact on each of the sub-sectors and the associated value chains.Copyright ÁE© Biswal, et al.

18331,Plasma levels of Abeta42 and Abeta40 in Alzheimer patients during treatment with the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor tacrine.,Deregulation of amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing with increased production of amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) is considered to be a key pathogenic event in Alzheimer's disease (AD). It has been suggested that stimulation of the muscarinic M(1) receptor subtype affects APP processing and leads to a change in Abeta concentration. To test the hypothesis that treatment with a cholinesterase inhibitor could change the levels of Abeta in plasma  we measured Abeta42 and Abeta40 plasma levels in AD subjects before tacrine treatment and at weeks 2 and 6 of treatment. Treatment with tacrine had no statistically significant effect on plasma Abeta42 and Abeta40 either at 2 weeks or at 6 weeks of administration compared to baseline levels. Plasma Abeta42 and Abeta40 levels showed large subject-to-subject variation but small variation within the same patient over the 3-sample interval. After 2 weeks of treatment with tacrine  there was a strong negative correlation between tacrine concentration and levels of Abeta42 (r = -0.64; p = 0.01) and Abeta40 (r = -0.55; p = 0.04). However  after 6 weeks there was no correlation between plasma concentrations of tacrine and Abeta42 (r = 0.33; p = 0.34) or Abeta40 (r = -0.22; p = 0.54) levels in plasma. After 2 weeks of treatment with an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor  we found a correlation between higher drug concentrations and lower beta-amyloid levels. This might indicate an effect on APP metabolism with an increased alpha-cleavage. But after 6 weeks of drug treatment  there was no obvious drug effect on beta-amyloid concentrations. This finding may indicate that compensatory mechanisms have started at 6 weeks and that no long-term effect on key pathological features in AD is to be expected by an inhibition of acetylcholinesterase.,0,Plasma levels of Abeta42 and Abeta40 in Alzheimer patients during treatment with the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor tacrine.Deregulation of amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing with increased production of amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) is considered to be a key pathogenic event in Alzheimer's disease (AD).

METHODS AND RESULTS: Data from King's College Hospital, London, reported to the National Heart Failure Audit for England and Wales, between 2nd March - 19th April 2020 were compared both to a pre-COVID cohort and the corresponding time periods in 2017-2019 with respect to absolute hospitalization rates. Furthermore, we performed detailed comparison of patients hospitalized during the COVID-19 pandemic and patients presenting in the same period in 2019 with respect to clinical characteristics and management during the index admission. A significantly lower admission rate for AHF was observed during the study period compared to all other included time periods. Patients admitted during the COVID-19 pandemic had higher rates of NYHA III or IV symptoms (96% vs. 77%, p=0.03) and severe peripheral oedema (39% vs. 14%, p=0.01). We did not observe any differences in inpatient management, including place of care and pharmacological management of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) CONCLUSION: Incident AHF hospitalization significantly declined in our centre during the COVID-19 pandemic, but hospitalized patients had more severe symptoms at admission. Further studies are needed to investigate whether the incidence of AHF declined or patients did not present to hospital while the national lockdown and social distancing restrictions were in place.

41885,The use of renin angiotensin system inhibitor on mortality in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background: and Aims; To investigate the association between use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI)/angiotensin-receptor blocker (ARB) and outcomes of hypertensive COVID-19 patients, a systematic review and meta-analysis were performed. Method(s): We systematically searched PubMed, EuropePMC, ProQuest, and Cochrane Central Databases using the terms ""(COVID-19 OR SARS-CoV-2) AND (angiotensin converting enzyme OR angiotensin receptor blocker)"". The primary and second outcomes were mortality (non-survivor) and severe COVID-19, respectively. Result(s): Totally, 7410 patients were included from 15 studies. Pooled analysis showed that the use of ACEI/ARB was not associated with mortality (OR 0.73 [0.38, 1.40], p = 0.34; I2: 81%) and severity (OR 1.03 [0.73, 1.45], p = 0.87; I2: 65%). Pooled adjusted OR showed no risk/benefit associated with ACEI/ARB use in terms of mortality (OR 0.83 [0.54, 1.27], p = 0.38; I2: 0%). Subgroup analysis showed that the use of ARB was associated with reduced mortality (OR 0.51 [0.29, 0.90], p = 0.02; I2: 22%) but not ACEI subgroup (OR 0.68 [0.39, 1.17], p = 0.16; I2: 0%). Meta-regression showed that the association between ACEI/ARB use and mortality in patients with COVID-19 do not varies by gender (p = 0.104).

Method(s): We systematically searched PubMed, EuropePMC, ProQuest, and Cochrane Central Databases using the terms ""(COVID-19 OR SARS-CoV-2) AND (angiotensin converting enzyme OR angiotensin receptor blocker)"". The primary and second outcomes were mortality (non-survivor) and severe COVID-19, respectively. Result(s): Totally, 7410 patients were included from 15 studies. Pooled analysis showed that the use of ACEI/ARB was not associated with mortality (OR 0.73 [0.38, 1.40], p = 0.34; I2: 81%) and severity (OR 1.03 [0.73, 1.45], p = 0.87; I2: 65%). Pooled adjusted OR showed no risk/benefit associated with ACEI/ARB use in terms of mortality (OR 0.83 [0.54, 1.27], p = 0.38; I2: 0%). Subgroup analysis showed that the use of ARB was associated with reduced mortality (OR 0.51 [0.29, 0.90], p = 0.02; I2: 22%) but not ACEI subgroup (OR 0.68 [0.39, 1.17], p = 0.16; I2: 0%). Meta-regression showed that the association between ACEI/ARB use and mortality in patients with COVID-19 do not varies by gender (p = 0.104).

50704,Comparison of the severity of psychological distress among four groups of an Iranian population regarding COVID-19 pandemic,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused serious psychological problems, including panic attack, anxiety, stress, and depression. The main objective of this study was to measure the prevalence and compare the severity of this psychological distress among four groups of an Iranian population. METHOD: In a cross-sectional survey, the mental health status of four groups of an Iranian society including community population, patients with COVID-19, medical staff, and medical students were investigated by the self-report questionnaire of Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS). DASS-21 questionnaire and the demographic data sheet were filled out by the participants. All statistical analyses were done using R version 3.6.1 software. P-values less than 0.05 were considered as statistically significant. ANOVA test was used to compare the severity of stress, anxiety, and depression between the four study groups. RESULTS: Of the 886 participants in this survey, 554 (62.5%) were men and 332 (37.5%) were women, and the mean +/- standard division of age was 40.91 +/- 10.7 years. Among these participants, 241 (27.2%) were selected from community population, 221 (24.9%) were patients with COVID-19, 217 (24.5%) were medical staff, and 207 (23.4%) were medical students. The mean score of stress, anxiety, and depression in medical students and patients with COVID-19 was significantly higher than in medical staff and community population (P < 0.05). Overall, the anxiety score in men was higher than that in women (27.4 +/- 4.6 vs. 26.48 +/- 4.8, P = 0.006), and unmarried participants had a significantly higher depression score compared with the married group (27.5 +/- 4.8 vs. 26.7 +/- 4.6, P = 0.023).

54296,Altered lipid composition in cortical lipid rafts occurs at early stages of sporadic Alzheimer's disease and facilitates APP/BACE1 interactions.,The presence of lipid alterations in lipid rafts from the frontal cortex in late stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been recently demonstrated. Here  we have isolated and analyzed the lipid composition of lipid rafts from different brain areas from control and AD subjects at initial neuropathologic stages. We have observed that frontal cortex lipid rafts are profoundly altered in AD brains from the earliest stages of AD  namely AD I/II. These changes in the lipid matrix of lipid rafts affected both lipid classes and fatty acids and were also detected in the entorhinal cortex  but not in the cerebellum from the same subjects. Paralleling these changes  lipid rafts from AD frontal and entorhinal cortices displayed higher anisotropy for environment-sensitive probes  indicating that lipid changes in AD lipid rafts increased membrane order and viscosity in these domains. The pathophysiological consequences of these alterations in the development and progression of AD were strengthened by the significant  and specific  accumulation of EEE-secretase within the lipid rafts of AD subjects even at the earliest stages. Our results provide a mechanistic connection between lipid alterations in these microdomains and amyloidogenic processing of amyloid precursor protein.,0,Altered lipid composition in cortical lipid rafts occurs at early stages of sporadic Alzheimer's disease and facilitates APP/BACE1 interactions.The presence of lipid alterations in lipid rafts from the frontal cortex in late stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been recently demonstrated.

19330,Genome-wide genotyping demonstrates a polygenic risk score associated with white matter hyperintensity volume in CADASIL.,BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: White matter hyperintensities (WMH) on MRI are a quantitative marker for sporadic cerebral small vessel disease and are highly heritable. To date  large-scale genetic studies have identified only a single locus influencing WMH burden. This might in part relate to biological heterogeneity of sporadic WMH. The current study searched for genetic modifiers of WMH volume in cerebral autosomal-dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL)  a monogenic small vessel disease. METHODS: We performed a genome-wide association study to identify quantitative trait loci for WMH volume by combining data from 517 CADASIL patients collected through 7 centers across Europe. WMH volumes were centrally analyzed and quantified on fluid attenuated inversion recovery images. Genotyping was performed using the Affymetrix 6.0 platform. Individuals were assigned to 2 distinct genetic clusters (cluster 1 and cluster 2) based on their genetic background. RESULTS: Four hundred sixty-six patients entered the final genome-wide association study analysis. The phenotypic variance of WMH burden in CADASIL explained by all single nucleotide polymorphisms in cluster 1 was 0.85 (SE=0.21)  suggesting a substantial genetic contribution. Using cluster 1 as derivation and cluster 2 as a validation sample  a polygenic score was significantly associated with WMH burden (P=0.001) after correction for age  sex  and vascular risk factors. No single nucleotide polymorphism reached genome-wide significance. CONCLUSIONS: We found a polygenic score to be associated with WMH volume in CADASIL subjects. Our findings suggest that multiple variants with small effects influence WMH burden in CADASIL. The identification of these variants and the biological pathways involved will provide insights into the pathophysiology of white matter disease in CADASIL and possibly small vessel disease in general.,0,Genome-wide genotyping demonstrates a polygenic risk score associated with white matter hyperintensity volume in CADASIL.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: White matter hyperintensities (WMH) on MRI are a quantitative marker for sporadic cerebral small vessel disease and are highly heritable.

7870,Quantitative computed tomography analysis for stratifying the severity of Coronavirus Disease 2019,"Purpose: To examine the feasibility of using a computer tool for stratifying the severity of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) based on computed tomography (CT) images. Material(s) and Method(s): We retrospectively examined 44 confirmed COVID-19 cases. All cases were evaluated separately by radiologists (visually) and through an in-house computer software. The degree of lesions was visually scored by the radiologist, as follows, for each of the 5 lung lobes: 0, no lesion present; 1, <1/3 involvement; 2, >1/3 and < 2/3 involvement; and 3, >2/3 involvement. Lesion density was assessed based on the proportion of ground-glass opacity (GGO), consolidation and fibrosis of the lesions. The parameters obtained using the computer tool included lung volume (mL), lesion volume (mL), lesion percentage (%), and mean lesion density (HU) of the whole lung, right lung, left lung, and each lobe. The scores obtained by the radiologists and quantitative results generated by the computer software were tested for correlation. A Chi-square test was used to test the consistency of radiologist- and computer-derived lesion percentage in the right/left lung, upper/lower lobe, and each of the 5 lobes. Result(s): The results showed a strong to moderate correlation between lesion percentage scores obtained by radiologists and the computer software (r ranged from 0.7679 to 0.8373, P < 0.05), and a moderate correlation between the proportion of GGO and mean lesion density (r = -0.5894, P < 0.05), and proportion of consolidation and mean lesion density (r = 0.6282, P < 0.05). Computer-aided quantification showed a statistical significant higher lesion percentage for lower lobes than that assessed by the radiologists (chi2 = 8.160, P = 0.004).

64053,Epidemiological features and viral shedding in children with SARS-CoV-2 infection,"BACKGROUND: A pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 infection broke out all over the world, however, epidemiological data and viral shedding in pediatric patients are limited. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, multi-center study, and followed up with all children from the families with SARS-CoV-2 infected members in Zhejiang Province, China. All infections were confirmed by testing the SARS-CoV-2 RNA with RT-PCR method, and epidemiological data between children and adults in the same families was compared. Effect of antiviral therapy was evaluated observationally and fecal viral excretion times among groups with different antiviral regiments were compared with Kaplan Meier plot. RESULTS: By February 29, 2020, 1298 cases from 883 families were confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 infection and 314 of which were families with children. Incidence of infection in child close contacts was significantly lower than that in adult contacts (13.2% vs 21.2%). The mean age of 43 pediatric cases was 8.2 years and mean incubation period was 9.1 days. Forty (93.0%) were family clustering. Thirty-three children had COVID-19 (20 pneumonia) with mild symptoms and 10 were asymptomatic. Fecal SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection was positive in 91.4% (32/35) cases and some children had viral excretion time over 70 days. Viral clearance time was not different among the groups treated with different antiviral regiments. No subsequent infection was observed in family contacts of fecal-viral-excreting children. CONCLUSION: Children have lower susceptibility of SARS-CoV-2 infection, longer incubation and fecal viral excretion time.

The host response to coronavirus disease 2019 has only been partially elucidated, and prognostic biomarkers have not been identified. We performed targeted proteomics on critically ill coronavirus disease 2019 patients to better understand their pathophysiologic mediators and to identify potential outcome markers. Design: Blood was collected at predetermined ICU days for proximity extension assays to determine the plasma concentrations of 1,161 proteins. Setting: Tertiary care ICU and academic laboratory. Subjects: All patients admitted to the ICU suspected of being infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, using standardized hospital screening methodologies, had blood samples collected until either testing was confirmed negative on ICU day 3 (coronavirus disease 2019 negative) or until ICU day 10 if the patient positive (coronavirus disease 2019 positive). Interventions: None. Measurements and Main Results: Age- and sex-matched healthy control subjects and ICU patients who were either coronavirus disease 2019 positive or coronavirus disease 2019 negative were enrolled. Cohorts were well-balanced with the exception that coronavirus disease 2019 positive patients suffered bilateral pneumonia more frequently than coronavirus disease 2019 negative patients.

21450,Preliminary prediction of the basic reproduction number of the Wuhan novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV,"OBJECTIVES: To estimate the basic reproduction number of the Wuhan novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). METHODS: Based on the susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) compartment model and the assumption that the infectious cases with symptoms occurred before 26 January, 2020 are resulted from free propagation without intervention, we estimate the basic reproduction number of 2019-nCoV according to the reported confirmed cases and suspected cases, as well as the theoretical estimated number of infected cases by other research teams, together with some epidemiological determinants learned from the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). RESULTS: The basic reproduction number fall between 2.8 and 3.3 by using the real-time reports on the number of 2019-nCoV-infected cases from People's Daily in China and fall between 3.2 and 3.9 on the basis of the predicted number of infected cases from international colleagues.

66503,Mechanisms to explain the reverse perivascular transport of solutes out of the brain.,Experimental studies and observations in the human brain indicate that interstitial fluid and solutes  such as amyloid-beta (Abeta)  are eliminated from grey matter of the brain along pericapillary and periarterial pathways. It is unclear  however  what constitutes the motive force for such transport within blood vessel walls  which is in the opposite direction to blood flow. In this paper the potential for global pressure differences to achieve such transport are considered. A mathematical model is constructed in order to test the hypothesis that perivascular drainage of interstitial fluid and solutes out of brain tissue is driven by pulsations of the blood vessel walls. Here it is assumed that drainage occurs through a thin layer between astrocytes and endothelial cells or between smooth muscle cells. The model suggests that  during each pulse cycle  there are periods when fluid and solutes are driven along perivascular spaces in the reverse direction to the flow of blood. It is shown that successful drainage may depend upon some attachment of solutes to the lining of the perivascular space  in order to produce a valve-like effect  although an alternative without this requirement is also postulated. Reduction in pulse amplitude  as in ageing cerebral vessels  would prolong the attachment time  encourage precipitation of Abeta peptides in vessel walls  and impair elimination of Abeta from the brain. These factors may play a role in the pathogenesis of cerebral amyloid angiopathy and in the accumulation of Abeta in the brain in Alzheimer's disease.,0,Mechanisms to explain the reverse perivascular transport of solutes out of the brain.Experimental studies and observations in the human brain indicate that interstitial fluid and solutes  such as amyloid-beta (Abeta)  are eliminated from grey matter of the brain along pericapillary and periarterial pathways.

11916,Pathology Trainee Redeployment and Education During the COVID-19 Pandemic: An Institutional Experience,"Pathology training programs throughout the United States have endured unprecedented challenges dealing with the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. At Houston Methodist Hospital, the Department of Pathology and Genomic Medicine planned and executed a trainee-oriented, stepwise emergency response. The focus was on optimizing workflows among areas of both clinical and anatomic pathology, maintaining an excellent educational experience, and minimizing trainee exposure to coronavirus disease 2019. During the first phase of the response, trainees were divided into 2 groups: one working on-site and the other working remotely. With the progression of the pandemic, all trainees were called back on-site and further redeployed within our department to meet the significantly increased workload demands of our clinical laboratory services. Adjustments to trainee educational activities included, among others, the organization of a daily coronavirus disease 2019 virtual seminar series. This series served to facilitate communication between faculty, laboratory managers, and trainees. Moreover, it became a forum for trainees to provide updates on individual service workflows and volumes, ongoing projects and research, as well as literature reviews on coronavirus disease 2019-related topics. From our program's experience, redeploying pathology trainees within our department during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic resulted in optimization of patient care while ensuring trainee safety, and importantly, helped to maintain continuous high-quality education through active involvement in unique learning opportunities.

51313,Increased Use of Blood Transfusions to Manage Urological Conditions during the COVID-19 Pandemic,"INTRODUCTION: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) led to an extensive reorganization of the healthcare system in Italy, with significant deferment of the treatment of urology patients. We aimed to assess the impact of deferred treatment during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on the need for blood transfusions in 3 Italian urology departments. METHODS: We reviewed hospital chart data on blood transfusions at the urology units of 3 academic centers in the north of Italy from March to April 2020. Data were compared with values from the same time frame in 2019 (March to April 2019). RESULTS: We observed significant reductions of the number of patients admitted to the urology units from March to April 2020 (373 vs. 119) and the number of performed surgeries (242 vs. 938) compared to 2019. Though, the number of transfused blood units was comparable between the 2 years (182 vs. 252), we found a greater mean number of blood units transfused per admission in 2020 (0.49 vs. 0.22; p < 0.0001). As a whole, the transfusion rate for hematuria was higher in 2020 than in 2019 (36 vs. 7.9%; p < 0.0001). DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: The observed increased number of blood transfusions needed throughout the SARS-CoV-2 era could have had a negative impact on both patients and the healthcare system. It is possible to speculate that this is the consequence of a delayed diagnosis and deferred treatment of acute conditions. Copyright ÁE© 2020 S.

[Chinese],"Objective: To screen the material basis of Huopu Xialing Decoction in the treatment of damp pathogen stagnation of lung syndrome of early COVID-19 and predict its mechanism. Method(s): Literatures and clinical reports were reviewed to analyze the relationship between Huopu Xialing Decoction and damp pathogen stagnation of lung syndrome of early stage of COVID-19. TCMSP database was used to screen the potential active components in Huopo Xialing Decoction. Molecular docking of the active components with SARS-CoV-2 hydrolase and ACE2 was also carried out. According to the binding ability, the core components with both were screened. The interaction network of key components target proteins was constructed by using the software of Cytoscape to screen the main targets; The GO analysis of the main targets was carried out by using the STRING database, and the Pathway and KEGG enrichment analysis was carried out by using the plug-in of the software ClueGO of Cytoscape. Result(s): The Huopo Xialing Decoction was used to treat the early coronavirus pneumonia with damp pathogen and lung depression syndrome in the relationship analysis between prescriptions and syndrome, and the potential components of the 12 ingredients in Huopo Xialing Decoction were selected, with 67 core targets. Among them, paryriogenin I from Tetrapanax papyrifer, ergosterol peroxide from Poria cocos and Polyporus umbellatus, baicalin from Pinellia ternata had good binding activity with SARS-CoV-2 3CL hydrolase and ACE2. The results of enrichment analysis of GO, Pathway and KEGG showed that 12 potential components in Huopo Xialing Decoction were involved in regulating the biological processes such as stimulation response, signal transduction, cell death and the related signaling pathways including interleukins, EGFR in cancer, tyrosine kinases, programmed cell death and MAPK signaling pathways.

60995,Trehalose protects from aggravation of amyloid pathology induced by isoflurane anesthesia in APP(swe) mutant mice.,There is an open controversy about the role of surgery and anesthesia in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Clinical studies have shown a high prevalence of these procedures in subjects with AD but the interpretation of these studies is difficult because of the co-existence of multiple variables. Experimental studies in vitro and in vivo have shown that small molecular weight volatile anesthetics enhance amyloidogenesis in vitro and produce behavioral deficits and brain lesions similar to those found in patients with AD. We examined the effect of co-treatment with trehalose on isoflurane-induced amyloidogenesis in mice. WT and APP(swe) mice  of 11 months of age  were exposed to 1% isoflurane  3 times  for 1.5 hours each time and sacrificed 24 hours after their last exposure to isoflurane. The right hemi-brain was used for histological analysis and the contra-lateral hemi-brain used for biochemical studies. In this study  we have shown that repetitive exposure to isoflurane in pre-symptomatic mature APP(swe) mice increases apoptosis in hippocampus and cerebral cortex  enhances astrogliosis and the expression of GFAP and that these effects are prevented by co-treatment with trehalose  a disaccharide with known effects as enhancer of autophagy. We have also confirmed that in our model the co-treatment with trehalose increases the expression of autophagic markers as well as the expression of chaperones. Cotreatment with trehalose reduces the levels of EEE amyloid peptide aggregates  tau plaques and levels of phospho-tau. Our study  therefore  provides new therapeutic avenues that could help to prevent the putative pro-amyloidogenic properties of small volatile anesthetics.,0,Trehalose protects from aggravation of amyloid pathology induced by isoflurane anesthesia in APP(swe) mutant mice.There is an open controversy about the role of surgery and anesthesia in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Clinical studies have shown a high prevalence of these procedures in subjects with AD but the interpretation of these studies is difficult because of the co-existence of multiple variables.

46294,Alzheimer CSF biomarkers may be misleading in normal-pressure hydrocephalus.,OBJECTIVE: This article discusses why CSF biomarkers found in normal-pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) can be misleading when distinguishing NPH from comorbid NPH with Alzheimer disease (AD). METHODS: We describe NPH CSF biomarkers and how shunt surgery can change them. We hypothesize the effects that hydrocephalus may play on interstitial fluid space and amyloid precursor protein (APP) fragment drainage into the CSF based on a recent report and how this may explain the misleading CSF NPH biomarker findings. RESULTS: In NPH  EEE-amyloid protein 42 (AEEE42) is low (as in AD)  but total tau (t-tau) and phospho-tau (p-tau) levels are normal  providing conflicting biomarker findings. Low AEEE42 supports an AD diagnosis but tau findings do not. Importantly  not only AEEE42  but all APP fragments and tau proteins are low in NPH CSF. Further  these proteins increase after shunting. An increase in interstitial space and APP fragment drainage into the CSF during sleep was reported recently.

17969,Collateral damage - Impact of a pandemic on stroke emergency services,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic's impact on stroke care is two-fold [sbnd] direct impact of the infection and indirect impact on non-COVID-19 diseases. Anecdotal evidence and clinical observation suggest that there is a decrease in the number of patients presenting with stroke during the pandemic. We aim to understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the utilization of stroke emergency services on a single comprehensive stroke center (CSC). Method(s): We performed a retrospective analysis of a prospectively maintained database and compared all emergency department (ED) encounters, acute stroke admissions (including TIA), and thrombectomy cases admitted in March 2017-2019 to patients admitted in March 2020 at a comprehensive stroke center. Result(s): Number of total ED encounters (22%, p=0.005), acute ischemic strokes (40%, p=0.001), and TIAs (60%, p=0.163) decreased between March of 2017-2019 compared to March of 2020. The number of patients undergoing EVT in March 2020 was comparable to March 2017-2019 (p=0.430). Conclusion(s): A pandemic-related stay-at-home policy reduces the utilization of stroke emergency services at a CSC. This effect appears to be more prominent for ED encounters, all stroke admissions and TIAs, and less impactful for severe strokes. Given the relatively low prevalence of COVID-19 cases in our region, this decrement is likely related to healthcare seeking behavior rather than capacity saturation.Copyright ÁE© 2020 Elsevier Inc.",0,"Collateral damage - Impact of a pandemic on stroke emergency servicesBackground: The COVID-19 pandemic's impact on stroke care is two-fold [sbnd] direct impact of the infection and indirect impact on non-COVID-19 diseases.

METHODS: A total of 66 retired Al potroom workers and 70 unexposed controls were investigated. The cognitive functions were assessed with the Mini-Mental State Examination. The tau-protein expression in peripheral blood lymphocyte was analyzed with Western blot. RESULTS: The cognitive functions of the exposed group were significantly decreased. Twelve mild cognitive impairment cases in the exposed group and four mild cognitive impairment cases in the control group were diagnosed. Significantly higher p-tau181 and p-tau231 levels were detected in the Al-exposed workers than in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: The study suggests that long-term exposure to Al may cause cognitive disorders and that p-tau181 and p-tau231 might be useful indicators for monitoring cognitive decline in Al-exposed workers.,0,Cognitive disorders and tau-protein expression among retired aluminum smelting workers.OBJECTIVES: To analyze cognitive functions and tau-protein expression in peripheral blood lymphocytes of retired aluminum (Al)-exposed workers.

We have developed a doxycycline-inducible adenoviral-based system that directs intracellular Abeta42 expression and accumulation into the endoplasmic reticulum of primary neuronal cultures in a regulated manner. Abeta42 exhibited a perinuclear distribution in cell bodies and an association with vesicular compartments. Virally expressed intracellular Abeta42 was toxic to neuronal cultures 24 hr after induction in a dose-dependent manner. Abeta42 expression prompted the rapid induction of stress-inducible Hsp70 protein in neurons  and virally mediated Hsp70 overexpression rescued neurons from the toxic effects of intracellular Abeta accumulation.

55959,Perspectives of patients with rheumatic diseases in the early phase of COVID-19,"OBJECTIVE: To determine health perceptions of patients with rheumatic diseases in the early phase of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. METHODS: Rheumatology patients at a single centre received via text message the national Rheumatology Association COVID-19 information sheet and an invitation to participate in a de-identified survey. Patient concerns regarding risks conferred by their rheumatological disease or medications, impact of receiving the information sheet on the likelihood of staying on medication, and acceptance of telehealth, were ascertained. RESULTS: 2,630 patients received the message and the survey response rate was 21% (n=550). Mean (+/-SD) age was 52 (+/-15.2) years and 75% were female. Participants ' highest ranked concern was that their medications would increase their severity of COVID-19 (76.1%). The highest levels of concern were seen in patients on combination conventional synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (csDMARDs) and/or a biologic/targeted synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (b/tsDMARD). There was no association between prednisolone dose and concern. While 63% of patients planned to continue their anti-rheumatic medications, a further 30% were more likely to stay on their medications as a result of receiving the information. Telehealth was acceptable to 98.4% of patients, but 28.1% felt this was only appropriate while infection control measures were in place. CONCLUSION: Concerns regarding the risk of COVID-19 among patients on anti-rheumatic drugs are common. Proactive dissemination of information is needed to address misconceptions relating to medication risk, improve medication adherence and minimise the risk of flares.

19256,Mechanisms involved in prostaglandin E2-mediated neuroprotection against TNF-alpha: possible involvement of multiple signal transduction and beta-catenin/T-cell factor.,Cerebrospinal fluid prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) levels are elevated in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD)  which suggests that they are involved in neurodegeneration. We previously reported that TNF-alpha derived from human macrophages  in response to beta-amyloid or amyloidogenic C-terminal peptide  is a main mediator of inflammatory neurotoxicity. In a continuation of this work  the present study investigated the direct effect of PGE2  one of the major prostaglandins produced in the brain  on cell viability in SH-SY5Y neuronal cells treated with TNF-alpha. PGE2 did not promote neurotoxicity  but rather had a strong protective effect against TNF-alpha by ameliorating TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis and also by rescuing the intracellular level of beta-catenin  a key transducer of the Wnt signaling pathway. PGE2-mediated stabilization of beta-catenin was accompanied by T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor (Tcf/Lef)-mediated transcriptional activation  which was followed by an increase in the cyclinD1 level. Pharmacological studies provided further evidence supporting the notion that PGE2-mediated neuroprotection against TNF-alpha involves the stimulation of Tcf/Lef signaling through EP1-  EP2-  and EP4-mediated increases of beta-catenin in SH-SY5Y cells. In addition  this PGE2 effect appears to be dependent on the activation of protein kinase A  phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase  phospholipase C  and to a lesser extent protein kinase C. Thus  the molecular mechanism governing the inhibitory effect of PGE2 against TNF-alpha may involve the activation and cross talk of multiple signal transduction and play an important role in regulating the survival of neurons during the neurotoxic inflammatory response associated with neurodegenerative diseases including AD.,0,Mechanisms involved in prostaglandin E2-mediated neuroprotection against TNF-alpha: possible involvement of multiple signal transduction and beta-catenin/T-cell factor.Cerebrospinal fluid prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) levels are elevated in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD)  which suggests that they are involved in neurodegeneration.

Currently available techniques cannot decisively address this issue. In this respect  antimicrobial peptide Tc-ubiquicidin (UBI) 29-41 scans have been showing interesting results. The aim of this study was to determine the accuracy of Tc-UBI scan in the detection of osteomyelitis and to compare it with Tc-methylene diphosphonate scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). METHODS: Twenty patients (mean age=48.90 years) with suspected osteomyelitis were included in this study. After evaluation of each patient through history taking  physical examination  appropriate laboratory tests  and other processes including bone probing  wound culture  and plain film radiography  MRIs  Tc-UBI scans  and Tc-methylene diphosphonate scans were performed. For quantitative analysis  the mean count of abnormal-to-normal (A/N) region was calculated for images acquired at 15  30  45  60  120  and 240 min to obtain the most favorable time for imaging. RESULTS: In total  osteomyelitis was detected in the Tc-UBI scans of 17 patients  indicating 100% accuracy  compared with an accuracy of 90% for osteomyelitis detected in three-phase bone scans. The maximum mean A/N was observed at 15 min after intravenous injection (median: 1.91; interquartile range: 1.54-2.94). MRI was performed in 12 cases only with 75% accuracy. In addition  the A/N ratios for the Tc-UBI scans were not significantly different between patients with or without Staphylococcus aureus growth on wound cultures. CONCLUSION: For fast imaging with high accuracy  Tc-UBI 29-41 is a suitable choice for the detection of osteomyelitis.,0,Diagnostic value of 99mTc-ubiquicidin scintigraphy for osteomyelitis and comparisons with 99mTc-methylene diphosphonate scintigraphy and magnetic resonance imagingOBJECTIVE: The discrimination of bacterial infections from sterile inflammatory processes is of great importance in the management of inflammation.

This powerful but simple concept is widely used by the public media, scientists, and political decision makers to explain and justify political strategies to control the COVID-19 pandemic. Here we explore the effectiveness of political interventions using the reproduction number of COVID-19 across Europe. We propose a dynamic SEIR epidemiology model with a time-varying reproduction number, which we identify using machine learning. During the early outbreak, the basic reproduction number was 4.22 +/- 1.69, with maximum values of 6.33 and 5.88 in Germany and the Netherlands. By May 10, 2020, it dropped to 0.67 +/- 0.18, with minimum values of 0.37 and 0.28 in Hungary and Slovakia. We found a strong correlation between passenger air travel, driving, walking, and transit mobility and the effective reproduction number with a time delay of 17.24 +/- 2.00 days.

13944,Pitavastatin decreases tau levels via the inactivation of Rho/ROCK.,Epidemiological studies have shown that long-term treatment with statins decreases the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. Statins have pleiotropic effects by lowering the concentration of isoprenoid intermediates. Although several studies have shown that statins may reduce amyloid beta protein levels  there have been few reports on the interaction between statins and tau. We report here that pitavastatin reduces total and phosphorylated tau levels in a cellular model of tauopathy  and in primary neuronal cultures. The decrease caused by pitavastatin is reversed by the addition of mevalonate  or geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate. The maturation of small G proteins  including RhoA was disrupted by pitavastatin  as was the activity of glycogen synthase kinase 3EEE (GSK3EEE)  a major tau kinase. Toxin A  inhibitor of glycosylation of small G proteins  and Rho kinase (ROCK) inhibitor decreased phosphorylated tau levels.

31074,Induced beta-barrel formation of the Alzheimer's Abeta25-35 oligomers on carbon nanotube surfaces: implication for amyloid fibril inhibition.,Recent experimental studies show that carbon nanotubes impact the aggregation process of proteins associated with neurodegenerative diseases. However  the details of molecular interactions between proteins and carbon nanotubes are still not well understood. In this study  we investigate the initial adsorption features and dynamics of the Alzheimer's amyloid-beta peptide spanning residues 25-35 (Abeta25-35) on a single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT) surface using fully atomic molecular dynamics simulations (MD) in explicit solvent. The initial configurations of the Abeta25-35 peptides consist of two preformed bilayer beta-sheets  each with four or five beta-strands in parallel or mixed antiparallel-parallel orientations. Our simulations show  for what we believe is the first time  that two disjointed Abeta25-35 beta-sheets with mixed antiparallel-parallel strands can assemble into beta-barrels wrapping the SWNT. In contrast  both simulations of Abeta25-35 without SWNT  and simulations of SWNT-Abeta25-35 with purely parallel beta-strands  lead to disordered aggregates. We find that Abeta25-35 beta-barrel formation involves at least two steps: i)  curving of the Abeta25-35 beta-sheets as a result of strong hydrophobic interactions with carbon nanotube concomitantly with dehydration of the SWNT-peptide interface; and ii)  intersheet backbone hydrogen bond formation with fluctuating intrasheet hydrogen bonds. Detailed analysis of the conversion shows that beta-barrel formation on SWNT surface results from the interplay of dehydration and peptide-SWNT/peptide-peptide interactions. Implications of our results on amyloid fibril inhibition are discussed.,0,Induced beta-barrel formation of the Alzheimer's Abeta25-35 oligomers on carbon nanotube surfaces: implication for amyloid fibril inhibition.Recent experimental studies show that carbon nanotubes impact the aggregation process of proteins associated with neurodegenerative diseases.

The initial configurations of the Abeta25-35 peptides consist of two preformed bilayer beta-sheets  each with four or five beta-strands in parallel or mixed antiparallel-parallel orientations. Our simulations show  for what we believe is the first time  that two disjointed Abeta25-35 beta-sheets with mixed antiparallel-parallel strands can assemble into beta-barrels wrapping the SWNT. In contrast  both simulations of Abeta25-35 without SWNT  and simulations of SWNT-Abeta25-35 with purely parallel beta-strands  lead to disordered aggregates. We find that Abeta25-35 beta-barrel formation involves at least two steps: i)  curving of the Abeta25-35 beta-sheets as a result of strong hydrophobic interactions with carbon nanotube concomitantly with dehydration of the SWNT-peptide interface; and ii)  intersheet backbone hydrogen bond formation with fluctuating intrasheet hydrogen bonds. Detailed analysis of the conversion shows that beta-barrel formation on SWNT surface results from the interplay of dehydration and peptide-SWNT/peptide-peptide interactions. Implications of our results on amyloid fibril inhibition are discussed.,"{'judgement': 'False', 'index': 212}",0,"{'judgement': 'False', 'index': 212}",0,"{'judgement': 'False', 'index': 212}",0,"{'judgement': 'False', 'index': 212}",0,"{'judgement': '', 'probability': '', 'index': 212}",
16728,Analysis of Gender-Dependent Personal Protective Behaviors in a National Sample: Polish Adolescents' COVID-19 Experience (PLACE-19) Study,"During the coronavirus-19 disease (COVID-19) pandemic, the basic strategy that is recommended to reduce the spread of the disease is to practice proper hand hygiene and personal protective behaviors, but among adolescents, low adherence is common. The present study aimed to assess the gender-dependent hand hygiene and personal protective behaviors in a national sample of Polish adolescents. The Polish Adolescents' COVID-19 Experience (PLACE-19) Study was conducted in a group of 2323 secondary school students (814 males, 1509 females). Schools were chosen based on the random quota sampling procedure. The participants were surveyed to assess their knowledge and beliefs associated with hand hygiene and personal protection, as well as their actual behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic. The majority of respondents gave proper answers when asked about their knowledge. However, females displayed a higher level of knowledge (p < 0.05). Most of the respondents declared not leaving home, handwashing, using alcohol-based hand rub, avoiding contact with those who may be sick, and avoiding public places as their personal protective behaviors. They declared using face masks and gloves after the legal regulation requiring people to cover their nose and mouth in public places was enacted in Poland. Regarding the use of face masks and not touching the face, no gender-dependent differences were observed, while for all the other behaviors, females declared more adherence than males (p < 0.05). Females also declared a higher daily frequency of handwashing (p < 0.0001) and washing their hands always when necessary more often than males (68.2% vs. 54.1%; p < 0.0001). Males more often indicated various reasons for not handwashing, including that there is no need to do it, they do not feel like doing it, they have no time to do it, or they forget about it (p < 0.0001), while females pointed out side effects (e.g., skin problems) as the reason (p = 0.0278). Females more often declared handwashing in circumstances associated with socializing, being exposed to contact with other people and health (p < 0.05), and declared always including the recommended steps in their handwashing procedure (p < 0.05). The results showed that female secondary school students exhibited a higher level of knowledge on hand hygiene and personal protection, as well as better behaviors, compared to males.

14585,Renal Involvement and Early Prognosis in Patients with COVID-19 Pneumonia,"BACKGROUND: Some patients with COVID-19 pneumonia also present with kidney injury, and autopsy findings of patients who died from the illness sometimes show renal damage. However, little is known about the clinical characteristics of kidney-related complications, including hematuria, proteinuria, and AKI. METHOD(S): In this retrospective, single-center study in China, we analyzed data from electronic medical records of 333 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, including information about clinical, laboratory, radiologic, and other characteristics, as well as information about renal outcomes. RESULT(S): We found that 251 of the 333 patients (75.4%) had abnormal urine dipstick tests or AKI. Of 198 patients with renal involvement for the median duration of 12 days, 118 (59.6%) experienced remission of pneumonia during this period, and 111 of 162 (68.5%) patients experienced remission of proteinuria. Among 35 patients who developed AKI (with AKI identified by criteria expanded somewhat beyond the 2012 Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes definition), 16 (45.7%) experienced complete recovery of kidney function. We suspect that most AKI cases were intrinsic AKI. Patients with renal involvement had higher overall mortality compared with those without renal involvement (28 of 251 [11.2%] versus one of 82 [1.2%], respectively). Stepwise multivariate binary logistic regression analyses showed that severity of pneumonia was the risk factor most commonly associated with lower odds of proteinuric or hematuric remission and recovery from AKI. CONCLUSION(S): Renal abnormalities occurred in the majority of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Although proteinuria, hematuria, and AKI often resolved in such patients within 3 weeks after the onset of symptoms, renal complications in COVID-19 were associated with higher mortality.Copyright ÁE© 2020 by the American Society of Nephrology.",0,"Renal Involvement and Early Prognosis in Patients with COVID-19 PneumoniaBACKGROUND: Some patients with COVID-19 pneumonia also present with kidney injury, and autopsy findings of patients who died from the illness sometimes show renal damage.

58994,Broad-spectrum effects of 4-aminopyridine to modulate amyloid beta1-42-induced cell signaling and functional responses in human microglia.,We investigated the modulating actions of the nonselective K(+) channel blocker 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) on amyloid beta (Abeta(1-42))-induced human microglial signaling pathways and functional processes. Whole-cell patch-clamp studies showed acute application of Abeta(1-42) (5 mum) to human microglia led to rapid expression of a 4-AP-sensitive  non-inactivating outwardly rectifying K(+) current (I(K)). Intracellular application of the nonhydrolyzable analog of GTP  GTPgammaS  induced an outward K(+) current with similar properties to the Abeta(1-42)-induced I(K) including sensitivity to 4-AP (IC(50) = 5 mm). Reverse transcriptase-PCR showed a rapid expression of a delayed rectifier Kv3.1 channel in Abeta(1-42)-treated microglia. Abeta(1-42) peptide also caused a slow  progressive increase in levels of [Ca(2+)](i) (intracellular calcium) that was partially blocked by 4-AP. Chronic exposure of human microglia to Abeta(1-42) led to enhanced p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and nuclear factor kappaB expression with factors inhibited by 4-AP. Abeta(1-42) also induced the expression and production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1beta  IL-6  and tumor necrosis factor-alpha  the chemokine IL-8  and the enzyme cyclooxygenase-2; 4-AP was effective in reducing all of these pro-inflammatory mediators. Additionally  toxicity of supernatant from Abeta(1-42)-treated microglia on cultured rat hippocampal neurons was reduced if 4-AP was included with peptide. In vivo  injection of Abeta(1-42) into rat hippocampus induced neuronal damage and increased microglial activation. Daily administration of 1 mg/kg 4-AP was found to suppress microglial activation and exhibited neuroprotection. The overall results suggest that 4-AP modulation of an Abeta(1-42)-induced I(K) (candidate channel Kv3.1) and intracellular signaling pathways in human microglia could serve as a therapeutic strategy for neuroprotection in Alzheimer's disease pathology.,0,Broad-spectrum effects of 4-aminopyridine to modulate amyloid beta1-42-induced cell signaling and functional responses in human microglia.We investigated the modulating actions of the nonselective K(+) channel blocker 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) on amyloid beta (Abeta(1-42))-induced human microglial signaling pathways and functional processes.

42104,Pro-inflammatory effect of freshly solubilized beta-amyloid peptides in the brain.,It has recently been shown that the level of soluble beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptides correlates well with the severity of synaptic loss and the density of neurofibrillary tangles observed in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain. However  the biological activity of soluble forms of Abeta peptides in the brain remains to be determined. We have investigated ex vivo the effect of freshly solubilized Abeta1-40 peptides (fsAbeta) on prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production in rat brain slices. PGE2 levels increased rapidly following treatment with fsAbeta  an effect that was prevented by SB202190  a selective inhibitor of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK)  and by NS-398  which preferentially inhibits cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) compared to COX-1. In an attempt to determine the cellular systems of the brain responsible for prostaglandin production in response to fsAbeta  the effect of fsAbeta was tested on isolated brain microvessels  primary cultures of brain smooth muscle cells/pericytes and endothelial cells  and a human neuron-like cell line (IMR32). Our data show that fsAbeta ex vivo can stimulate prostaglandin accumulation in incubates of isolated rat brain microvessels. In addition  fsAbeta appears to cause a concentration-dependent enhancement of prostaglandin accumulation in primary cultures of brain microvessel-derived smooth muscle cells/pericytes but not of brain endothelial cells. Finally  fsAbeta also stimulated PGF2alpha accumulation in cultures of differentiated IMR32 cells  but to a lesser extent than in brain smooth muscle cell/pericyte cultures. Deposition of aggregated forms of Abeta in the brain has been thought to trigger an inflammatory response which accompanies the neuropathologic events of AD. Our data provide evidence that fsAbeta triggers a pro-inflammatory reaction in rat brain  and suggest that the cerebrovasculature may constitute an important source of pro-inflammatory eicosanoids.,0,Pro-inflammatory effect of freshly solubilized beta-amyloid peptides in the brain.It has recently been shown that the level of soluble beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptides correlates well with the severity of synaptic loss and the density of neurofibrillary tangles observed in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain.

50193,Persistence and clearance of viral RNA in 2019 novel coronavirus disease rehabilitation patients,"BACKGROUND: A patient's infectivity is determined by the presence of the virus in different body fluids, secretions, and excreta. The persistence and clearance of viral RNA from different specimens of patients with 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) remain unclear. This study analyzed the clearance time and factors influencing 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) RNA in different samples from patients with COVID-19, providing further evidence to improve the management of patients during convalescence. METHODS: The clinical data and laboratory test results of convalescent patients with COVID-19 who were admitted to from January 20, 2020 to February 10, 2020 were collected retrospectively. The reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results for patients' oropharyngeal swab, stool, urine, and serum samples were collected and analyzed. Convalescent patients refer to recovered non-febrile patients without respiratory symptoms who had two successive (minimum 24 h sampling interval) negative RT-PCR results for viral RNA from oropharyngeal swabs. The effects of cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4)+ T lymphocytes, inflammatory indicators, and glucocorticoid treatment on viral nucleic acid clearance were analyzed. RESULTS: In the 292 confirmed cases, 66 patients recovered after treatment and were included in our study. In total, 28 (42.4%) women and 38 men (57.6%) with a median age of 44.0 (34.0-62.0) years were analyzed. After in-hospital treatment, patients' inflammatory indicators decreased with improved clinical condition. The median time from the onset of symptoms to first negative RT-PCR results for oropharyngeal swabs in convalescent patients was 9.5 (6.0-11.0) days. By February 10, 2020, 11 convalescent patients (16.7%) still tested positive for viral RNA from stool specimens and the other 55 patients' stool specimens were negative for 2019-nCoV following a median duration of 11.0 (9.0-16.0) days after symptom onset. Among these 55 patients, 43 had a longer duration until stool specimens were negative for viral RNA than for throat swabs, with a median delay of 2.0 (1.0-4.0) days. Results for only four (6.9%) urine samples were positive for viral nucleic acid out of 58 cases; viral RNA was still present in three patients' urine specimens after throat swabs were negative. Using a multiple linear regression model (F = 2.669, P = 0.044, and adjusted R = 0.122), the analysis showed that the CD4+ T lymphocyte count may help predict the duration of viral RNA detection in patients' stools (t = -2.699, P = 0.010). The duration of viral RNA detection from oropharyngeal swabs and fecal samples in the glucocorticoid treatment group was longer than that in the non-glucocorticoid treatment group (15 days vs. 8.0 days, respectively; t = 2.550, P = 0.013) and the duration of viral RNA detection in fecal samples in the glucocorticoid treatment group was longer than that in the non-glucocorticoid treatment group (20 days vs. 11 days, respectively; t = 4.631, P < 0.001). There was no statistically significant difference in inflammatory indicators between patients with positive fecal viral RNA test results and those with negative results (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In brief, as the clearance of viral RNA in patients' stools was delayed compared to that in oropharyngeal swabs, it is important to identify viral RNA in feces during convalescence. Because of the delayed clearance of viral RNA in the glucocorticoid treatment group, glucocorticoids are not recommended in the treatment of COVID-19, especially for mild disease. The duration of RNA detection may relate to host cell immunity.",0,"Persistence and clearance of viral RNA in 2019 novel coronavirus disease rehabilitation patientsBACKGROUND: A patient's infectivity is determined by the presence of the virus in different body fluids, secretions, and excreta.

By February 10, 2020, 11 convalescent patients (16.7%) still tested positive for viral RNA from stool specimens and the other 55 patients' stool specimens were negative for 2019-nCoV following a median duration of 11.0 (9.0-16.0) days after symptom onset. Among these 55 patients, 43 had a longer duration until stool specimens were negative for viral RNA than for throat swabs, with a median delay of 2.0 (1.0-4.0) days. Results for only four (6.9%) urine samples were positive for viral nucleic acid out of 58 cases; viral RNA was still present in three patients' urine specimens after throat swabs were negative. Using a multiple linear regression model (F = 2.669, P = 0.044, and adjusted R = 0.122), the analysis showed that the CD4+ T lymphocyte count may help predict the duration of viral RNA detection in patients' stools (t = -2.699, P = 0.010). The duration of viral RNA detection from oropharyngeal swabs and fecal samples in the glucocorticoid treatment group was longer than that in the non-glucocorticoid treatment group (15 days vs. 8.0 days, respectively; t = 2.550, P = 0.013) and the duration of viral RNA detection in fecal samples in the glucocorticoid treatment group was longer than that in the non-glucocorticoid treatment group (20 days vs. 11 days, respectively; t = 4.631, P < 0.001). There was no statistically significant difference in inflammatory indicators between patients with positive fecal viral RNA test results and those with negative results (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In brief, as the clearance of viral RNA in patients' stools was delayed compared to that in oropharyngeal swabs, it is important to identify viral RNA in feces during convalescence. Because of the delayed clearance of viral RNA in the glucocorticoid treatment group, glucocorticoids are not recommended in the treatment of COVID-19, especially for mild disease. The duration of RNA detection may relate to host cell immunity.","{'judgement': 'False', 'index': 219}",0,"{'judgement': 'False', 'index': 219}",0,"{'judgement': 'False', 'index': 219}",0,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 219}",1,"{'judgement': 'False', 'index': 219}",0
49031,Status epilepticus and other EEG findings in patients with COVID-19: A case series,"PURPOSE: Neurological manifestations of COVID-19 infection include impaired consciousness, strokes, and seizures. Limited reports describing EEG abnormalities in patients with COVID-19 have been published. These articles reported nonspecific encephalopathic patterns, epileptiform discharges, and rarely seizures. Our primary aim was to assess EEG abnormalities in patients with COVID-19 and evaluate for epileptiform activity or seizures. METHODS: We identified five critically ill adult patients with COVID-19 who underwent EEG monitoring. All patients had Ceribell TM rapid response EEG initially and two continued with conventional long-term video EEG. RESULTS: All 5 patients had encephalopathy and 3 also had seizure-like movements, thus prompting EEG monitoring. EEGs all showed nonspecific markers of encephalopathy including diffuse slowing and generalized rhythmic delta activity. Two also had epileptiform discharges reaching 2-3 Hz at times, with one patient in nonconvulsive status epilepticus and the other developing clinical status epilepticus with myoclonic movements. EEG and clinical symptoms improved with anti-seizure medications. CONCLUSION: Status epilepticus was present in 2 out of our cohort of 5 critically ill patients who underwent EEG monitoring. These findings highlight the importance of EEG monitoring in high-risk patients with COVID-19 and encephalopathy. EEG recordings in such patients can identify pathological patterns that will benefit from treatment with anti-seizure medications. Copyright ÁE© 2020 British Epilepsy Association.

38120,Development and Validation of the Quick COVID-19 Severity Index: A Prognostic Tool for Early Clinical Decompensation,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study is to create a predictive, interpretable model of early hospital respiratory failure among emergency department (ED) patients admitted with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: This was an observational, retrospective, cohort study from a 9-ED health system of admitted adult patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (COVID-19) and an oxygen requirement less than or equal to 6 L/min. We sought to predict respiratory failure within 24 hours of admission as defined by oxygen requirement of greater than 10 L/min by low-flow device, high-flow device, noninvasive or invasive ventilation, or death. Predictive models were compared with the Elixhauser Comorbidity Index, quick Sequential [Sepsis-related] Organ Failure Assessment, and the CURB-65 pneumonia severity score. RESULTS: During the study period, from March 1 to April 27, 2020, 1,792 patients were admitted with COVID-19, 620 (35%) of whom had respiratory failure in the ED. Of the remaining 1,172 admitted patients, 144 (12.3%) met the composite endpoint within the first 24 hours of hospitalization. On the independent test cohort, both a novel bedside scoring system, the quick COVID-19 Severity Index (area under receiver operating characteristic curve mean 0.81 [95% confidence interval {CI} 0.73 to 0.89]), and a machine-learning model, the COVID-19 Severity Index (mean 0.76 [95% CI 0.65 to 0.86]), outperformed the Elixhauser mortality index (mean 0.61 [95% CI 0.51 to 0.70]), CURB-65 (0.50 [95% CI 0.40 to 0.60]), and quick Sequential [Sepsis-related] Organ Failure Assessment (0.59 [95% CI 0.50 to 0.68]). A low quick COVID-19 Severity Index score was associated with a less than 5% risk of respiratory decompensation in the validation cohort.

15545,Comparison of hospital worker anxiety in COVID-19 treating and non-treating hospitals in the same city during the COVID-19 pandemic,"BACKGROUND: The Hadassah Medical Organization operates two hospitals in Jerusalem. During the COVID-19 pandemic it made an administrative decision to operate one hospital as a COVID-19 treatment hospital (CTH) and to have the second function as a non-COVID-19 treating hospital (NCTH) offering general medical services. The purpose of this study was to assess how this decision affected hospital worker anxiety. METHODS: From April 27 to May 1, during the COVID-19 pandemic in Israel, while the country was under lock-down, an electronic questionnaire survey was carried out among hospital workers of the CTH and NCTH. The questionnaire includes personal demographics and attitudes about COVID-19 and assesses present anxiety state using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Adults (STAI-S) validated questionnaire. A STAI-S score of >=45 was considered to represent clinical anxiety. RESULTS: Completed questionnaires were received from 1570 hospital employees (24%). 33.5% of responders had STAI-S scores >=45. Multivariable regression analysis showed that being a resident doctor (odds ration [OR] 2.13; 95% CL, 1.41-3.23; P = 0.0003), age <= 50 (OR, 2.08; 95% Cl, 1.62-2.67; P < .0001), being a nurse (OR, 1.29; 95% CL, 1.01-1.64; P = 0.039), female gender (OR, 1.63; 95% CL, 1.25-2.13; P = 0.0003) and having risk factors for COVID-19 (OR, 1.51; 95% CL, 1.19-1.91; P = 0.0007), but not hospital workplace (p = 0.08), were associated with the presence of clinical anxiety. 69% of the responders had been tested for COVID-19, but only nine were positive. CTH workers estimated that the likelihood of their already being infected with COVID-19 to be 21.5 +/- 24.7% as compared to the 15.3 +/- 19.5% estimate of NCTH workers (p = 0.0001). 50% (545/1099) of the CTH workers and 51% (168/330) of the NCTH workers responded that the most important cause of their stress was a fear of infecting their families (p = 0.7).

14885,The Direct and Indirect Impact of SARS-CoV-2 Infections on Neonates: A Series of 26 Cases in Bangladesh,"BACKGROUND: The impact of SARS-CoV-2 on neonates remains largely unknown in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). We provide an epidemiological and clinical report of SARS-CoV-2 infections in neonates hospitalized in Bangladesh. METHODS: Outborn neonates admitted to Dhaka Shishu Hospital, a tertiary-care referral hospital, between 29 March and 1 July were screened for SARS-CoV-2. We reviewed clinical data, including chest X-rays and laboratory reports, and conducted SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing. Patients were followed-up for 27-75 days. A subset of caregivers was also tested. RESULTS: Of 83 neonates tested, 26 were positive (median age 8 days). Most neonates were admitted with diagnosis unrelated to SARS-CoV-2: 11 presented with serious non-communicable diseases, 7 with early-onset sepsis, 5 with late-onset sepsis and 2 with pneumonia. In 3 of 5 chest X-rays, infiltrates and ground-glass or patchy opacities were noted. Two neonates developed metabolic acidosis, one developed disseminated intravascular coagulation. Most SARS-CoV-2 positive neonates were referred to government-designated COVID-19 hospitals, leading to gaps in treatment. Twenty-three neonates could be followed-up: 12 were healthy, 8 died and 3 were still seeking medical care. Of 9 caregivers tested, 8 were positive. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 may have serious adverse effects on children born in LMICs. The virus likely contributed directly to two deaths, but the remaining 6 neonates who died had serious comorbidities. Positive SARS-CoV-2 test results led to gaps in immediate clinical care for other morbidities, which likely contributed to adverse outcomes.

The RNA aptamer is transcribed by the T7 RNA polymerase from the ligation product of a promoter DNA probe and a reporter DNA probe that hybridize with the target single-stranded RNA sequence via the SplintR ligase (a Chlorella virus DNA ligase). In 40 nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 samples, the assay reached positive and negative predictive values of 95 and 100%, respectively.

46807,A Retrospective Controlled Cohort Study of the Impact of Glucocorticoid Treatment in SARS-CoV-2 Infection Mortality,"Evidence to support the use of steroids in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia is lacking. We aim to determine the impact of steroid use for COVID-19 pneumonia on hospital mortality. We performed a single-center retrospective cohort study in a university hospital in Madrid, Spain, during March of 2020. To determine the role of steroids in in-hospital mortality, patients admitted with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pneumonia and treated with steroids were compared to patients not treated with steroids, and we adjusted with a propensity score for patients on steroid treatment. Survival times were compared using the log rank test. Different steroid regimens were compared and adjusted with a second propensity score. During the study period, 463 out of 848 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia fulfilled inclusion criteria. Among them, 396 (46.7%) patients were treated with steroids and 67 patients were not. Global mortality was 15.1%. The median time to steroid treatment from symptom onset was 10days (interquartile range [IQR], 8 to 13 days). In-hospital mortality was lower in patients treated with steroids than in controls (13.9% [55/396] versus 23.9% [16/67]; hazard ratio [HR], 0.51 [95% confidence interval, 0.27 to 0.96]; P = 0.044). Steroid treatment reduced mortality by 41.8% relative to the mortality with no steroid treatment (relative risk reduction, 0.42 [95% confidence interval, 0.048 to 0.65]). Initial treatment with 1mg/kg of body weight/day of methylprednisolone versus steroid pulses was not associated with in-hospital mortality (13.5% [42/310] versus 15.1% [13/86]; odds ratio [OR], 0.880 [95% confidence interval, 0.449 to 1.726]; P=0.710). Our results show that the survival of patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is higher in patients treated with glucocorticoids than in those not treated. Rates of in-hospital mortality were not different between initial regimens of 1mg/kg/day of methylprednisolone and glucocorticoid pulses.Copyright ÁE© ",0,"A Retrospective Controlled Cohort Study of the Impact of Glucocorticoid Treatment in SARS-CoV-2 Infection MortalityEvidence to support the use of steroids in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia is lacking. We aim to determine the impact of steroid use for COVID-19 pneumonia on hospital mortality. We performed a single-center retrospective cohort study in a university hospital in Madrid, Spain, during March of 2020. To determine the role of steroids in in-hospital mortality, patients admitted with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pneumonia and treated with steroids were compared to patients not treated with steroids, and we adjusted with a propensity score for patients on steroid treatment. Survival times were compared using the log rank test. Different steroid regimens were compared and adjusted with a second propensity score. During the study period, 463 out of 848 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia fulfilled inclusion criteria. Among them, 396 (46.7%) patients were treated with steroids and 67 patients were not. Global mortality was 15.1%. The median time to steroid treatment from symptom onset was 10days (interquartile range [IQR], 8 to 13 days). In-hospital mortality was lower in patients treated with steroids than in controls (13.9% [55/396] versus 23.9% [16/67]; hazard ratio [HR], 0.51 [95% confidence interval, 0.27 to 0.96]; P = 0.044). Steroid treatment reduced mortality by 41.8% relative to the mortality with no steroid treatment (relative risk reduction, 0.42 [95% confidence interval, 0.048 to 0.65]). Initial treatment with 1mg/kg of body weight/day of methylprednisolone versus steroid pulses was not associated with in-hospital mortality (13.5% [42/310] versus 15.1% [13/86]; odds ratio [OR], 0.880 [95% confidence interval, 0.449 to 1.726]; P=0.710).

4923,Operational definitions improve reliability of the age-related white matter changes scale.,BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Although the age-related white matter changes (ARWMC) scale has been advocated to be applicable to both MRI and CT for assessing the severity of WMC  its inter-rater reliability on CT is only fair. We aimed to operationalize the ARWMC scale and investigate the effect of this operationalization on the reliability and validity on MRI and CT. METHODS: Operational definitions of the ARWMC scale were derived from Erkinjuntti research criteria for subcortical vascular dementia and Scheltens scale. Using original and operationalized ARWMC scale  eight observers recorded the time for rating per MRI and per CT. We investigated the inter-rater and intrarater reliability as well as validity against volume using data from 97 stroke patients. RESULTS: Inter-rater reliability of the operationalized scale on CT (0.874  95% confidence interval [0.780-0.934]) was better than the original scale (0.569  95% confidence interval [0.247-0.775]). Its intrarater reliability on CT (0.869) and reliability on MRI (inter-rater: 0.860; intrarater: 0.838) was comparable with the original scale (CT intrarater: 0.750 and on MRI inter-rater: 0.845; intrarater: 0.853). The time required to administer the operationalized scale (4'2EE for MRI and 1'18EE for CT) was similar to that of the original scale (3'56EE for MRI and 1'16EE for CT). The original scale and operationalized scale also significantly correlated with WMC volume (operationalized scale EE = 0.613  P < 0.001  original scale EE = 0.638  P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Operational definitions improve the inter-rater reliability of ARWMC scale on CT  and it correlates with volumetric measurement.,0,Operational definitions improve reliability of the age-related white matter changes scale.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Although the age-related white matter changes (ARWMC) scale has been advocated to be applicable to both MRI and CT for assessing the severity of WMC  its inter-rater reliability on CT is only fair.

32896,Gastrointestinal involvement in covid-19 patients: A retrospective study from a greek covid-19 referral hospital,"Background Much attention has been paid to the study and reporting of gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms in COVID-19 patients. Moreover, an increasing number of COVID-19 patients have been noted to experience hepatic and pancreatic injury. In this study, we retrospectively investigated symptoms and laboratory findings related to the GI system in a single center in Athens, Greece, and assessed the role of these parameters in relation to survival and disease severity. Method We retrospectively studied 61 adult COVID-19 patients admitted to the Army Share Fund Hospital (NIMTS) in Athens, Greece, from April 6th to May 6th, 2020. Results Sixty-one COVID-19 cases were assessed in the study period. Regarding both survival and disease severity, diarrhea was the most common finding. The multivariate analysis revealed that elevated serum aspartate aminotransferase levels and low serum albumin levels were associated with worse patient survival (odds ratio [OR] 1.029, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.007-1.05, P=0.0088; and OR 0.219, 95%CI 0.066-0.723, P=0.0127, respectively). As far as disease severity is concerned, only a low serum albumin level (measured at hospital admission) was correlated with more severe disease (OR 0.025, 95%CI 0.004-0.161, P=0.0001). Conclusions Outpatients with new-onset GI symptoms should be considered for COVID-19 testing in a high COVID-19 prevalence setting, as these symptoms are observed more and more in clinical settings. As prospective studies begin to emerge, clinicians will have more robust research data to diagnose COVID-19 patients earlier and identify patients in need of more intensive treatment.Copyright ÁE© 2020 Hellenic Society of Gastroenterology.",0,"Gastrointestinal involvement in covid-19 patients: A retrospective study from a greek covid-19 referral hospitalBackground Much attention has been paid to the study and reporting of gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms in COVID-19 patients.

28863,Enhancing dentate gyrus function with dietary flavanols improves cognition in older adults.,The dentate gyrus (DG) is a region in the hippocampal formation whose function declines in association with human aging and is therefore considered to be a possible source of age-related memory decline. Causal evidence is needed  however  to show that DG-associated memory decline in otherwise healthy elders can be improved by interventions that enhance DG function. We addressed this issue by first using a high-resolution variant of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to map the precise site of age-related DG dysfunction and to develop a cognitive task whose function localized to this anatomical site. Then  in a controlled randomized trial  we applied these tools to study healthy 50-69-year-old subjects who consumed either a high or low cocoa flavanol-containing diet for 3 months. A high-flavanol intervention was found to enhance DG function  as measured by fMRI and by cognitive testing. Our findings establish that DG dysfunction is a driver of age-related cognitive decline and suggest non-pharmacological means for its amelioration.,0,Enhancing dentate gyrus function with dietary flavanols improves cognition in older adults.The dentate gyrus (DG) is a region in the hippocampal formation whose function declines in association with human aging and is therefore considered to be a possible source of age-related memory decline.

25031,Alzheimer's disease-like tau neuropathology leads to memory deficits and loss of functional synapses in a novel mutated tau transgenic mouse without any motor deficits.,Tau transgenic mice are valuable models to investigate the role of tau protein in Alzheimer's disease and other tauopathies. However  motor dysfunction and dystonic posture interfering with behavioral testing are the most common undesirable effects of tau transgenic mice. Therefore  we have generated a novel mouse model (THY-Tau22) that expresses human 4-repeat tau mutated at sites G272V and P301S under a Thy1.2-promotor  displaying tau pathology in the absence of any motor dysfunction. THY-Tau22 shows hyperphosphorylation of tau on several Alzheimer's disease-relevant tau epitopes (AT8  AT100  AT180  AT270  12E8  tau-pSer396  and AP422)  neurofibrillary tangle-like inclusions (Gallyas and MC1-positive) with rare ghost tangles and PHF-like filaments  as well as mild astrogliosis. These mice also display deficits in hippocampal synaptic transmission and impaired behavior characterized by increased anxiety  delayed learning from 3 months  and reduced spatial memory at 10 months. There are no signs of motor deficits or changes in motor activity at any age investigated. This mouse model therefore displays the main features of tau pathology and several of the pathophysiological disturbances observed during neurofibrillary degeneration. This model will serve as an experimental tool in future studies to investigate mechanisms underlying cognitive deficits during pathogenic tau aggregation.,0,Alzheimer's disease-like tau neuropathology leads to memory deficits and loss of functional synapses in a novel mutated tau transgenic mouse without any motor deficits.Tau transgenic mice are valuable models to investigate the role of tau protein in Alzheimer's disease and other tauopathies.

62572,Psychological and Behavioural Responses to Coronavirus Disease 2019: The Role of Personality,"This study examined the associations between personality traits and psychological and behavioural responses to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Personality was assessed in January/February 2020 when the public was not aware of the spread of coronavirus in the USA. Participants were reassessed in late March 2020 with four sets of questions about the pandemic: concerns, precautions, preparatory behaviours, and duration estimates. The sample consisted of N = 2066 participants (mean age = 51.42; range = 18-98; 48.5% women). Regression models were used to analyse the data with age, gender, education, race, and ethnicity as covariates. Consistent with the preregistered hypotheses, higher neuroticism was related to more concerns and longer duration estimates related to COVID-19, higher extraversion was related to shorter duration estimates, and higher conscientiousness was associated with more precautions. In contrast to the preregistered hypotheses, higher neuroticism was associated with fewer precautions and unrelated to preparatory behaviours. Age moderated several trait-response associations, suggesting that some of the responses were associated more strongly in older adults, a group at risk for complications of COVID-19. For example, older adults high in conscientiousness prepared more. The present findings provide insights into how personality predicts concerns and behaviours related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Consistent with the preregistered hypotheses, higher neuroticism was related to more concerns and longer duration estimates related to COVID-19, higher extraversion was related to shorter duration estimates, and higher conscientiousness was associated with more precautions. In contrast to the preregistered hypotheses, higher neuroticism was associated with fewer precautions and unrelated to preparatory behaviours. Age moderated several trait-response associations, suggesting that some of the responses were associated more strongly in older adults, a group at risk for complications of COVID-19. For example, older adults high in conscientiousness prepared more. The present findings provide insights into how personality predicts concerns and behaviours related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The role of these N-terminal fragments in disease pathogenesis has been questioned based in part on studies in transgenic mice. In one important example  mice that express an N-terminal fragment of mutant htt terminating at the C-terminus of exon 2 (termed the Shortstop mouse) were reported to develop robust inclusion pathology without developing phenotypic abnormalities seen in the R6/2 or N171-82Q models of HD  which are also based on expression of mutant N-terminal htt fragments. To further explore the capacity of mutant exon-2 htt fragments to produce neurologic abnormalities (N-terminal 118 amino acids; N118)  we generated transgenic mice expressing cDNA that encodes htt N118-82Q with the mouse prion promoter vector. In mice generated in this manner  we demonstrate robust inclusion pathology accompanied by early death and failure to gain weight. These phenotypes are the most robust abnormalities identified in the R6/2 and N171-82Q models. We conclude that the lack of an overt phenotype in the initial Shortstop mice cannot be completely explained by the properties of mutant htt N118 fragments.,0,Premature death and neurologic abnormalities in transgenic mice expressing a mutant huntingtin exon-2 fragment.Huntington's disease (HD) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease characterized pathologically by aggregates composed of N-terminal fragments of the mutant form of the protein huntingtin (htt).

In this retrospective observational cohort study drawn from electronic health records we sought to describe the association between mortality and hydroxychloroquine or tocilizumab therapy among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Patients were hospitalized at a 13-hospital network spanning New Jersey USA between March 1, 2020 and April 22, 2020 with positive polymerase chain reaction results for SARS-CoV-2.

26935,"Impact of delayed orthodontic care during COVID-19 pandemic: Emergency, disability, and pain","BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of clinical closure and delayed orthodontic care delivery in terms of types of emergencies, pain intensity, and disability experienced by orthodontic patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This was a descriptive cross-sectional study using an electronic survey that was distributed to orthodontic patients who were not seen in clinic for 2 to 3 months due to clinic closure. The survey included demographics, types of orthodontic emergencies, Numerical Rating Scale, and Manchester Orofacial Pain Disability Scale. RESULTS: There were a total of 150 respondents with mean age of 20 years; 57.33% were female patients. The most common reported orthodontic emergencies were poking wire 30%, debonded brackets 27.3%, bad odor 24%, sharp ligature tie 20%, inflammation and bleeding 9.3%, ulcer 8.7%, and problematic palatal device 8%. Pain was significantly associated with poking wire (P < 0.001), sharp ligature tie (P < 0.01), ulcer (P < 0.05), and problematic palatal device (P < 0.01). Poking wire, sharp ligature tie, and problematic palatal device were found to be significant predictors of pain intensity. Median pain intensity was 3, similar to the median disability score. There was a significant association between pain intensity and disability score (P < 0.01). With each unit increase in pain intensity, the disability score increased by 1.18. CONCLUSIONS: Delay in receiving orthodontic care could result in an orthodontic emergency, yet pain and disability resulting from these events are minimal. The decision to resume clinical service should be evaluated considering risks and benefits in case of the pandemic. Further studies are required. Copyright ÁE© 2020 World Federation of Orthodontists.

35987,Increased aortic stiffness in prepubertal girls with Turner syndrome,Background Aortic dilation and dissection contribute highly to the increased mortality of Turner syndrome (TS) but the exact pathophysiology is not completely understood. Design Prospective case - control study. Methods 15 prepubertal TS girls (median age 10.64  IQ 8.31-11.04) with a tricuspid (TAV  n = 9) or a bicuspid (BAV  n = 6) aortic valve  and 31 sex-  age-  and height-matched healthy controls underwent a cardiac and vascular ultrasound to evaluate aortic dimensions and elastic properties of the aortic wall. Results TS BAV had significantly larger ascending aortic diameters than controls for absolute diameter  22.2 +/- 5.1 mm vs. 18.6 +/- 1.9 mm (p = 0.014) and z-score 1.7 +/- 2.1 vs. 0.1 +/- 0.7 (p = 0.008). Distensibility of the ascending aorta was lower in the TS than in controls (40.2 x 10<sup>-3</sup> kPa<sup>-1</sup>  IQ 31.3-56.2 vs. 62.9 x 10<sup>-3</sup> kPa<sup>-1</sup>  IQ 55.5-76.5  p = 0.003)  both for TS TAV (p = 0.014) and BAV (p = 0.005). Stiffness index was higher in TS than in controls (5.26  IQ 3.34-5.26 vs. 3.23  IQ 2.55-3.24  p = 0.005)  both for TS TAV (p = 0.028) and TS BAV (p = 0.006). Pulse wave velocity was not different between groups. There was no correlation between stiffness and z-score of the ascending aortic diameter. Conclusions In prepubertal TS girls  stiffness of the ascending aorta is increased in patients with a BAV and TAV while dilation of the ascending aorta is more frequent in BAV. This suggests an intrinsic aortic wall abnormality making all TS patients at increased risk for severe aortic complications although the risk is the highest for TS with BAV.

31034,Development and specific induction of apoptosis of cultured cell models overexpressing human tau during neural differentiation: Implication in Alzheimer's disease.,Apoptosis or programmed cell death is considered to be involved in neurodegenerative disorders  including Alzheimer's disease (AD). AD is characterized by intracellular aggregates of hyperphosphorylated tau  a microtubule-associated protein. To investigate the induction of apoptosis by abnormal tau resembling AD  cultured cells may be useful tools. We developed a cell culture model and established NG108-15 and P19 cells stably transfected with human tau  naming them tau/NG and tau/P19 cells  respectively. Increased accumulation and phosphorylation of tau were observed during neural differentiation in tau/NG cells. Tau/P19 cells underwent drastic apoptosis during neural differentiation induced by retinoic acid (RA). Tau protein was distributed throughout the cytoplasm and in specific zones of the nucleus. The cytoplasmic tau was associated with microtubules  but the nucleic tau was observed to form clusters and was associated with RA receptor (RAR). The apoptosis induced by RA was inhibited by the treatment of glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) inhibitor in tau/P19 cells. We propose that translocation of tau into nucleus affects RA signaling in apoptosis via GSK3 in the cells. These cells are useful for monitoring the apoptosis by abundant tau and may be applied to investigate the molecular mechanism of apoptosis resembling AD.,0,Development and specific induction of apoptosis of cultured cell models overexpressing human tau during neural differentiation: Implication in Alzheimer's disease.Apoptosis or programmed cell death is considered to be involved in neurodegenerative disorders  including Alzheimer's disease (AD).

In a high-powered study (N = 895), we tested direct and indirect effects of boredom and self-control on adherence. The results showed that both traits were important predictors of adherence but the underlying mechanisms differed. Specifically, individuals high in boredom perceived social distancing as more difficult, which in turn reduced their adherence (i.e., a mediated effect). In contrast, individuals high in self-control adhered more to the guidelines without perceiving them as more or less difficult; however, self-control moderated the effect of difficulty on adherence.

18467,The professional and personal impact of the coronavirus pandemic on US neurointerventional practices: a nationwide survey,"BACKGROUND: Little is currently known about the effects of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic on neurointerventional (NI) procedural volumes or its toll on physician wellness. METHODS: A 37-question online survey was designed and distributed to physician members of three NI physician organizations. RESULTS: A total of 151 individual survey responses were obtained. Reduced mechanical thrombectomy procedures compared with pre-pandemic were observed with 32% reporting a greater than 50% reduction in thrombectomy volumes. In concert with most (76%) reporting at least a 25% reduction in non-mechanical thrombectomy urgent NI procedures and a nearly unanimous (96%) cessation of non-urgent elective cases, 68% of physicians reported dramatic reductions (>50%) in overall NI procedural volume compared with pre-pandemic. Increased door-to-puncture times were reported by 79%. COVID-19-positive infections occurred in 1% of physician respondents: an additional 8% quarantined for suspected infection. Sixty-six percent of respondents reported increased career stress, 56% increased personal life/family stress, and 35% increased career burnout.

16399,SARS-CoV-2 antibody prevalence in Brazil: results from two successive nationwide serological household surveys,"BACKGROUND: Population-based data on COVID-19 are essential for guiding policies. There are few such studies, particularly from low or middle-income countries. Brazil is currently a hotspot for COVID-19 globally. We aimed to investigate severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibody prevalence by city and according to sex, age, ethnicity group, and socioeconomic status, and compare seroprevalence estimates with official statistics on deaths and cases. METHODS: In this repeated cross-sectional study, we did two seroprevalence surveys in 133 sentinel cities in all Brazilian states. We randomly selected households and randomly selected one individual from all household members. We excluded children younger than 1 year. Presence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 was assessed using a lateral flow point-of-care test, the WONDFO SARS-CoV-2 Antibody Test (Wondfo Biotech, Guangzhou, China), using two drops of blood from finger prick samples. This lateral-flow assay detects IgG and IgM isotypes that are specific to the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain of the spike protein. Participants also answered short questionnaires on sociodemographic information (sex, age, education, ethnicity, household size, and household assets) and compliance with physical distancing measures. FINDINGS: We included 25 025 participants in the first survey (May 14-21) and 31 165 in the second (June 4-7). For the 83 (62%) cities with sample sizes of more than 200 participants in both surveys, the pooled seroprevalence increased from 1.9% (95% CI 1.7-2.1) to 3.1% (2.8-3.4). City-level prevalence ranged from 0% to 25.4% in both surveys. 11 (69%) of 16 cities with prevalence above 2.0% in the first survey were located in a stretch along a 2000 km of the Amazon river in the northern region. In the second survey, we found 34 cities with prevalence above 2.0%, which included the same 11 Amazon cities plus 14 from the northeast region, where prevalence was increasing rapidly. Prevalence levels were lower in the south and centre-west, and intermediate in the southeast, where the highest level was found in Rio de Janeiro (7.5% [4.2-12.2]). In the second survey, prevalence was similar in men and women, but an increased prevalence was observed in participants aged 20-59 years and those living in crowded conditions (4.4% [3.5-5.6] for those living with households with six or more people). Prevalence among Indigenous people was 6.4% (4.1-9.4) compared with 1.4% (1.2-1.7) among White people. Prevalence in the poorest socioeconomic quintile was 3.7% (3.2-4.3) compared with 1.7% (1.4-2.2) in the wealthiest quintile. INTERPRETATION: Antibody prevalence was highly heterogeneous by country region, with rapid initial escalation in Brazil's north and northeast. Prevalence is strongly associated with Indigenous ancestry and low socioeconomic status. These population subgroups are unlikely to be protected if the policy response to the pandemic by the national government continues to downplay scientific evidence.

37908,Death-associated protein kinase 1 has a critical role in aberrant tau protein regulation and function.,The presence of tangles composed of phosphorylated tau is one of the neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Tau  a microtubule (MT)-associated protein  accumulates in AD potentially as a result of posttranslational modifications  such as hyperphosphorylation and conformational changes. However  it has not been fully understood how tau accumulation and phosphorylation are deregulated. In the present study  we identified a novel role of death-associated protein kinase 1 (DAPK1) in the regulation of the tau protein. We found that hippocampal DAPK1 expression is markedly increased in the brains of AD patients compared with age-matched normal subjects. DAPK1 overexpression increased tau protein stability and phosphorylation at multiple AD-related sites. In contrast  inhibition of DAPK1 by overexpression of a DAPK1 kinase-deficient mutant or by genetic knockout significantly decreased tau protein stability and abolished its phosphorylation in cell cultures and in mice. Mechanistically  DAPK1-enhanced tau protein stability was mediated by Ser71 phosphorylation of Pin1  a prolyl isomerase known to regulate tau protein stability  phosphorylation  and tau-related pathologies. In addition  inhibition of DAPK1 kinase activity significantly increased the assembly of MTs and accelerated nerve growth factor-mediated neurite outgrowth. Given that DAPK1 has been genetically linked to late onset AD  these results suggest that DAPK1 is a novel regulator of tau protein abundance  and that DAPK1 upregulation might contribute to tau-related pathologies in AD. Therefore  we offer that DAPK1 might be a novel therapeutic target for treating human AD and other tau-related pathologies.,0,Death-associated protein kinase 1 has a critical role in aberrant tau protein regulation and function.The presence of tangles composed of phosphorylated tau is one of the neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD).

In contrast  inhibition of DAPK1 by overexpression of a DAPK1 kinase-deficient mutant or by genetic knockout significantly decreased tau protein stability and abolished its phosphorylation in cell cultures and in mice. Mechanistically  DAPK1-enhanced tau protein stability was mediated by Ser71 phosphorylation of Pin1  a prolyl isomerase known to regulate tau protein stability  phosphorylation  and tau-related pathologies. In addition  inhibition of DAPK1 kinase activity significantly increased the assembly of MTs and accelerated nerve growth factor-mediated neurite outgrowth. Given that DAPK1 has been genetically linked to late onset AD  these results suggest that DAPK1 is a novel regulator of tau protein abundance  and that DAPK1 upregulation might contribute to tau-related pathologies in AD. Therefore  we offer that DAPK1 might be a novel therapeutic target for treating human AD and other tau-related pathologies.,"{'judgement': 'False', 'index': 268}",0,"{'judgement': 'False', 'index': 268}",0,"{'judgement': 'False', 'index': 268}",0,"{'judgement': '', 'probability': '', 'index': 268}",,"{'judgement': 'False', 'index': 268}",0

[Chinese],"Objective: To investigate the mechanism of sovereign medicines in Sanren Decoction on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) through network pharmacology and molecular docking methods. Method(s): The main active ingredients of sovereign medicines in Sanren Decoction (Armeniacae Semen Amarum, Amomun kravanh Pierre ex Gagnep, and Coicis Semen) were obtained and screened from by TCMSP and TCMID V2.0, combined with related research. Using UniPort database to query the target proteins corresponding to the active ingredients, then a component-target network was constructed by Cytoscape 3.7.2. PPI network was constructed through the STRING website, and cytoHubba was used to analysis the key subnetworks. CTD database was used to analyze GO and KEGG enrichment of the active ingredient target proteins of Sanren Decoction. Using the active ingredients of sovereign medicines in Sanren Decoction and related chemical drugs such as lopinavir as ligands, molecular docking with the SARS-CoV-2 3CL hydrolase was performed through the CB-Dock website. Result(s): Sovereign medicines in Sanren Decoction had 39 active ingredients, corresponding to 168 target proteins. The GO enrichment analysis obtained 25 biological processes (BP) items, 14 related items of cell composition (CC), and two molecular function (MF) item, respectively. KEGG enrichment screened 36 signaling pathways such as innate immune system, cytokine signaling in immune system, signaling by interleukins. The molecular docking results suggested that the active ingredients of mairin, ziziphin_qt, and oleanolic acid of sovereign medicines in Sanren Decoction had good binding energy with SARS-CoV-2 3CL hydrolase, and the Vina score of them were similar to those of lopinavir (the 3CLpro inhibitor) and remdesivir (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitor).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A rat glioma cell line (C6) was incubated with C-14 choline; the time course of uptake and metabolism was determined in vitro. C-11 choline was injected intravenously in tumor-bearing rats; the time course of distribution in organs was determined. C-11 choline also was injected intravenously in 20 patients (aged 6-86 years) with brain tumors and two volunteers (aged 38 and 58 years); distribution of the tracer in the brain was determined. Regional cerebral blood flow was measured by using oxygen-15 water on the same day. RESULTS: C-14 choline was metabolized to phosphoryl choline in glioma cells. The uptake of C-11 choline by glioblastoma cells was three to four times higher than that in the rat brain. All brain tumors took up more C-11 choline than did normal brain; thus  brain tumors that were not treated  as well as those that were treated with surgery or radiation therapy  were depicted. The tumor-normal brain uptake ratio of C-11 choline in brain tumor did not correlate with the O-15 water regional blood flow in the corresponding area.

RESULTS: All participants finished the test meal and tolerated the procedure well. All gastric emptying parameters were not significantly affected by age or gender. Values above the 95th percentile of T1/2   gastric retention at 1  2  and 3 h (85 min  65%  28%  and 8%  respectively) were indicative of delayed gastric emptying. Values below the 5th percentile of gastric retention at 0.5 and 1jv (40% and 15%  respectively) were indicative of rapid gastric emptying. The lower gastric retention limit at 0.5 and 1jv were 40% and 15%  respectively. Four (13.3%) diabetes and four (13.3%) functional dyspepsia patients had delayed emptying while three diabetes patients (10%) had rapid emptying. Gastric emptying parameters correlated best with vomiting (rjv=E0.621) and nausea (rE=E,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 278}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 278}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 278}",1,"{'judgement': 'False', 'index': 278}",0,"{'judgement': 'False', 'index': 278}",0
56224,Mitochondrial Abeta: a potential focal point for neuronal metabolic dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease.,Although amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) is the neurotoxic species implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD)  mechanisms through which intracellular Abeta impairs cellular properties  resulting in neuronal dysfunction  remain to be clarified. Here we demonstrate that intracellular Abeta is present in mitochondria from brains of transgenic mice with targeted neuronal overexpression of mutant human amyloid precursor protein and AD patients. Abeta progressively accumulates in mitochondria and is associated with diminished enzymatic activity of respiratory chain complexes (III and IV) and a reduction in the rate of oxygen consumption. Importantly  mitochondria-associated Abeta  principally Abeta42  was detected as early as 4 months  before extensive extracellular Abeta deposits. Our studies delineate a new means through which Abeta potentially impairs neuronal energetics  contributing to cellular dysfunction in AD.,0,Mitochondrial Abeta: a potential focal point for neuronal metabolic dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease.Although amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) is the neurotoxic species implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD)  mechanisms through which intracellular Abeta impairs cellular properties  resulting in neuronal dysfunction  remain to be clarified.

Conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic, this study (n = 310) tested whether past and current engagement with thematically relevant media fictions, including horror and pandemic films, was associated with greater preparedness for and psychological resilience toward the pandemic. Since morbid curiosity has previously been associated with horror media use during the COVID-19 pandemic, we also tested whether trait morbid curiosity was associated with pandemic preparedness and psychological resilience during the COVID-19 pandemic. We found that fans of horror films exhibited greater resilience during the pandemic and that fans of ""prepper"" genres (alien-invasion, apocalyptic, and zombie films) exhibited both greater resilience and preparedness. We also found that trait morbid curiosity was associated with positive resilience and interest in pandemic films during the pandemic.

Statins  which are used clinically for reducing cholesterol levels  can also exert beneficial vascular actions. Thus  we examined the protective effects of statins on NVU disturbances in a mouse AD model. Amyloid precursor protein (APP) transgenic (Tg) mice were used as a model of AD. Atorvastatin (30 mg/kg/day  p.o.) or pitavastatin (3 mg/kg/day  p.o.) were administered from 5 to 20 months of age. Changes in the NVU  including the endothelium and basement membrane  as well as astrogliosis and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) activation  were assessed. There was a reduction in immunopositive staining for N-acetyl glucosamine oligomer (NAGO) in the endothelium and in collagen IV in the APP vehicle (APP/Ve) group  with collagen IV staining most weakest near senile plaques (SPs). There was also an increase in intensity and number of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive astrocytes  particularly around the SP  where MMP-9 was more strongly labeled. Double immunofluorescent analysis showed that astrocytic endfeet had detached from the capillary endothelium in the APP/Ve group. Treatment with atorvastatin or pitavastatin ameliorated the activation of MMP-9.

16706,Transesophageal endoscopic ultrasound with fine needle aspiration in the preoperative staging of malignant pleural mesothelioma.,PURPOSE: Surgical resection as part of a multimodality approach in malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) has a high morbidity and mortality. Because mediastinal lymph node (MLN) metastases are a negative prognostic factor  preoperative staging is of paramount importance. Transesophageal endoscopic ultrasound with real-time guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) enables accurate MLN staging in lung cancer.  EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The feasibility and yield of EUS-FNA in MLN staging were prospectively analyzed in patients with presumed early-stage MPM considered for multimodality therapy. MLN reference pathology was defined by either pathologic staging or the formal demonstration of malignant cells by either EUS-FNA or mediastinoscopy.  RESULTS: Thirty-two consecutive patients (81% males; median age  61 years) with proven MPM underwent EUS-FNA. In 11 (34%) patients  a negative EUS-FNA or mediastinoscopy was not confirmed by surgical MLN dissection because of clinical deterioration or disease progression. In 21 (66%) patients  a formal pathology of the MLN was obtained and staging with EUS-FNA was positive in 4 (19%). Mediastinoscopy did not result in a greater yield of MLN metastasis as compared with EUS-FNA. Thoracotomy with complete lymph node dissection was done in 17 (81%). The overall prevalence of MLN metastasis was 24%  and the sensitivity of EUS-FNA was 80% (95% confidence interval  28-99%) with a specificity of 100% (95% confidence interval  79-100%). One patient had esophageal perforation related to EUS-FNA.  CONCLUSIONS: EUS-FNA is feasible and sensitive for MLN staging in patients with MPM who are candidate for multimodality treatment.

Patients were identified from our institutional database (Clinical Query 2). Demographics, baseline comorbidities, hospital stay, ICU stay, interventions and crude mortality are presented. RESULT(S): A total of 11 inpatients with SARS-CoV-2 and PTX were included (mean age 66.45 years [SD 13.28]; 81.82% [n=9] males; 72.73% PTX on the right side). The mean hospital stay until discharge or death was 25.91 days (SD 11.61), with a mean time from admission to PTX of 13.81 days (SD 12.27). Nine (81.82%) of PTX were secondary spontaneous and 2 (18.18%) iatrogenic. The most common comorbid conditions found were hypertension (54.55%) followed by hyperlipidemia (45.45%), malignancy (27.27%) and congestive heart failure (27.27%). Nine (81.81%) subjects were on the ICU when the event occurred with a mean ICU stay of 15.11 days (SD 8.89). Seven (63.64%) patients were under mechanical ventilation with a mean intubation time of 19.86 days (SD 10.17). Ten (90.91%) subjects required chest tube insertion with 54.54% (n=6) requiring chest tube size > 14 Fr. Two (18.18%) patients ended up having tracheostomy and 5 (45.45%) died before discharge. CONCLUSION(S): We found that secondary and iatrogenic PTX may be an infrequent complication of patients admitted for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2. This entity may be implicated in acute clinical deterioration with rapid oxygen desaturation in critically ill patients.

58614,Targeting phospho-Ser422 by active Tau Immunotherapy in the THYTau22 mouse model: a suitable therapeutic approach.,Recent data indicate that Tau immunotherapy may be relevant for interfering with neurofibrillary degeneration in Alzheimer disease and related disorders referred to as Tauopathies. The key question for immunotherapy is the choice of the epitope to target. Abnormal phosphorylation is a well-described post-translational modification of Tau proteins and may be a good target. In the present study  we investigated the effects of active immunization against the pathological epitope phospho-Ser422 in the THY-Tau22 transgenic mouse model. Starting from 3-6 months of age  THY-Tau22 mice develop hippocampal neurofibrillary tangle-like inclusions and exhibit phosphorylation of Tau on several AD-relevant Tau epitopes. Three month-old THY-Tau22 mice were immunized with a peptide including the phosphoserine 422 residue while control mice received the adjuvant alone. A specific antibody response against the phospho-Ser422 epitope was observed. We noticed a decrease in insoluble Tau species (AT100- and pS422 immunoreactive) by both biochemical and immunohistochemical means correlated with a significant cognitive improvement using the Y-maze. This Tau immunotherapy may facilitate Tau clearance from the brain toward the periphery since  following immunization  an increase in Tau concentrations was observed in blood. Overall  the present work is  to our knowledge  the first one to demonstrate that active immunotherapy targeting a real pathological epitope such as phospho-Ser422 epitope is efficient. This immunotherapy allows for Tau clearance and improves cognitive deficits promoted by Tau pathology in a well-defined Tau transgenic model.,0,Targeting phospho-Ser422 by active Tau Immunotherapy in the THYTau22 mouse model: a suitable therapeutic approach.Recent data indicate that Tau immunotherapy may be relevant for interfering with neurofibrillary degeneration in Alzheimer disease and related disorders referred to as Tauopathies.

There were twenty-six patients. Six reconstructions were intercalary  sixteen were resection arthrodeses  three followed resection of a bone segment including the epiphysis (osteoarticular reconstruction)  and one was a replacement of the entire humerus. Resection arthrodesis about the knee was performed with a smooth intramedullary rod and with one growth plate left intact. Six procedures were performed in the upper extremity. Excluding the patients who died  the average duration of follow-up was five years and three months. Twenty-one of the twenty-six patients had reached skeletal maturity at the time of follow-up. Eighteen (69 per cent) of the patients had a good or excellent result  four (15 per cent) had a fair result  and four had a failure. Twenty patients (77 per cent) had at least one complication (other than a limb-length discrepancy)  and fourteen (54 per cent) sustained at least one fracture of the allograft. Fifteen patients who had had a reconstruction in the lower extremity had survived with survival of the allograft at the time of the latest follow-up. A limb-length discrepancy of at least two centimeters developed in nine of the fifteen patients. Five were managed with a contralateral epiphyseodesis  and one of them had an unsuccessful attempt at limb-lengthening as well. The patients who had a limb-length discrepancy of more than three centimeters at the time of follow-up had been significantly younger (p < 0.05) at the time of the reconstruction than those who had a smaller discrepancy. Three allografts (12 per cent)  two of which were implanted early in the series  became infected. Soft-tissue coverage is of paramount importance for the prevention of infection  and we now routinely perform primary muscle (gastrocnemius or latissimus dorsi) transfers when dealing with an inadequate muscle envelope. Twelve patients were followed for more than four years (average  six years and seven months); they had no complications other than increased limb-length discrepancy and one subluxation of the shoulder after the first four years following the reconstruction.

4800,Enhanced glutathione PEGylated liposomal brain delivery of an anti-amyloid single domain antibody fragment in a mouse model for Alzheimer's disease.,Treatment of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease is hampered by the blood-brain barrier (BBB). This tight cerebral vascular endothelium regulates selective diffusion and active transport of endogenous molecules and xenobiotics into and out of the brain parenchyma. In this study  glutathione targeted PEGylated (GSH-PEG) liposomes were designed to deliver amyloid-targeting antibody fragments across the BBB into the brain. Two different formulations of GSH-PEG liposomes based on 1 2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DMPC) and egg-yolk phosphatidylcholine (EYPC) were produced. Both formulations encapsulate 15kDa amyloid beta binding llama single domain antibody fragments (VHH-pa2H). To follow the biodistribution of VHH-pa2H rather than the liposome  the antibody fragment was labeled with the radioisotope indium-111. To prolong the shelf life of the construct beyond the limit of radioactive decay  an active-loading method was developed to efficiently radiolabel the antibody fragments after encapsulation into the liposomes  with radiolabeling efficiencies of up to 68% after purification. The radiolabeled liposomes were administered via a single intravenous bolus injection to APPswe/PS1dE9 double transgenic mice  a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease  and their wildtype littermates. Both GSH-PEG DMPC and GSH-PEG EYPC liposomes significantly increased the standard uptake values (SUV) of VHH-pa2H in the blood of the animals compared to free VHH-pa2H. Encapsulation in GSH-PEG EYPC liposomes resulted in the highest increase in SUV in the brains of transgenic animals. Overall  these data provide evidence that GSH-PEG liposomes may be suitable for specific delivery of single domain antibody fragments over the BBB into the brain.,0,Enhanced glutathione PEGylated liposomal brain delivery of an anti-amyloid single domain antibody fragment in a mouse model for Alzheimer's disease.Treatment of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease is hampered by the blood-brain barrier (BBB).

Initial reports from the outbreak in Italy, China and the USA have provided anecdotal evidence of improved outcomes with the administration of anti-IL-6 agents, and large-scale trials evaluating these therapies are ongoing. STUDY DESCRIPTION: In this retrospective case series, clinical outcomes and correlates of response to treatment with the IL-6 receptor antagonist sarilumab are described for 15 patients with COVID-19 from a single institution in Southern Italy. Among 10 patients whose symptoms improved after sarilumab treatment, rapid decreases in CRP levels corresponded with clinical improvement. Lower levels of IL-6 at baseline as well as lower neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio as compared with patients whose COVID-19 did not improve with treatment were associated with sarilumab-responsive disease. CONCLUSIONS: This observation may reflect a possible clinical benefit regarding early intervention with IL-6-modulatory therapies for COVID-19 and that CRP could be a potential biomarker of response to treatment.

27724,Risk of SARS-CoV-2 Transmission During Flexible Laryngoscopy: A Systematic Review,"Importance: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) reportedly infected otolaryngologists disproportionately in the early parts of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Recommendations from national and international health organizations suggest minimizing the use of flexible laryngoscopy as a result. Objective: To review evidence on the risks of aerosolization and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from patients to health care personnel during endoscopy of the upper aerodigestive tract. Evidence Review: A comprehensive review of literature was performed on April 19, 2020, using the PubMed/MEDLINE (1966-April 2020), Embase (1975-April 2020), and Web of Science (1900-April 2020) databases. All English-language primary research studies were included if they assessed the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV-1 during procedures in the upper aerodigestive tract. The primary outcome measure was disease transmission among health care workers. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were used for accuracy of reporting. Findings: The queries for SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 identified 6 articles for systematic review. No studies included in this review provided data for SARS-CoV-2 transmission during flexible laryngoscopy. A total of 204 of 1264 health care workers (16.1%) had procedure-specific infections of SARS-CoV-1 or SARS-CoV-2. Among those, 53 of 221 (24.0%) were exposed during intubation, 1 of 15 (6.7%) during bronchoscopy, and 1 of 1 (100%) during endoscopy-assisted intubation. Conclusions and Relevance: A substantial lack of research precludes formal conclusions about the safety of flexible laryngoscopy and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from patients to health care workers. The use of appropriate precautionary measures and personal protective equipment appears to reduce the risk of transmission. Given the uncertainty in transmission and the known benefits of safety precautions, upper airway endoscopy may be reasonable to perform if precautionary steps are taken.",0,"Risk of SARS-CoV-2 Transmission During Flexible Laryngoscopy: A Systematic ReviewImportance: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) reportedly infected otolaryngologists disproportionately in the early parts of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.

Objective: To review evidence on the risks of aerosolization and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from patients to health care personnel during endoscopy of the upper aerodigestive tract. Evidence Review: A comprehensive review of literature was performed on April 19, 2020, using the PubMed/MEDLINE (1966-April 2020), Embase (1975-April 2020), and Web of Science (1900-April 2020) databases. All English-language primary research studies were included if they assessed the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV-1 during procedures in the upper aerodigestive tract. The primary outcome measure was disease transmission among health care workers. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were used for accuracy of reporting. Findings: The queries for SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 identified 6 articles for systematic review. No studies included in this review provided data for SARS-CoV-2 transmission during flexible laryngoscopy. A total of 204 of 1264 health care workers (16.1%) had procedure-specific infections of SARS-CoV-1 or SARS-CoV-2. Among those, 53 of 221 (24.0%) were exposed during intubation, 1 of 15 (6.7%) during bronchoscopy, and 1 of 1 (100%) during endoscopy-assisted intubation. Conclusions and Relevance: A substantial lack of research precludes formal conclusions about the safety of flexible laryngoscopy and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from patients to health care workers. The use of appropriate precautionary measures and personal protective equipment appears to reduce the risk of transmission. Given the uncertainty in transmission and the known benefits of safety precautions, upper airway endoscopy may be reasonable to perform if precautionary steps are taken.","{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 301}",1,"{'judgement': 'False', 'index': 301}",0,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 301}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'probability': '1', 'index': 301}",1,"{'judgement': 'False', 'index': 301}",0

7256,Brain correlates of musical and facial emotion recognition: evidence from the dementias.,The recognition of facial expressions of emotion is impaired in semantic dementia (SD) and is associated with right-sided brain atrophy in areas known to be involved in emotion processing  notably the amygdala. Whether patients with SD also experience difficulty recognizing emotions conveyed by other media  such as music  is unclear. Prior studies have used excerpts of known music from classical or film repertoire but not unfamiliar melodies designed to convey distinct emotions. Patients with SD (n = 11)  Alzheimer's disease (n = 12) and healthy control participants (n = 20) underwent tests of emotion recognition in two modalities: unfamiliar musical tunes and unknown faces as well as volumetric MRI. Patients with SD were most impaired with the recognition of facial and musical emotions  particularly for negative emotions. Voxel-based morphometry showed that the labelling of emotions  regardless of modality  correlated with the degree of atrophy in the right temporal pole  amygdala and insula. The recognition of musical (but not facial) emotions was also associated with atrophy of the left anterior and inferior temporal lobe  which overlapped with regions correlating with standardized measures of verbal semantic memory. These findings highlight the common neural substrates supporting the processing of emotions by facial and musical stimuli but also indicate that the recognition of emotions from music draws upon brain regions that are associated with semantics in language.,0,Brain correlates of musical and facial emotion recognition: evidence from the dementias.The recognition of facial expressions of emotion is impaired in semantic dementia (SD) and is associated with right-sided brain atrophy in areas known to be involved in emotion processing  notably the amygdala.

The ICP measurement defined the need for a shunt. All 51 patients were re-examined three and twelve months later. The final follow-up was accomplished five years postoperatively. FINDINGS: 25 of the patients needed a shunt operation. One year after a shunt placement 72% of these patients had a good recovery concerning activities of daily living  58% benefited in their urinary incontinence and 57% walked better. During the 5 years of follow-up 8 patients with shunt and 9 without shunt had died. Positive effect of shunting remained. Only one neuropsychological test  recognition of words test  distinguishes the patients with the need for a shunt. Simple mini mental examination test was not different in those who improved.

61827,Quantitative kinetics of [124I]FIAU in cat and man,For the assessment of the efficacy of clinical gene therapy trials  different imaging modalities have been developed that enable a noninvasive assessment of location  magnitude  and duration of transduced gene expression in vivo. These imaging methods rely on a combination of an appropriate marker gene and a radiolabeled or paramagnetic marker substrate that can be detected by PET or MRI. Here  we assess whether the nucleoside analog 2'-fluoro-2'-deoxy-1beta-D-arabinofuranosyl-5-iodouracil (FIAU)  a specific marker substrate for herpes simplex virus type 1 thymidine kinase (HSV-1-tk) gene expression  penetrates the blood-brain barrier (BBB) as an essential prerequisite for a noninvasive assessment of HSV-1-tk gene expression in gliomas. METHODS: No-carrier-added [(124)I]FIAU was synthesized by reacting the precursor 2'-fluoro-2'-deoxy-1beta-D-arabinofuranosyluracil (FAU) with carrier-free [(124)I]NaI. The course of biodistribution of [(124)I]FIAU was investigated in anesthetized cats (n = 3; organs) and in one patient with a recurrent glioblastoma (plasma and brain) by PET imaging over several hours (cats  1-22 h) to several days (patient  1-68 h). FIAU PET was performed in conjunction with multitracer PET imaging (cerebral blood flow and cerebral metabolic rate of O(2) in cats only; cerebral metabolic rate of glucose and [(11)C]methionine in all subjects). A region-of-interest analysis was performed on the basis of coregistered high-resolution MR images. The average radioactivity concentration was determined  decay corrected  and recalculated as percentage injected dose per gram of tissue (%ID/g) or as standardized uptake values (SUVs). RESULTS: The average chemical yield of [(124)I]FIAU synthesis was 54.6% +/- 6.8%. The chemical and radiochemical purities of [(124)I]FIAU were found to be >98% and >95%  respectively. In cats  the kinetic analysis of [(124)I]FIAU-derived radioactivity showed an early peak (1-2 min after injection) in heart and kidneys (0.20 %ID/g; SUV  4.0) followed by a second peak (10-20 min after injection) in liver and spleen (0.16 %ID/g; SUV  3.2) with subsequent clearance from tissues and a late peak in the bladder (10-15 h after injection). In the unlesioned cat brain  no substantial [(124)I]FIAU uptake occurred throughout the measurement (<0.02 %ID/g; SUV  <0.4). In the patient  [(124)I]FIAU uptake in normal brain was also very low (<0.0002 %ID/g; SUV  <0.16). In contrast  the recurrent glioblastoma revealed relatively high levels of [(124)I]FIAU-derived radioactivity (5-10 min after injection; 0.001 %ID/g; SUV  0.8)  which cleared slowly over the 68-h imaging period. CONCLUSION: The PET marker substrate FIAU does not penetrate the intact BBB significantly and  hence  is not the marker substrate of choice for the noninvasive localization of HSV-1-tk gene expression in the central nervous system under conditions in which the BBB is likely to be intact. However  substantial levels of [(124)I]FIAU-derived radioactivity may occur within areas of BBB disruption (e.g.  glioblastoma)  which is an essential prerequisite for imaging clinically relevant levels of HSV-1-tk gene expression in brain tumors after gene therapy by FIAU PET. For this purpose  washout of nonspecific radioactivity should be allowed for several days,0,Quantitative kinetics of [124I]FIAU in cat and manFor the assessment of the efficacy of clinical gene therapy trials  different imaging modalities have been developed that enable a noninvasive assessment of location  magnitude  and duration of transduced gene expression in vivo.

Here  we assess whether the nucleoside analog 2'-fluoro-2'-deoxy-1beta-D-arabinofuranosyl-5-iodouracil (FIAU)  a specific marker substrate for herpes simplex virus type 1 thymidine kinase (HSV-1-tk) gene expression  penetrates the blood-brain barrier (BBB) as an essential prerequisite for a noninvasive assessment of HSV-1-tk gene expression in gliomas. METHODS: No-carrier-added [(124)I]FIAU was synthesized by reacting the precursor 2'-fluoro-2'-deoxy-1beta-D-arabinofuranosyluracil (FAU) with carrier-free [(124)I]NaI. The course of biodistribution of [(124)I]FIAU was investigated in anesthetized cats (n = 3; organs) and in one patient with a recurrent glioblastoma (plasma and brain) by PET imaging over several hours (cats  1-22 h) to several days (patient  1-68 h). FIAU PET was performed in conjunction with multitracer PET imaging (cerebral blood flow and cerebral metabolic rate of O(2) in cats only; cerebral metabolic rate of glucose and [(11)C]methionine in all subjects). A region-of-interest analysis was performed on the basis of coregistered high-resolution MR images. The average radioactivity concentration was determined  decay corrected  and recalculated as percentage injected dose per gram of tissue (%ID/g) or as standardized uptake values (SUVs). RESULTS: The average chemical yield of [(124)I]FIAU synthesis was 54.6% +/- 6.8%. The chemical and radiochemical purities of [(124)I]FIAU were found to be >98% and >95%  respectively. In cats  the kinetic analysis of [(124)I]FIAU-derived radioactivity showed an early peak (1-2 min after injection) in heart and kidneys (0.20 %ID/g; SUV  4.0) followed by a second peak (10-20 min after injection) in liver and spleen (0.16 %ID/g; SUV  3.2) with subsequent clearance from tissues and a late peak in the bladder (10-15 h after injection). In the unlesioned cat brain  no substantial [(124)I]FIAU uptake occurred throughout the measurement (<0.02 %ID/g; SUV  <0.4). In the patient  [(124)I]FIAU uptake in normal brain was also very low (<0.0002 %ID/g; SUV  <0.16). In contrast  the recurrent glioblastoma revealed relatively high levels of [(124)I]FIAU-derived radioactivity (5-10 min after injection; 0.001 %ID/g; SUV  0.8)  which cleared slowly over the 68-h imaging period. CONCLUSION: The PET marker substrate FIAU does not penetrate the intact BBB significantly and  hence  is not the marker substrate of choice for the noninvasive localization of HSV-1-tk gene expression in the central nervous system under conditions in which the BBB is likely to be intact. However  substantial levels of [(124)I]FIAU-derived radioactivity may occur within areas of BBB disruption (e.g.  glioblastoma)  which is an essential prerequisite for imaging clinically relevant levels of HSV-1-tk gene expression in brain tumors after gene therapy by FIAU PET. For this purpose  washout of nonspecific radioactivity should be allowed for several days,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 313}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 313}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 313}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 313}",1,"{'judgement': 'False', 'index': 313}",0

60126,Cystatin C as a potential cerebrospinal fluid marker for the diagnosis of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.,The definite diagnosis of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD)  the most common form of human prion diseases  relies upon neuropathological data usually obtained at autopsy. In living patients  the diagnosis  based on suggestive clinical features and EEG abnormalities  can be aided by the detection of altered levels of isoforms of the 14-3-3 protein in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). However  the validity of this test has been recently challenged and the search for other  more reliable biomarkers for CJD remains highly desirable. The present study describes the identification of a new potential surrogate marker in the CSF of CJD-affected patients. A preliminary study employing surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization-time of flight (SELDI-TOF) technology highlighted a protein at 13.4 kDa in a small group (n = 8) of CJD-affected patients. Further analysis aimed at identifying this protein using cationic exchange chromatography  sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE)  and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) revealed it to be cystatin C. Additional immunoblot assays confirmed that the level of cystatin C was significantly increased (p </= 0.05) in all tested samples (n = 8). We conclude that the analysis of cystatin C levels in CSF could be useful as a pre-mortem indicator of the disease.,0,Cystatin C as a potential cerebrospinal fluid marker for the diagnosis of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.The definite diagnosis of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD)  the most common form of human prion diseases  relies upon neuropathological data usually obtained at autopsy.

RESULTS: African Americans had more advanced diabetes  as indicated by fasting blood glucose levels  anti-diabetes medication use  and cardiovascular risk profiles. African Americans with prevalent diabetes experienced 41% greater annual decline in processing speed scores (p = 0.048) and 50% greater annual decline in verbal fluency scores (p = 0.042) than those without diabetes; incident diabetes was not associated with cognitive decline.

6647,Nucleation of protein fibrillation by nanoparticles.,Nanoparticles present enormous surface areas and are found to enhance the rate of protein fibrillation by decreasing the lag time for nucleation. Protein fibrillation is involved in many human diseases  including Alzheimer's  Creutzfeld-Jacob disease  and dialysis-related amyloidosis. Fibril formation occurs by nucleation-dependent kinetics  wherein formation of a critical nucleus is the key rate-determining step  after which fibrillation proceeds rapidly. We show that nanoparticles (copolymer particles  cerium oxide particles  quantum dots  and carbon nanotubes) enhance the probability of appearance of a critical nucleus for nucleation of protein fibrils from human beta(2)-microglobulin. The observed shorter lag (nucleation) phase depends on the amount and nature of particle surface. There is an exchange of protein between solution and nanoparticle surface  and beta(2)-microglobulin forms multiple layers on the particle surface  providing a locally increased protein concentration promoting oligomer formation. This and the shortened lag phase suggest a mechanism involving surface-assisted nucleation that may increase the risk for toxic cluster and amyloid formation. It also opens the door to new routes for the controlled self-assembly of proteins and peptides into novel nanomaterials.,0,Nucleation of protein fibrillation by nanoparticles.Nanoparticles present enormous surface areas and are found to enhance the rate of protein fibrillation by decreasing the lag time for nucleation.

DESIGN: Multicentre, open label, randomised controlled trial. SETTING: 16 government designated covid-19 treatment centres in China, 11 to 29 February 2020. PARTICIPANTS: 150 patients admitted to hospital with laboratory confirmed covid-19 were included in the intention to treat analysis (75 patients assigned to hydroxychloroquine plus standard of care, 75 to standard of care alone). INTERVENTIONS: Hydroxychloroquine administrated at a loading dose of 1200 mg daily for three days followed by a maintenance dose of 800 mg daily (total treatment duration: two or three weeks for patients with mild to moderate or severe disease, respectively). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Negative conversion of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 by 28 days, analysed according to the intention to treat principle. Adverse events were analysed in the safety population in which hydroxychloroquine recipients were participants who received at least one dose of hydroxychloroquine and hydroxychloroquine non-recipients were those managed with standard of care alone. RESULTS: Of 150 patients, 148 had mild to moderate disease and two had severe disease. The mean duration from symptom onset to randomisation was 16.6 (SD 10.5; range 3-41) days.

41036,COVID-19-related web search behaviors and infodemic attitudes in Italy: Infodemiological study,"Background: Since the beginning of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, fake news and misleading information have circulated worldwide, which can profoundly affect public health communication. Objective(s): We investigated online search behavior related to the COVID-19 outbreak and the attitudes of ""infodemic monikers"" (ie, erroneous information that gives rise to interpretative mistakes, fake news, episodes of racism, etc) circulating in Italy. Method(s): By using Google Trends to explore the internet search activity related to COVID-19 from January to March 2020, article titles from the most read newspapers and government websites were mined to investigate the attitudes of infodemic monikers circulating across various regions and cities in Italy.

In this study, an attempt was made to document the genome-wide codon usage profile and the various factors influencing the codon usage patterns of SARS-CoV-2 in human and dog. The SARS-CoV-2 genome showed relative abundance of A and U nucleotides and relative synonymous codon usage analysis revealed that the preferred synonymous codons mostly end with A/U.

6965,Effects of COVID-19 lockdown on global air quality and health,"The COVID-19 pandemic has put much of the world into lockdown, as one unintended upside to this response, the air quality has been widely reported to have improved worldwide. Existing studies examine the environmental effect of lockdowns at a city- or country-level, few examines it from a global perspective. Using a novel COVID-19 government response tracker dataset, combining the daily air pollution data and weather data across 597 major cities worldwide between January 1, 2020, and July 5, 2020, this study quantifies the causal impacts of 8 types of lockdown measures on changes of a range of individual pollutants based on a difference-in-differences design. The results show that the NO2 air quality index value falls more precipitously (23-37%) relative to the pre-lockdown period, followed by PM10 (14-20%), SO2 (2-20%), PM2.5 (7-16%), and CO (7-11%), but the O3 increases 10-27%. Furthermore, intra/intercity travel restrictions have a better performance in curbing air pollution. These results are robust to a set of alternative specifications, including different panel sizes, independent variables, estimation strategies. The heterogeneity analysis in terms of different types of cities shows that the lockdown effects are more remarkable in cities from lower-income, more industrialized, and populous countries. We also do a back-of-the-envelope calculation of the subsequent health benefits following such improvement, and the expected averted premature deaths due to air pollution declines are around 99,270 to 146,649 among 76 countries and regions involved in this study during the COVID-19 lockdown. These findings underscore the importance of continuous air pollution control strategies to protect human health and reduce the associated social welfare loss both during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.

53769,"Pathophysiology, Transmission, Diagnosis, and Treatment of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): A Review","Importance: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, due to the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has caused a worldwide sudden and substantial increase in hospitalizations for pneumonia with multiorgan disease. This review discusses current evidence regarding the pathophysiology, transmission, diagnosis, and management of COVID-19. Observations: SARS-CoV-2 is spread primarily via respiratory droplets during close face-to-face contact. Infection can be spread by asymptomatic, presymptomatic, and symptomatic carriers. The average time from exposure to symptom onset is 5 days, and 97.5% of people who develop symptoms do so within 11.5 days. The most common symptoms are fever, dry cough, and shortness of breath. Radiographic and laboratory abnormalities, such as lymphopenia and elevated lactate dehydrogenase, are common, but nonspecific. Diagnosis is made by detection of SARS-CoV-2 via reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction testing, although false-negative test results may occur in up to 20% to 67% of patients; however, this is dependent on the quality and timing of testing. Manifestations of COVID-19 include asymptomatic carriers and fulminant disease characterized by sepsis and acute respiratory failure. Approximately 5% of patients with COVID-19, and 20% of those hospitalized, experience severe symptoms necessitating intensive care. More than 75% of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 require supplemental oxygen. Treatment for individuals with COVID-19 includes best practices for supportive management of acute hypoxic respiratory failure. Emerging data indicate that dexamethasone therapy reduces 28-day mortality in patients requiring supplemental oxygen compared with usual care (21.6% vs 24.6%; age-adjusted rate ratio, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.74-0.92]) and that remdesivir improves time to recovery (hospital discharge or no supplemental oxygen requirement) from 15 to 11 days. In a randomized trial of 103 patients with COVID-19, convalescent plasma did not shorten time to recovery. Ongoing trials are testing antiviral therapies, immune modulators, and anticoagulants. The case-fatality rate for COVID-19 varies markedly by age, ranging from 0.3 deaths per 1000 cases among patients aged 5 to 17 years to 304.9 deaths per 1000 cases among patients aged 85 years or older in the US. Among patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit, the case fatality is up to 40%. At least 120 SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are under development. Until an effective vaccine is available, the primary methods to reduce spread are face masks, social distancing, and contact tracing. Monoclonal antibodies and hyperimmune globulin may provide additional preventive strategies. Conclusions and Relevance: As of July 1, 2020, more than 10 million people worldwide had been infected with SARS-CoV-2. Many aspects of transmission, infection, and treatment remain unclear. Advances in prevention and effective management of COVID-19 will require basic and clinical investigation and public health and clinical interventions.Copyright ÁE© 2020 American Medical Association.

Method(s): In this retrospective, single-center, study, we enrolled 16 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 admitted to the Affiliated Hospital of Shaoxing University between February 24 and January 25, 2020. Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological feature, and treatment data were all collected. Outcomes were followed up until March 16, 2020. Result(s): Among the 16 patients with COVID-19 infection, 11 patients (68.8%) had traveled or lived in Wuhan or surrounding areas, and 2 (12.5%) patients had exposure to patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection. The average age of the patients was 44.1 (16.5) years, and there were 10 women (62.5%) and 6 men (37.5%). More than half had chronic diseases [9 (56.3%)].

36326,Thallium imaging for brain tumors with results measured by a semiquantitative index and correlated with histopathology,BACKGROUND. The optimal management of patients with brain tumors requires knowledge of the tumor characteristics upon presentation and the discovery of recurrence after therapy. Thallium-201 (Tl-201) chloride has shown varying uptake in tumors  depending on their viability and the type and degree of malignancy. This study explores the diagnostic potential of thallium imaging in patients with brain tumors. METHODS. Forty-three Tl-201 single photon emission computed tomographic scintigrams were performed on 40 patients with intracranial neoplasms  nearly equally divided between patients with no prior treatment and patients who had prior treatment and were suspected to have recurrent tumor and/or radiation necrosis. A thallium tumor index was calculated as the ratio of counts for a region of interest drawn in the lesion area and its mirror image in normal brain tissue. A two-tailed Student's t test was performed to compare the thallium index and histopathologic findings. RESULTS. A value of 1.5 for the thallium tumor index allowed for the best correlation between the prediction of malignancy and the histopathologic results. In the pretreatment group  a thallium tumor index greater than 1.5 correlated with high grade malignancy  and less than 1.5 correlated with either a well differentiated astrocytoma or benign cyst. In the posttreatment group  a thallium tumor index greater than 1.5 correlated with recurrent and/or residual malignant tumor. CONCLUSIONS. For those patients undergoing initial evaluation  the thallium study can help in the differential diagnosis of an intracranial mass lesion and offers confirmation of results of biopsy. For those patients who already have received treatment  the study can be used to detect recurrent or residual tumor,0,Thallium imaging for brain tumors with results measured by a semiquantitative index and correlated with histopathologyBACKGROUND. The optimal management of patients with brain tumors requires knowledge of the tumor characteristics upon presentation and the discovery of recurrence after therapy. Thallium-201 (Tl-201) chloride has shown varying uptake in tumors  depending on their viability and the type and degree of malignancy. This study explores the diagnostic potential of thallium imaging in patients with brain tumors. METHODS.

17626,COVID-19 financial support to small businesses in Switzerland: evaluation and outlook,"We analyse small businesses' recourse to public support measures during the COVID-19 crisis using a survey of 1011 self-employed workers and small business owners in Switzerland. We find that ""objective"" measures of lockdown affectedness and economic structure explain fairly well how businesses availed of support measures to cover labour costs. Recourse to government-backed corona loans, however, appears to be driven to a larger extent by behavioural idiosyncrasies across firms. Specifically, previously indebted businesses took out corona loans more readily than those who had been debt-free before the pandemic. Since uptake is not well in line with firm fundamentals, we propose making loan repayments contingent on future profits. This will more effectively target and sustain businesses that are in trouble today but would be viable in the absence COVID-19.

Rationale according to our experience",Kummell's disease (KD) is a rare clinical entity and includes patients  who after a trivial trauma and an asymptomatic period  develop a progressive vertebral body collapse and a painful kyphosis. The main pathologic eliciting event still remains unclear. Vertebral body collapse can be the result of infection  malignant neoplasia or trauma. It may be difficult to distinguish among them  particularly in osteoporosis. To explain the time lag between initial trauma and vertebral collapse  the hypothesis of ischemic necrosis was suggested. Many authors considering KD as a case of mere vertebral osteonecrosis have wrongly reported cases of osteonecrosis without a spinal trauma  as KD. The fact that intravertebral vacuum cleft often coexists with vertebral osteonecrosis further added to confusion. Various imaging modalities including bone scan support the diagnosis of KD.

53302,Clinical outcomes of 201 neonates born to mothers with COVID-19: a systematic review,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical manifestations and outcomes of neonates born to women who had Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) during pregnancy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted on PubMed and Embase till April 15, 2020, by combining the terms (COVID-19, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2, Novel Coronavirus, 2019-nCov, Wuhan pneumonia) and (pregnancy, pregnant women, mother, fetus, neonate, newborn, infant). RESULTS: We included 16 case series and 12 case reports describing a total of 223 pregnant women and 201 infants. Four newborns born to mothers affected by COVID-19 were reported to have laboratory-confirmed Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection within 48 hours after birth. However, Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction tests of the breast milk, placenta, amniotic fluids, and cord blood and maternal vaginal secretions were all negative for SARS-CoV-2 in the reported cases. Fetal death was reported in two cases, and 48 of 185 newborns (25.9%) were born prematurely. Infants born small for gestational age and low birth weight (< 2,500 g) accounted for 8.3% and 15.6% of reported cases, respectively. Birth asphyxia and respiratory distress syndrome were observed in 1.8% and 6.4% of neonates, respectively. There was one neonatal death due to intractable gastric bleeding among the SARS-CoV-2-negative infants. CONCLUSIONS: Current evidence suggests that COVID-19 during pregnancy rarely affects fetal and neonatal mortality, but can be associated with adverse neonatal morbidities. Vertical transmission has not been observed in the majority of the reported cases. The infants born to mothers with COVID-19 are carefully monitored for accompanying complication, and quarantine of infected mothers is warranted.",0,"Clinical outcomes of 201 neonates born to mothers with COVID-19: a systematic reviewOBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical manifestations and outcomes of neonates born to women who had Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) during pregnancy.

42045,Diagnostic performance of low-dose rest/stress Tc-99m tetrofosmin myocardial perfusion SPECT using the 530c CZT camera: quantitative vs visual analysis.,BACKGROUND: We set out to develop normal databases and prospectively validate abnormality criteria for a low-dose Tc-99m tetrofosmin myocardial perfusion SPECT protocol using the 530c CZT camera. METHODS: All patients received 6 mCi rest/20 mCi stress doses of Tc-99m tetrofosmin. Rest and stress images were obtained over 7-9 and 5-7 minutes according to the chest size. Low-dose CT of the chest was obtained on a standalone CT scanner. Forty patients with very low likelihood (LLK) of coronary artery disease (CAD) were used to define the normal count distributions. The abnormality criteria were prospectively validated in 55 patients who had coronary angiography and in 40 patients with LLK of CAD. RESULTS: The results for quantitative non-attenuation-corrected (AC) and AC analysis and visual analysis were as follows: sensitivity of 79%  85%  and 92% (P = NS) and specificity of 44%  75%  and 56% (P = NS)  respectively.

30863,Structure and neurotoxicity of novel amyloids derived from the BRI gene.,A number of human neurodegenerative diseases involve aggregated amyloid proteins in the brain  e.g. Alzheimer's disease (beta-amyloid) and Parkinson's disease (alpha-synuclein). Other examples are rare familial dementias which involve the BRI gene. In a British family  mutation of the termination codon extends the reading frame of BRI to yield a furin-processed 34-residue peptide (Abri; British dementia peptide)  11 residues longer than the wild-type (WT). In a Danish family  a ten-base insertion also yields a 34-residue peptide (Adan; Danish dementia peptide). To explore the roles of Abri and Adan in neurodegeneration  we synthesized Abri and Adan in oxidized and reduced forms and generated transgenic mice colonies expressing the WT and mutated forms of BRI. We have generated transgenic mice colonies bearing the genes coding for WT-BRI  Adan and Abri under the control of the Thy1 promoter.

24040,Clinical and High-Resolution CT Features of the COVID-19 Infection: Comparison of the Initial and Follow-up Changes,"OBJECTIVES: In late December, 2019, an outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China was caused by a novel coronavirus, newly named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We aimed to quantify severity of COVID-19 infection on High-Resolution CT and to determine its relationship with clinical parameters. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From Jan 11, 2020, to Feb 5, 2020, the clinical, laboratory and HRCT features of 42 patients (26-75 years, 25 males) with COVID-19 were analyzed. The initial and follow-up CT obtained a mean of 4.5 days and 11.6 days from the illness onset were retrospectively assessed for the severity and progression of pneumonia. Correlations among clinical parameters, initial CT features and progression of opacifications were evaluated with Spearman correlation and linear regression analysis. RESULTS: Thirty-five (83%) patients exhibited a progressive process according to CT features during the early stage from onset. Follow-up CT findings showed progressive opacifications, consolidation, interstitial thickening, fibrous strips and air bronchograms, compared to initial CT (all p<0.05). Before regular treatments, there was a moderate correlation between the days from onset and sum score of opacifications (R=0.68, p<0.01). The C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and lactate dehydrogenase showed significantly positive correlation with the severity of pneumonia assessed on initial CT (R range 0.36-0.75, p<0.05). The highest temperature and the severity of opacifications assessed on initial CT were significantly related to the progression of opacifications on follow-up CT (p=0.001-0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with the COVID-19 infection usually presented with typical ground-grass opacities and other CT features, which showed significant correlations with some clinical and laboratory measurements.

12454,Expression and distribution of carboxypeptidase B in the hippocampal subregions of normal and Alzheimer's disease brain.,Earlier neurochemical studies suggested that human brain carboxypeptidase B may play a significant role in the degradation of amyloid-beta1-42 in the brain. Using an immimohistochemical technique we report here on the neuronal expression and distribution of this enzyme in the segments (CA1a  CA1b and CA1c) of the CA1 subfield and in area CA4 of the hippocampus in normal and Alzheimer's disease brain samples. Its distribution was compared with the appearance of neurofibrillary tangles in the same brain sample. For immunohistochemical localization of carboxypeptidase B  a specific C14-module antibody was applied  together with the Gallyas silver impregnation technique for the demonstration of neurofibrillary tangles. The results revealed that  in the control samples  most of the immunoreactivity appeared in segment CA1a in the pyramidal cells  less in segment CA1b and least in segment CA1c. In the Alzheimer's disease samples  there was no particular immunostaining in the neurons  but  a large number of silver-impregnated degenerated neurons appeared. The results support the suggestion that carboxypeptidase B may play a significant role in elimination of the intracellular accumulation and toxicity of amyloid-beta in the human brain and thereby protect the neurons from degeneration.,0,Expression and distribution of carboxypeptidase B in the hippocampal subregions of normal and Alzheimer's disease brain.Earlier neurochemical studies suggested that human brain carboxypeptidase B may play a significant role in the degradation of amyloid-beta1-42 in the brain.

19626,Phospholipase D1 is associated with amyloid precursor protein in Alzheimer's disease.,Amyloid precursor protein (APP) is a widely expressed transmembrane protein of unknown function that is involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We investigated the involvement of phospholipase D (PLD) in the pathophysiology of AD. We showed dramatic upregulation of PLD1 immunoreactivity in reactive astroglial cells in brain tissue sections from authentic AD patients. Expression and activity of PLD1 were up-regulated in brain tissues from AD patients  especially caveolae membrane fraction  compared with those of control brains. Interestingly  PLD1 physically interacts and colocalizes with APP and caveolin-3. We found that APP was associated with the pleckstrin homology domain of PLD1  and the amyloid region of APP interacted with PLD. Elevated expression of APP stimulated PLD activity in human astroglioma cells. These results suggest that up-regulation of PLD might have a role in the neuronal pathology associated with AD.,0,Phospholipase D1 is associated with amyloid precursor protein in Alzheimer's disease.Amyloid precursor protein (APP) is a widely expressed transmembrane protein of unknown function that is involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD).

25191,The impact of COVID-19 infection on hip fractures 30-day mortality,"Introduction: A novel virus, SARS-CoV-2 has caused a fatal global pandemic which particularly affects the elderly and those with co-morbidities. Hip fractures affect elderly populations, necessitate hospital admissions, and place this group at particular risk from COVID-19 infection. This study investigates the effect of COVID-19 infection on 30-day hip fracture mortality. Method(s): Data related to seventy-five adult hip fractures admitted to two units during March and April 2020 was reviewed. The mean age was 83.5 years (range 65-98 years) and most (53, 70.7%) were females. The primary outcome measure was 30-day mortality associated with COVID-19 infection. Result(s): The COVID-19 infection rate was 26.7% (20 patients), with a significant difference in the 30-day mortality rate in COVID-19 positive group (10/20, 50%) compared to COVID-19 negative group (4/55, 7.3%), with mean time to death of 19.8 days (95% confidence interval 17.0-22.5). The mean time from admission to surgery was 43.1 hours and 38.3 hours, in COVID-19 positive and COVID-19 negative groups, respectively. All COVID-19 positive patients had shown symptoms of fever and cough, and all ten cases who died were from hypoxia. Seven (35%) cases had radiological lung findings consistent with viral pneumonitis which resulted in mortality (70% of mortality). 30% (n = 6) contracted the COVID-19 infection in the community and 70% (n = 14) developed symptoms after hospital admission. Conclusion(s): Hip fractures associated with COVID-19 infection have a high 30-day mortality. COVID-19 testing and chest x-ray for patients presenting with hip fractures, helps in early planning of high-risk surgeries and allows counselling of the patients and family using realistic prognosis.Copyright ÁE© The Author(s) 2020.",0,"The impact of COVID-19 infection on hip fractures 30-day mortalityIntroduction: A novel virus, SARS-CoV-2 has caused a fatal global pandemic which particularly affects the elderly and those with co-morbidities.

The precise mechanism by which aggregates are toxic remains unclear; however  these proteins have been shown to interact strongly with lipid membranes. We investigated morphological and mechanical changes in model lipid bilayers exposed to amyloid-forming proteins by reconstructing the tapping forces associated with atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging in solution. Tip/sample tapping forces contain information regarding mechanical properties of surfaces. Interpretation of the mechanical changes in the bilayers was aided by numerical simulations of the entire AFM experiment. Amyloid-forming proteins disrupted distinct regions of the bilayer morphology  and these regions were associated with decreased Young's modulus and adhesive properties. These changes in bilayer mechanical properties upon exposure to amyloid-forming proteins may represent a common mechanism leading to membrane dysfunction in amyloid diseases.,0,Amyloid-forming proteins alter the local mechanical properties of lipid membranes.A diverse number of diseases  including Alzheimer's disease  Huntington's disease  and type 2 diabetes  are characterized by the formation of fibrillar protein aggregates termed amyloids.

6159,Solution-phase parallel synthesis of carbamates as gamma-secretase inhibitors.,A novel methodology for parallel liquid-phase synthesis of carbamates suitable for the preparation of sterically hindered molecules is disclosed. The alcohols are converted to 4-nitrophenylcarbonates  followed by the reaction with amines. Side product 4-nitrophenol and the unreacted excess amines are scavenged by appropriately chosen cleanup resins  selected among Amberlyst A26 (hydroxide form) and macroporous sulfonic acid (MP-TsOH) or polystyrene isocyanate (PS-NCO) and polystyrene benzaldehyde (PS-PhCHO) resins. As a part of a medicinal chemistry program directed toward finding gamma-secretase inhibitors as prospective drug candidates for Alzheimer's disease  a 6 x 24 library of carbamates was prepared. Out of 144 library members  133 had a purity for the targeted compound of 80% or better. The prepared compounds were assessed in the gamma-secretase inhibition assay and demonstrated activity with IC 50 values in the range from 1 microM to 5 nM  with the activity of 7 compounds being better than 10 nM.,0,Solution-phase parallel synthesis of carbamates as gamma-secretase inhibitors.A novel methodology for parallel liquid-phase synthesis of carbamates suitable for the preparation of sterically hindered molecules is disclosed.

25861,Magnetic resonance imaging and epilepsy: neurosurgical decision making,Advances in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques have had an important impact on the decision-making process leading to surgical resection for chronic seizures. The MRI is now obtained relatively early in the work-up  and  when it shows abnormality  it assumes a crucial role in the detection of specific surgically remediable syndromes. These syndromes  when diagnosed by MR and other confirmatory studies such as electroencephalography (EEG)  positron emission tomography (PET)  magnetoencephalography (MEG)  and neuropsychological testing  define the essential part of the surgical plan; that is  removal of the disease substrate. The availability of a host of MR techniques enable us to investigate epilepsy not only as a structural pathology but as physiological pathology reflected in abnormal blood flow  metabolism  and synaptic transmission. The mainstay of surgical treatment is the removal of the anatomic pathology  but other MR techniques may be helpful in the delineation of dual pathology in lesional cases  in appreciation of the full extent of microscopic pathology in developmental lesions  and in the imposition of restrictions on the resection based upon functional mapping. Finally  functional and anatomic maps obtained preoperatively can be related directly to the spatial coordinates of the exposed brain in the operating room using MRI-based frameless stereotactic methods.

21888,Effect of delayed admission to the hospital on the preoperative prevalence of deep-vein thrombosis associated with fractures about the hip,Thirteen (10 per cent) of 133 patients who had venography on admission to the hospital for a fracture about the hip had radiographic evidence of deep-vein thrombosis. Only seven (6 per cent) of the 122 patients who were seen at the hospital within two days after the fracture had evidence of thrombosis. However  six of the eleven patients who had a delay of more than two days between the fracture and admission to the hospital had evidence of thrombosis. Although there was no significant difference between these two groups with respect to the mean age  sex distribution  frequency of fracture type  or history of deep-vein thrombosis  there was a significant difference in the prevalence of thrombosis in the patients who had a delay before admission to the hospital compared with those who did not (p<0.001). These results suggest that there is a substantial risk of venous thromboembolic disease in patients who have a fracture about the hip  regardless of whether or not they have had an operation  and that this risk increases if the time to presentation is delayed. Consequently  patients for whom there was a delay between a fracture about the hip and admission to the hospital should be considered to be at high risk for  and should be evaluated for  deep-vein thrombosis preoperatively.,0,Effect of delayed admission to the hospital on the preoperative prevalence of deep-vein thrombosis associated with fractures about the hipThirteen (10 per cent) of 133 patients who had venography on admission to the hospital for a fracture about the hip had radiographic evidence of deep-vein thrombosis.

40403,Rationale of 5-(125)I-iodo-4'-thio-2'-deoxyuridine as a potential iodinated proliferation marker,The aim of this investigation was to synthesize and test a novel metabolically stable iodinated nucleoside as a proliferation-imaging agent for SPECT. METHODS: 5-Iodo-4'-thio-2'-deoxyuridine (ITdU) and 5-iodo-1-(4-thio-beta-D-arabinofuranosyl)uracil (ITAU) were tested. The radiolabeling of ITdU and ITAU with (125)I was achieved by a destannylation reaction of the trimethylstannyl precursor of each nucleoside. The products were isolated in high yields and with >99% radiochemical purities. RESULTS: (125)I-ITdU was effectively phosphorylated by cytosolic nucleoside kinases and specifically incorporated into a thymidine kinase-expressing L-M cell rather than a thymidine kinase-deficient mutant L-M (TK(-)) cell. In addition  an in vitro cell metabolism study of (125)I-ITdU clarified that (125)I-ITdU was effectively and specifically incorporated into a DNA fraction (>90% at 60 min). Therefore  (125)I-ITdU was proven to be an ideal DNA synthesis marker such as 5-(125)I-iodo-2'-deoxyuridine (IUdR). In contrast  (125)I-ITAU was neither remarkably phosphorylated by cytosolic nucleoside kinases nor notably incorporated into an L-M cell rather than an L-M (TK(-)) cell. (125)I-ITdU and (125)I-ITAU showed a higher resistance to phosphorolytic cleavage by recombinant thymidine phosphorylase than did (125)I-IUdR. Furthermore  biodistribution of (125)I-ITdU and (125)I-ITAU revealed better in vivo stability of radioiodination than that of (125)I-IUdR. (125)I-ITdU also displayed a significantly higher uptake in proliferating organs (thymus  spleen  small intestine  and bone) than in nonproliferating organs (brain  muscle  liver  and lung)  as did (125)I-IUdR  at 18 h after injection. As indicated by the in vitro study  (125)I-ITAU did not show any significant uptake in proliferating organs.

54276,17 beta-estradiol alleviates synergistic oxidative stress resulting from folate deprivation and amyloid-beta treatment.,Oxidative stress is thought to be a pivotal factor in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Amyloid-beta (Abeta) induces oxidative damage  which is likely to be compounded by deficiencies in endogenous antioxidant capacity. Indeed  folate deprivation  which has been associated with AD  potentiates generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by Abeta. We examined whether the antioxidant 17-beta-estradiol could attenuate ROS generation following Abeta treatment in the presence and absence of folate using differentiated SH-SY-5Y human neuroblastoma cells. Folate-deprivation and Abeta treatment each induced an increase in ROS  and treatment of folate-deprived cultures with Abeta induced a synergistic increase in ROS. 17-beta-estradiol reduced ROS levels in beta-treated  folate-deprived cultures to ROS levels observed in cultures treated with Abeta in the presence of folate  suggesting that this antioxidant was able to prevent the synergistic impact of Abeta and folate deprivation on ROS generation. 17-beta-estradiol also completely prevented neuronal death induced by both Abeta and folate deprivation individually  and reduced neuronal death following Abeta treatment along with folate deprivation. These findings suggest that therapeutic approaches utilizing antioxidants may be particularly important in conditions such as AD  where multiple factors  including compromises in endogenous antioxidants  promote oxidative stress.,0,17 beta-estradiol alleviates synergistic oxidative stress resulting from folate deprivation and amyloid-beta treatment.Oxidative stress is thought to be a pivotal factor in Alzheimer's disease (AD).

65622,Implementing Virtual Simulated Person Methodology to Support the Shift to Online Learning: Technical Report,"The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically changed how education is delivered worldwide. The resultant rise of e-learning, whereby teaching is undertaken remotely and on digital platforms, has extensively impacted universities and other higher education organizations around the world. One approach to support this change in education delivery is the use of virtual simulation approaches. Our team at SimXSpace has piloted a virtual workshop using Zoom, an online video-conferencing platform, and virtual simulated persons (SPs) to support communication and interpersonal skills among learners. The main objective of the pilot virtual workshop was to develop and implement the SP methodology remotely via the Zoom platform (Zoom Video Communications, San Jose, California) and to evaluate its effectiveness as an immersive environment for simulation. The virtual workshop involved four instructors who intend to implement virtual SPs within their courses, two workshop facilitators, and two SPs. The workshop was conducted synchronously using Zoom features. The workshop followed a predefined structure and was completed as planned. Outcomes suggest that remote simulation delivery using virtual SPs and delivered online via Zoom is feasible and provides an effective environment in which to conduct SP methodology to teach communication and interpersonal skills. The findings suggest that remote simulation and virtual SPs can support experiential education and provide an effective and engaging learning environment. The virtual workshop was successful and laid a foundation for future online training programs for the use of SP methodology. Moreover, it formed an effective outline for subsequent iterations of this virtual training workshop and prompted discussion of plans for future workshops with various programs across a pan-university context.

5352,"Minocycline corrects early, pre-plaque neuroinflammation and inhibits BACE-1 in a transgenic model of Alzheimer's disease-like amyloid pathology.",BACKGROUND: A growing body of evidence indicates that inflammation is one of the earliest neuropathological events in Alzheimer's disease. Accordingly  we have recently shown the occurrence of an early  pro-inflammatory reaction in the hippocampus of young  three-month-old transgenic McGill-Thy1-APP mice in the absence of amyloid plaques but associated with intracellular accumulation of amyloid beta petide oligomers. The role of such a pro-inflammatory process in the progression of the pathology remained to be elucidated. METHODS AND RESULTS: To clarify this we administered minocycline  a tetracyclic derivative with anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties  to young  pre-plaque McGill-Thy1-APP mice for one month. The treatment ended at the age of three months  when the mice were still devoid of plaques. Minocycline treatment corrected the up-regulation of inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2 observed in young transgenic placebo mice. Furthermore  the down-regulation of inflammatory markers correlated with a reduction in amyloid precursor protein levels and amyloid precursor protein-related products. Beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 activity and levels were found to be up-regulated in transgenic placebo mice  while minocycline treatment restored these levels to normality. The anti-inflammatory and beta-secretase 1 effects could be partly explained by the inhibition of the nuclear factor kappa B pathway. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that the pharmacological modulation of neuroinflammation might represent a promising approach for preventing or delaying the development of Alzheimer's disease neuropathology at its initial  pre-clinical stages. The results open new vistas to the interplay between inflammation and amyloid pathology.,0,"Minocycline corrects early, pre-plaque neuroinflammation and inhibits BACE-1 in a transgenic model of Alzheimer's disease-like amyloid pathology.BACKGROUND: A growing body of evidence indicates that inflammation is one of the earliest neuropathological events in Alzheimer's disease.

The results open new vistas to the interplay between inflammation and amyloid pathology.","{'judgement': 'False', 'index': 357}",0,"{'judgement': 'False', 'index': 357}",0,"{'judgement': 'False', 'index': 357}",0,"{'judgement': 'True', 'probability': '0.8', 'index': 357}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 357}",1
2766,FDG-PET/CT findings highly suspicious for COVID-19 in an Italian case series of asymptomatic patients,"Aim: To illustrate the [18F]FDG-PET/CT findings in patients affected by cancer with clinical diagnosis of Covid-19 Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the cases of patients who showed pulmonary involvement unrelated to cancer metastases on March 13 and 16 2020. We reviewed the scans, collected medical history, and exposure information. Result(s): Among the 13 scans, we identified 5 cases with imaging findings suspicious for viral infection. Peripheral lung consolidations and/or ground-glass opacities in two or more lobes were found. Lung abnormalities displayed increased [18F]FDG uptake (SUVmax 4.3-11.3). All the patients on the day of PET/CT acquisition were asymptomatic, and they did not have fever or cough. In view of the PET/CT findings, home isolation, symptom surveillance, and treatment (in 3/5 patients) were indicated. At 1-week follow-up, 2/5 patients experienced the onset of mild respiratory symptoms. Conclusion(s): The [18F]FDG-PET/CT can identify probable Covid-19 disease in the absence or before symptoms onset and can guide patient management. Nuclear medicine staff needs to be aware of the possibility of contact with patients affected by the SARS-CoV-2 infection even if they do not present any symptom. Therefore, safety measures need to be adopted for other patients and hospital staff in order to block the spread of infection.Copyright ÁE© 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",0,"FDG-PET/CT findings highly suspicious for COVID-19 in an Italian case series of asymptomatic patientsAim: To illustrate the [18F]FDG-PET/CT findings in patients affected by cancer with clinical diagnosis of Covid-19 Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the cases of patients who showed pulmonary involvement unrelated to cancer metastases on March 13 and 16 2020.

18318,Ser-59 is the major phosphorylation site in alphaB-crystallin accumulated in the brains of patients with Alexander's disease.,The phosphorylation state of alphaB-crystallin accumulated in the brains of two patients with Alexander's disease (one infantile and one juvenile type) was determined by means of SDS-PAGE or isoelectric focusing of soluble and insoluble fractions of brain extracts and subsequent western blot analysis with specific antibodies against alphaB-crystallin and each of three phosphorylated serine residues. The level of mammalian small heat shock protein of 25-28 kDa (Hsp27) in the same fraction was also estimated by western blot analysis. The majority of alphaB-crystallin was detected in the insoluble fraction of brain homogenates and phosphorylation was preferentially observed at Ser-59 in both cases. A significant level of phosphorylation at Ser-45 but not Ser-19 was also detected. Hsp27 was found at considerable levels in the insoluble fractions. alphaB-crystallin and phosphorylated forms were detected in the cerebrospinal fluid of patient with the juvenile type. AlphaB-crystallin and phosphorylated forms were also detectable at considerable levels in the insoluble fraction of brain homogenates from patients with Alzheimer's disease and aged controls. The phosphorylation site was mostly at Ser-59 in all cases. Immunohistochemically  alphaB-crystallin was stained in Rosenthal fibers in brains of patients with Alexander's disease and their peripheral portions were immunostained with antibodies recognizing phosphorylated Ser-59. These results indicate that the major phosphorylation site in alphaB-crystallin in brains of patients with Alexander's disease or Alzheimer's disease as well as in aged controls is Ser-59.,0,Ser-59 is the major phosphorylation site in alphaB-crystallin accumulated in the brains of patients with Alexander's disease.The phosphorylation state of alphaB-crystallin accumulated in the brains of two patients with Alexander's disease (one infantile and one juvenile type) was determined by means of SDS-PAGE or isoelectric focusing of soluble and insoluble fractions of brain extracts and subsequent western blot analysis with specific antibodies against alphaB-crystallin and each of three phosphorylated serine residues.

16226,Phosphorylated Tau interacts with c-Jun N-terminal kinase-interacting protein 1 (JIP1) in Alzheimer disease.,In Alzheimer disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia the microtubule-associated protein Tau becomes progressively hyperphosphorylated  eventually forming aggregates. However  how Tau dysfunction is associated with functional impairment is only partly understood  especially at early stages when Tau is mislocalized but has not yet formed aggregates. Impaired axonal transport has been proposed as a potential pathomechanism  based on cellular Tau models and Tau transgenic mice. We recently reported K369I mutant Tau transgenic K3 mice with axonal transport defects that suggested a cargo-selective impairment of kinesin-driven anterograde transport by Tau. Here  we show that kinesin motor complex formation is disturbed in the K3 mice. We show that under pathological conditions hyperphosphorylated Tau interacts with c-Jun N-terminal kinase- interacting protein 1 (JIP1)  which is associated with the kinesin motor protein complex. As a result  transport of JIP1 into the axon is impaired  causing JIP1 to accumulate in the cell body. Because we found trapping of JIP1 and a pathological Tau/JIP1 interaction also in AD brain  this may have pathomechanistic implications in diseases with a Tau pathology. This is supported by JIP1 sequestration in the cell body of Tau-transfected primary neuronal cultures. The pathological Tau/JIP1 interaction requires phosphorylation of Tau  and Tau competes with the physiological binding of JIP1 to kinesin light chain. Because JIP1 is involved in regulating cargo binding to kinesin motors  our findings may  at least in part  explain how hyperphosphorylated Tau mediates impaired axonal transport in AD and frontotemporal dementia.,0,Phosphorylated Tau interacts with c-Jun N-terminal kinase-interacting protein 1 (JIP1) in Alzheimer disease.In Alzheimer disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia the microtubule-associated protein Tau becomes progressively hyperphosphorylated  eventually forming aggregates.

9831,Psychological Well-Being among Older Adults during the Covid-19 Outbreak: A Comparative Study of the Young-Old and the Old-Old Adults,"The COVID-19 outbreak could be considered as an uncontrollable stressful life event. Lockdown measures have provoked a disruption of daily life with a great impact over older adults' health and well-being. Nevertheless, eudaimonic well-being plays a protective role in confronting adverse circumstances, such as the COVID-19 situation. This study aims to assess the association between age and psychological well-being (personal growth and purpose in life). Young-old (60-70 years) and Old-old (71 to 80 years) community-dwelling Spaniards (N = 878) completed a survey and reported on their sociodemographic characteristics and their levels of health, COVID-19 stress-related, appraisal and personal resources. Old-old did not evidence poorer psychological well-being than young-old. Age has only a negative impact on personal growth. The results also suggest that the nature of the COVID-19 impact (except for the loss of a loved one) may not be as relevant for the older adults' well-being as their appraisals and personal resources for managing COVID-related problems. In addition, these results suggest that some sociodemographic and health-related variables have an impact on older adults' well-being.

METHOD(S): An online survey was performed of orthopaedic surgeons in the German-speaking Arthroscopy Society (Gesellschaft fur Arthroskopie und Gelenkchirurgie, AGA). The survey consisted of 20 questions concerning four topics: four questions addressed the origin and surgical experience of the participant, 12 questions dealt with potential cutbacks in orthopaedic healthcare and 4 questions addressed the influence of the pandemic on the particular surgeon. RESULT(S): Of 4234 contacted orthopaedic surgeons, 1399 responded.

The goal of the study was to compare clinical and neuroimaging characteristics of two single-domain MCI subgroups: amnestic MCI and dysexecutive MCI. METHODS: We compared the cognitive  functional  behavioral  and brain imaging characteristics of patients with amnestic MCI (n = 26)  patients with dysexecutive MCI (n = 32)  and age- and education-matched control subjects (n = 36) using analysis of variance and chi(2) tests. We used voxel-based morphometry to examine group differences in brain magnetic resonance imaging atrophy patterns. RESULTS: Patients with dysexecutive MCI had significantly lower scores on the majority of executive function tests  increased behavioral symptoms  and left prefrontal cortex atrophy on magnetic resonance imaging when compared with control subjects. In contrast  patients with amnestic MCI had significantly lower scores on tests of memory and a pattern of atrophy including bilateral hippocampi and entorhinal cortex  right inferior parietal cortex  and posterior cingulate gyrus when compared with control subjects.

59155,Altered brain activation patterns under different working memory loads in patients with type 2 diabetes.,OBJECTIVE: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has important effects on cognition and the risk for Alzheimer disease (AD). Working memory (WM) is a susceptible cognitive domain of mild cognitive impairment and AD. Thus  the identification of brain activation patterns under different WM loads can potentially enhance our understanding of the mechanisms underlying cognitive dysfunction in T2DM. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The current study assessed the effects of T2DM on cognitive performance and explored the related neuronal damage through a visual n-back task and functional magnetic resonance imaging. RESULTS: We found that patients with T2DM exhibited worse executive and memory abilities than control subjects. Furthermore  the patterns of brain activation changed under different WM loads in the T2DM patients  who exhibited reduced activation in the left inferior frontal gyrus under low loads and reduced activation in the left middle frontal gyrus and superior frontal gyrus (SFG) under high loads. Thus  more regions of diminished activation were seen in the frontal cortex with increasing task difficulty. Furthermore  we found that lower SFG activation was associated with worse cognitive function. CONCLUSIONS: The findings demonstrate deficient WM in patients with T2DM and the relation between cognitive function and degree of neuronal activity and their relevance to AD risk. Further longitudinal studies are needed to replicate these results and to evaluate the clinical value of brain imaging methods in the prediction of disease progress in these patients.,0,Altered brain activation patterns under different working memory loads in patients with type 2 diabetes.OBJECTIVE: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has important effects on cognition and the risk for Alzheimer disease (AD).

8072,COVID-19 symptoms predictive of healthcare workers' SARS-CoV-2 PCR results,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19) is caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2, transmissible both person-to-person and from contaminated surfaces. Early COVID-19 detection among healthcare workers (HCWs) is crucial for protecting patients and the healthcare workforce. Because of limited testing capacity, symptom-based screening may prioritize testing and increase diagnostic accuracy. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We performed a retrospective study of HCWs undergoing both COVID-19 telephonic symptom screening and nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 assays during the period, March 9-April 15, 2020. HCWs with negative assays but progressive symptoms were re-tested for SARS-CoV-2. Among 592 HCWs tested, 83 (14%) had an initial positive SARS-CoV-2 assay. Fifty-nine of 61 HCWs (97%) who were asymptomatic or reported only sore throat/nasal congestion had negative SARS-CoV-2 assays (P = 0.006). HCWs reporting three or more symptoms had an increased multivariate-adjusted odds of having positive assays, 1.95 (95% CI: 1.10-3.64), which increased to 2.61 (95% CI: 1.50-4.45) for six or more symptoms. The multivariate-adjusted odds of a positive assay were also increased for HCWs reporting fever and a measured temperature >= 37.5degreeC (3.49 (95% CI: 1.95-6.21)), and those with myalgias (1.83 (95% CI: 1.04-3.23)). Anosmia/ageusia (i.e. loss of smell/loss of taste) was reported less frequently (16%) than other symptoms by HCWs with positive assays, but was associated with more than a seven-fold multivariate-adjusted odds of a positive test: OR = 7.21 (95% CI: 2.95-17.67). Of 509 HCWs with initial negative SARS-CoV-2 assays, nine had symptom progression and positive re-tests, yielding an estimated negative predictive value of 98.2% (95% CI: 96.8-99.0%) for the exclusion of clinically relevant COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Symptom and temperature reports are useful screening tools for predicting SARS-CoV-2 assay results in HCWs. Anosmia/ageusia, fever, and myalgia were the strongest independent predictors of positive assays. The absence of symptoms or symptoms limited to nasal congestion/sore throat were associated with negative assays.",1,"COVID-19 symptoms predictive of healthcare workers' SARS-CoV-2 PCR resultsBACKGROUND: Coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19) is caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2, transmissible both person-to-person and from contaminated surfaces. Early COVID-19 detection among healthcare workers (HCWs) is crucial for protecting patients and the healthcare workforce. Because of limited testing capacity, symptom-based screening may prioritize testing and increase diagnostic accuracy. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We performed a retrospective study of HCWs undergoing both COVID-19 telephonic symptom screening and nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 assays during the period, March 9-April 15, 2020. HCWs with negative assays but progressive symptoms were re-tested for SARS-CoV-2. Among 592 HCWs tested, 83 (14%) had an initial positive SARS-CoV-2 assay. Fifty-nine of 61 HCWs (97%) who were asymptomatic or reported only sore throat/nasal congestion had negative SARS-CoV-2 assays (P = 0.006). HCWs reporting three or more symptoms had an increased multivariate-adjusted odds of having positive assays, 1.95 (95% CI: 1.10-3.64), which increased to 2.61 (95% CI: 1.50-4.45) for six or more symptoms.

Tissue from AD  but not non-demented  brains exhibited a diffuse pattern of staining for fibrinogen and immunoglobulin (IgG) indicative of BBB leakiness with considerable fibrinogen immunoreactivity (ir) appearing in association with Abeta deposits. Immunostaining for the endothelial cell specific glycoprotein  von Willebrand factor  showed morphological evidence for altered blood vessels in AD tissue. AD brains also demonstrated extensive areas of fibrinogen ir in association with microglial reactivity. In vivo  intra-hippocampal injection of Abeta(1-42) caused time-dependent (1-7 days after injection) increases in double staining of fibrinogen with areas of microgliosis. Two independent pharmacological strategies were employed to examine how Abeta(1-42) stimulation (7 days injection) may be linked to neurodegeneration. The defibrinogenating compound  ancrod  reduced inflammatory reactivity  levels of parenchymal fibrinogen and IgG  and was neuroprotective. These results prompted use of Abeta(1-42) plus fibrinogen as a novel in vivo inflammatory stimulus and this combination significantly enhanced inflammatory reactivity  vascular perturbations and neuronal damage compared to Abeta(1-42) alone. A second approach  using anti-Mac-1 (antibody for antigen CD11b) to block activation of microglia  was highly effective in attenuating effects of Abeta(1-42) plus fibrinogen amplification of inflammatory and vascular responses and conferred significant neuroprotection.

41409,Rates of cerebral atrophy differ in different degenerative pathologies.,Neurodegenerative disorders are pathologically characterized by the deposition of abnormal proteins in the brain. It is likely that future treatment trials will target the underlying protein biochemistry and it is therefore increasingly important to be able to distinguish between different pathologies during life. The aim of this study was to determine whether rates of brain atrophy differ in neurodegenerative dementias that vary by pathological diagnoses and characteristic protein biochemistry. Fifty-six autopsied subjects were identified with a clinical diagnosis of dementia and two serial head MRI. Subjects were subdivided based on pathological diagnoses into Alzheimer's disease  dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB)  mixed Alzheimer's disease/DLB  frontotemporal lobar degeneration with ubiquitin-only-immunoreactive changes (FTLD-U)  corticobasal degeneration (CBD) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). Twenty-five controls were matched by age  gender and scan interval  to the study cohort. The boundary-shift integral was used to calculate change over time in whole brain (BBSI) and ventricular volume (VBSI). All BSI results were annualized by adjusting for scan interval. The rates of whole brain atrophy and ventricular expansion were significantly increased compared to controls in the Alzheimer's disease  mixed Alzheimer's disease/DLB  FTLD-U  CBD and PSP groups. However  atrophy rates in the DLB group were not significantly different from control rates of atrophy. The largest rates of atrophy were observed in the CBD group which had a BBSI of 2.3% and VBSI of 16.2%. The CBD group had significantly greater rates of BBSI and VBSI than the DLB  mixed Alzheimer's disease/DLB  Alzheimer's disease and PSP groups  with a similar trend observed when compared to the FTLD-U group. The FTLD-U group showed the next largest rates with a BBSI of 1.7% and VBSI of 9.6% which were both significantly greater than the DLB group. There was no significant difference in the rates of atrophy between the Alzheimer's disease  mixed Alzheimer's disease/DLB and PSP groups  which all showed similar rates of atrophy; BBSI of 1.1  1.3 and 1.0% and VBSI of 8.3  7.2 and 10.9%  respectively. Rates of atrophy therefore differ according to the pathological diagnoses and underlying protein biochemistry. While rates are unlikely to be useful in differentiating Alzheimer's disease from cases with mixed Alzheimer's disease/DLB pathology  they demonstrate important pathophysiological differences between DLB and those with mixed Alzheimer's disease/DLB and Alzheimer's disease pathology  and between those with CBD and PSP pathology.,0,Rates of cerebral atrophy differ in different degenerative pathologies.Neurodegenerative disorders are pathologically characterized by the deposition of abnormal proteins in the brain.

20755,Prolonged Low-Dose Methylprednisolone in Patients With Severe COVID-19 Pneumonia,"Background: In hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia, progression to acute respiratory failure requiring invasive mechanical ventilation (MV) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Severe dysregulated systemic inflammation is the putative mechanism. We hypothesize that early prolonged methylprednisolone (MP) treatment could accelerate disease resolution, decreasing the need for intensive care unit (ICU) admission and mortality. Methods: We conducted a multicenter observational study to explore the association between exposure to prolonged, low-dose MP treatment and need for ICU referral, intubation, or death within 28 days (composite primary end point) in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to Italian respiratory high-dependency units. Secondary outcomes were invasive MV-free days and changes in C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. Results: Findings are reported as MP (n = 83) vs control (n = 90). The composite primary end point was met by 19 vs 40 (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 0.41; 95% CI, 0.24-0.72). Transfer to ICU and invasive MV were necessary in 15 vs 27 (P = .07) and 14 vs 26 (P = .10), respectively. By day 28, the MP group had fewer deaths (6 vs 21; aHR, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.12-0.73) and more days off invasive MV (24.0 +/- 9.0 vs 17.5 +/- 12.8; P = .001). Study treatment was associated with rapid improvement in PaO2:FiO2 and CRP levels. The complication rate was similar for the 2 groups (P = .84). Conclusion: In patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia, early administration of prolonged MP treatment was associated with a significantly lower hazard of death (71%) and decreased ventilator dependence.

Severe dysregulated systemic inflammation is the putative mechanism. We hypothesize that early prolonged methylprednisolone (MP) treatment could accelerate disease resolution, decreasing the need for intensive care unit (ICU) admission and mortality. Methods: We conducted a multicenter observational study to explore the association between exposure to prolonged, low-dose MP treatment and need for ICU referral, intubation, or death within 28 days (composite primary end point) in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to Italian respiratory high-dependency units. Secondary outcomes were invasive MV-free days and changes in C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. Results: Findings are reported as MP (n = 83) vs control (n = 90). The composite primary end point was met by 19 vs 40 (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 0.41; 95% CI, 0.24-0.72).

24637,Clinical spectrum and risk factors for complicated disease course in children admitted with SARS-CoV-2 infection,"INTRODUCTION: At this time there are still major questions about the characteristics of disease caused by the new coronavirus (COVID-19) in children as well as factors associated with the development of severe forms of the disease. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective study including patients under 18 years of age admitted with SARS-CoV-2 infection from March 1 to April 30, 2020. Infection was confirmed by realtime reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or antibody testing. We describe the epidemiological and clinical data, laboratory and imaging findings, as well as treatment and outcome in these patients. In light of these findings, patients were classified into two severity groups and then compared. RESULTS: Thirty-nine children were included, with a median age of 9 years (range 12 days-16 years); 23 were boys. Cases with uncomplicated disease course (24) mostly presented to the emergency department (ED) with fever and/or respiratory symptoms without significant alterations in laboratory findings. Of the 15 children with a complicated course, 12 developed shock. In addition to fever, they frequently presented altered appearance, extreme tachycardia, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, rash, and/or conjunctival hyperemia. They also showed greater lymphopenia (p = 0.001), elevated neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (p = 0.001), C-reactive protein (p < 0.001), procalcitonin (p = 0.001), D-dimer (p < 0.001), and ferritin (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 infection in admitted children presents with great clinical variability. When provided supportive care, patients with predominant respiratory symptoms without altered laboratory-test results generally have an uncomplicated course. Patients with complicated disease present mainly with fever and abdominal and/or mucocutaneous symptoms. Most develop shock.

To examine its clinical validity and evaluate whether it adds predictive power to NFT-based staging  we performed a study comparing both neuropathological classifications with clinical dementia rating scale (CDR) scores in a large autopsy series. The 2 neuropathological staging systems were strongly correlated. Their association with clinical severity was highly significant. However  the strength of the relationship was greater for NFT-based staging. It accounted for 26.5% of the variability in clinical severity  Abeta-protein-based staging for 13.0%  and age for 4.4%. Compared to NFT-based staging  the Abeta-protein-based system was less able to distinguish mild cognitive changes from dementia and showed marked overlap among the various stages of cognitive decline. In a multivariate model  NFT and age together accounted for 27.2% of the clinical variability and the addition of Abeta-protein deposition staging could only explain an extra 2.9%.

We counted the numbers and calculated the minor allele frequency (MAF) of each mutation type. Results: Nearly half of the point mutations are C-T mismatches and 20% are A-G mismatches. The MAF of C-T and A-G mismatches is significantly higher than MAF of other mutation types. Conclusion: The excessive C-T mismatches do not resemble the random mutation profile.

Fourteen cases of VD (9 males and 5 females)  18 cases of dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT)(7 males and 11 females)  29 cases of cerebrovascular disease (CVD) in the chronic phase (18 males and 11 females) and 47 healthy individuals as controls (25 males and 22 females) were examined for serum Lp(a). Serum concentrations and phenotypes of Lp(a) were assessed by ELISA and a test kit for the Lp(a) phenotype  respectively. Serum concentrations of Lp(a) were significantly higher in patients with VD (p < 0.05) as well as patients with CVD (p < 0.01) compared with those in healthy individuals. Serum concentrations of Lp(a) did not significantly differ between patients with DAT and healthy individuals. The incidences of Lp(a) phenotypes containing relatively low-molecular-weight apolipoprotein(a) isoforms were significantly higher in patients with CVD in the chronic phase (p < 0.05) or those with VD (p < 0.01) compared with those in healthy individuals.

61614,Development and Clinical Evaluation of a Web-Based Upper Limb Home Rehabilitation System Using a Smartwatch and Machine Learning Model for Chronic Stroke Survivors: Prospective Comparative Study,"BACKGROUND: Recent advancements in wearable sensor technology have shown the feasibility of remote physical therapy at home. In particular, the current COVID-19 pandemic has revealed the need and opportunity of internet-based wearable technology in future health care systems. Previous research has shown the feasibility of human activity recognition technologies for monitoring rehabilitation activities in home environments; however, few comprehensive studies ranging from development to clinical evaluation exist. OBJECTIVE(S): This study aimed to (1) develop a home-based rehabilitation (HBR) system that can recognize and record the type and frequency of rehabilitation exercises conducted by the user using a smartwatch and smartphone app equipped with a machine learning (ML) algorithm and (2) evaluate the efficacy of the home-based rehabilitation system through a prospective comparative study with chronic stroke survivors. METHOD(S): The HBR system involves an off-the-shelf smartwatch, a smartphone, and custom-developed apps. A convolutional neural network was used to train the ML algorithm for detecting home exercises. To determine the most accurate way for detecting the type of home exercise, we compared accuracy results with the data sets of personal or total data and accelerometer, gyroscope, or accelerometer combined with gyroscope data. From March 2018 to February 2019, we conducted a clinical study with two groups of stroke survivors. In total, 17 and 6 participants were enrolled for statistical analysis in the HBR group and control group, respectively. To measure clinical outcomes, we performed the Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT), Fugl-Meyer Assessment of Upper Extremity, grip power test, Beck Depression Inventory, and range of motion (ROM) assessment of the shoulder joint at 0, 6, and 12 months, and at a follow-up assessment 6 weeks after retrieving the HBR system. RESULT(S): The ML model created with personal data involving accelerometer combined with gyroscope data (5590/5601, 99.80%) was the most accurate compared with accelerometer (5496/5601, 98.13%) or gyroscope data (5381/5601, 96.07%). In the comparative study, the drop-out rates in the control and HBR groups were 40% (4/10) and 22% (5/22) at 12 weeks and 100% (10/10) and 45% (10/22) at 18 weeks, respectively. The HBR group (n=17) showed a significant improvement in the mean WMFT score (P=.02) and ROM of flexion (P=.004) and internal rotation (P=.001). The control group (n=6) showed a significant change only in shoulder internal rotation (P=.03). CONCLUSION(S): This study found that a home care system using a commercial smartwatch and ML model can facilitate participation in home training and improve the functional score of the WMFT and shoulder ROM of flexion and internal rotation in the treatment of patients with chronic stroke. This strategy can possibly be a cost-effective tool for the home care treatment of stroke survivors in the future.

The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has exacerbated these mental health risks brought about by isolation and exhaustion. Delegated to be a national COVID-19 referral centre, the University of the Philippines-Philippine General Hospital faced many challenges, including the increased workload in a perilous and anxiety-inducing national crisis which placed the entire healthcare team in an unprecedented situation. To adapt to these challenges, the Division of Medical Oncology employed the following measures to safeguard the mental health of its faculty and fellows: 1) use of psychological support materials; 2) initiation of a psychological intervention programme and 3) establishment of peer support programmes. Caring for the carers through evidence-based interventions ensures the delivery of quality care to our cancer patients despite the challenges during these trying times.

52308,Predictors of Favorable Outcome of Intracranial Basilar Dissecting Aneurysm,Background Management of intracranial basilar dissecting aneurysms has been controversial and challenging  and surgical and conservative treatments usually have a bad prognosis. Our study aimed at evaluating the outcomes of endovascular treatment for these lesions and exploring the predictors of favorable outcome. Methods We retrospectively reviewed 50 consecutive patients with basilar dissecting aneurysms from January 2006 to January 2013. Twenty-four patients underwent stent-assisted coiling whereas 26 patients underwent conservative treatment. Follow-up outcomes were evaluated using modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score. Results Of the patients treated with stent-assisted coiling  20 patients had a favorable outcome (mRS score  0-1)  post-treatment recurrence occurred in 3 patients  1 had rebleeding  and 2 had no rebleeding. Of the patients treated with conservative therapy (observation or anticoagulation)  10 patients had an unfavorable outcome  2 patients with ruptured aneurysms developed rebleeding  and 8 patients had poor outcome because of infarct progression. Stent-assisted coiling group had a more favorable outcome than the conservatively treated group (83.3% versus 55.2%  P =.019). Initial complete obliteration was related to the favorable outcome in endovascular-treated group (P =.042). Stent placement was the only independent predictor of favorable outcome in the logistic regression analysis (P =.030; odds ratio = 5.828; 95% confidence interval  1.192-28.503). Conclusions Patients with basilar artery dissecting aneurysms treated with stent-assisted coiling had a more favorable outcome than the conservatively treated patients. Stent placement and initial complete occlusion were the favorable factors in patients with basilar dissecting aneurysm.,0,Predictors of Favorable Outcome of Intracranial Basilar Dissecting AneurysmBackground Management of intracranial basilar dissecting aneurysms has been controversial and challenging  and surgical and conservative treatments usually have a bad prognosis.

9041,Development of a COVID-19 alternate care site from ground zero: A nursing perspective,"The novel coronavirus disease SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) outbreak rapidly generated an unprecedented global, national, and state public health crisis with the need to rapidly develop alternate care sites (ACS) to care for COVID-19 patients within an overburdened health care system. A hospital care model ACS to increase the health care capacity, provide care for mild to moderately symptomatic patients, and offer local self-sustainment for a surge of patients was developed in Memphis, Tennessee located in Shelby County. We completed a temporary conversion of a large unused newspaper publication building to a health care facility for COVID-19 patients. Developing an ACS from ground zero was met with many challenges, and throughout the process important lessons were learned. With the goal to complete the building conversion within a 28-day timeframe, collaboration among the numerous governmental, health care, and private agencies was critical and nursing leadership was key to this process. The purpose of this paper is to describe the development of a COVID-19 ACS in Memphis, TN, which has a large at-risk population with limited access to health care. Specifically, we will discuss the strong leadership role of nursing faculty, key challenges, and lessons learned, as well as provide checklists and models for others in similar circumstances.

4270,Pre-outbreak determinants of perceived risks of corona infection and preventive measures taken : A prospective population-based study,"Objectives Assess how people perceive the risks of coronavirus infection, whether people take preventive measures, and which pre-outbreak factors contribute to the perceived risks and measures taken, such as pre-outbreak respiratory problems, heart problems, diabetes, anxiety and depression symptoms, loneliness, age, gender, marital and employment status and education level. Methods Data were collected in the longitudinal LISS panel, based on a random sample of the Dutch population. The coronavirus survey started on March 2, and the data collection ended on March 17 2020. Data were linked with surveys on health and social integration conducted at the end of 2019 (Nstudy sample = 3,540). Results About 15% perceived the risk of infection as high, and 11% the risk becoming ill when infected. Multivariable logistic regression analyses showed the following. Older age-groups perceived the risk for coronavirus infection as lower (all adjusted Odd Ratio's [aOR] .070). In total, 43.8% had taken preventive measures, especially females (aOR = 1.46, 95% CI = 1.26-1.70). Those with lower education levels less often used preventive measures (aOR = 0.55, 95% CI = 0.45-0.67). Those with pre-outbreak respiratory problems (aOR = 2.75, 95% CI = 2.11-3.57), heart problems (aOR = 1.97, 95% CI = 1.34-2.92) and diabetes (aOR = 3.12, 95% CI = 2.02-4.82) perceived the risk becoming ill when infected as higher than others. However, respondents with pre-outbreak respiratory problems and diabetes did not more often take preventive measures. Conclusions Vulnerable patients more often recognize that they are at risk becoming ill when infected by the coronavirus, but many do not take preventive measures. Interventions to stimulate the use of preventive measures should pay additional attention to physically vulnerable patients, males and those with lower education levels.Copyright ÁE© 2020 van der Velden et al.

25194,Fluorescence resonance energy transfer analysis of apolipoprotein E C-terminal domain and amyloid beta peptide (1-42) interaction.,The potential neurotoxicity of soluble forms of amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) as a key factor in early pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease is being recognized. In addition  there is growing evidence of the essential role of apolipoprotein E (apoE) in amyloid formation  although molecular details of apoE/Abeta interaction are poorly understood. We employed apoE C-terminal (CT) domain comprising residues 201-299 to identify binding location of Abeta(1-42) by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) and quenching analyses. Native tryptophan (Trp) residues in the apoE CT domain served as FRET donor  whereas N-(iodoacetyl)-N'-(5-sulfo-1-naphthyl)ethylenediamine (AEDANS) covalently attached to a unique cysteine residue substituted at position 4 of Abeta(1-42) (AEDANS-F4C-Abeta(1-42)) served as FRET acceptor. Fluorescence analysis verified that the oligomerization behavior of AEDANS-F4C-Abeta(1-42) was not abrogated by covalent attachment of AEDANS and that apoE CT domain/AEDANS-F4C-Abeta(1-42) association results in formation of a soluble complex. A large decrease in Trp fluorescence emission was noted in mixtures containing apoE CT domain and AEDANS-F4C-Abeta(1-42)  accompanied by appearance of sensitized fluorescence emission of AEDANS as a result of intermolecular FRET. An average distance of separation of 22.6 Angstroms between donors and acceptor was calculated. Fluorescence quenching by potassium iodide (KI) did not reveal significant differences in apoE CT domain Trp microenvironment in the absence or the presence of Abeta(1-42). A twofold increase in quenching constant was noted for KI quenching of AEDANS fluorescence emission in the presence of apoE CT domain  indicative of alterations in Abeta conformation upon interaction with apoE CT domain. We propose intermolecular FRET analysis as a discriminating approach to examine apoE/Abeta interaction  a potentially critical factor in early events involved in amyloid formation.,0,Fluorescence resonance energy transfer analysis of apolipoprotein E C-terminal domain and amyloid beta peptide (1-42) interaction.The potential neurotoxicity of soluble forms of amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) as a key factor in early pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease is being recognized.

19683,Accuracy of spatial normalization of the hippocampus: implications for fMRI research in memory disorders.,Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies in memory impairment have detected functional alterations in medial temporal lobe (MTL) structures  notably the hippocampus. Many of these studies employ spatial normalization to place subjects in a standardized template space prior to analysis; however  little is known about the effects of local atrophy on the normalization process in structures such as the hippocampus. The purpose of this study was to compare the accuracy of spatial normalization of the hippocampus between memory-impaired patients and controls. Twenty clinically-defined mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects and twenty elderly controls were studied at 4T with structural and functional MRI during a memory encoding-retrieval task. Bilateral hippocampal regions-of-interest (ROIs) were manually drawn for all subjects and further divided into anterior/posterior subregions. To assess normalization accuracy to the Montreal Neurological Institute template  the percentage of each template-defined hippocampal ROI originating from true hippocampal tissue was determined for all subjects. To assess the ability of spatial normalization to equalize group differences in hippocampal volume  pre- and post-normalization hippocampal volumes were compared. Finally  fMRI measures from template and non-template analyses were compared. Poorer normalization accuracy of the bilateral hippocampi  particularly the posterior portions  was found for MCI subjects. Significant group differences were found in left hippocampal and bilateral posterior hippocampal volumes  and these differences were not corrected with normalization. Hippocampal volumes were significantly correlated with normalization accuracy across MCI and control groups  but some significant differences in normalization accuracy persisted independent of these volume differences. Template and non-template fMRI analyses were significantly correlated in controls  but not MCI subjects  during memory retrieval. These findings suggest decreased normalization accuracy in memory-impaired subjects is a potentially important confounder of template-based fMRI analyses in the hippocampus and MTL.,0,Accuracy of spatial normalization of the hippocampus: implications for fMRI research in memory disorders.Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies in memory impairment have detected functional alterations in medial temporal lobe (MTL) structures  notably the hippocampus.

The interaction site was mapped to the unique phospho-Thr231-Pro232 motif  despite the presence of many other Thr/Ser-Pro phosphorylation sites in Tau and structural evidence that the interaction site does not significantly extend beyond those very two residues. We demonstrate here by NMR and fluorescence mapping that the Alzheimer's disease specific epitope centered around the phospho-Thr212-Pro213 motif is also an interaction site  and that the sole phospho-Thr-Pro motif is already sufficient for interaction. Because a detectable fraction of the Pro213 amide bond in the peptide centered around the phospho-Thr212-Pro213 motif is in the cis conformation  catalysis of the isomerization by the catalytic domain of Pin1 could be investigated via NMR spectroscopy.,0,The peptidyl prolyl cis/trans-isomerase Pin1 recognizes the phospho-Thr212-Pro213 site on Tau.The interaction between the neuronal Tau protein and the Pin1 prolyl cis/trans-isomerase is dependent on the phosphorylation state of the former.

51290,Differential expression of cholesterol hydroxylases in Alzheimer's disease.,Cholesterol is eliminated from neurons by oxidization  which generates oxysterols. Cholesterol oxidation is mediated by the enzymes cholesterol 24-hydroxylase (CYP46A1) and cholesterol 27-hydroxylase (CYP27A1). Immunocytochemical studies show that CYP46A1 and CYP27A1 are expressed in neurons and some astrocytes in the normal brain  and CYP27A1 is present in oligodendrocytes. In Alzheimer's disease (AD)  CYP46A1 shows prominent expression in astrocytes and around amyloid plaques  whereas CYP27A1 expression decreases in neurons and is not apparent around amyloid plaques but increases in oligodendrocytes. Although previous studies have examined the effects of synthetic oxysterols on the processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP)  the actions of the naturally occurring oxysterols have yet to be examined. To understand the role of cholesterol oxidation in AD  we compared the effects of 24(S)- and 27-hydroxycholesterol on the processing of APP and analyzed the cell-specific expression patterns of the two cholesterol hydroxylases in the human brain. Both oxysterols inhibited production of Abeta in neurons  but 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol was approximately 1000-fold more potent than 27-hydroxycholesterol. The IC(50) of 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol for inhibiting Abeta secretion was approximately 1 nm. Both oxysterols induced ABCA1 expression with IC(50) values similar to that for inhibition of A beta secretion  suggesting the involvement of liver X receptor. Oxysterols also inhibited protein kinase C activity and APP secretion following stimulation of protein kinase C. The selective expression of CYP46A1 around neuritic plaques and the potent inhibition of APP processing in neurons by 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol suggests that CYP46A1 affects the pathophysiology of AD and provides insight into how polymorphisms in the CYP46A1 gene might influence the pathophysiology of this prevalent disease.,0,Differential expression of cholesterol hydroxylases in Alzheimer's disease.Cholesterol is eliminated from neurons by oxidization  which generates oxysterols.

24326,Linkage of plasma Abeta42 to a quantitative locus on chromosome 10 in late-onset Alzheimer's disease pedigrees.,Plasma Abeta42 (amyloid beta42 peptide) is invariably elevated in early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease (AD)  and it is also increased in the first-degree relatives of patients with typical late-onset AD (LOAD). To detect LOAD loci that increase Abeta42  we used plasma Abeta42 as a surrogate trait and performed linkage analysis on extended AD pedigrees identified through a LOAD patient with extremely high plasma Abeta. Here  we report linkage to chromosome 10 with a maximal lod score of 3.93 at 81 centimorgans close to D10S1225. Remarkably  linkage to the same region was obtained independently in a genome-wide screen of LOAD sibling pairs. These results provide strong evidence for a novel LOAD locus on chromosome 10 that acts to increase Abeta.,0,Linkage of plasma Abeta42 to a quantitative locus on chromosome 10 in late-onset Alzheimer's disease pedigrees.Plasma Abeta42 (amyloid beta42 peptide) is invariably elevated in early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease (AD)  and it is also increased in the first-degree relatives of patients with typical late-onset AD (LOAD).

Interpretation of computed cranial tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients with brain tumors is complicated by changes related to surgery  corticosteroids  radiation  and chemotherapy. We investigated the role of 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) in these difficult diagnostic situations by obtaining FDG-PET scans in 5 patients following temporal lobectomy for epilepsy  in 5 patients with recurrent anaplastic gliomas before and after corticosteroid therapy  and in 5 patients after the development of histologically confirmed radionecrosis. We also obtained postoperative FDG-PET scans in 32 consecutive patients undergoing initial resection of a primary brain tumor. Our results indicate that glucose uptake as detected by FDG-PET scanning with [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose is not increased in the postoperative period; is not affected by steroid therapy; and accurately predicts early recurrence of tumor  supplementing other predictors of tumor behavior  including extent of resection  histological diagnosis  and postoperative CT.

12351,Comparative PET/CT study with 11C-MET and 18F-FDG for diagnosing glioma,In this paper  we investigate the diagnostic value of 11C-methionine (MET) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) for brain gliomas  and compare the results to 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose. Forty-four patients with suspected gliomas were examined with 11C-MET and 18F-FDG PET/CT. 18F-FDG and 11C-MET PET/CT images were compared and evaluated by visual and semiquantitative analysis. The accuracy of 11C-MET and 18F-FDG PET/CT for detecting gliomas were 88.6% and 65.9%  respectively. Semiquantitative analysis showed that the 26 gliomas had higher mean ± SD T/NGmax ratio on 11C-MET PET/CT than on 18F-FDG PET/CT (1.95 ± 0.52 vs. 0.90 ± 0.27  t = 9.101  P &lt; 0.001). 11C-MET had a higher sensitivity than 18F-FDG (83.3% vs. 33.3%  x2 = 4.16  P &lt; 0.05) for low-grade gliomas  but it did not differ significantly from 18F-FDG in the sensitivity for high-grade gliomas (100% vs. 64.3%  x2 = 3.20  P &gt; 0.05). The difference was no significant  too  between high- and low-grade gliomas  compared by 11C-MET T/NGmax ratio (2.07 ± 0.51 vs. 1.81 ± 0.52  t = 1.302  P = 0.205). 18F-FDGT/NGmax ratio in high-grade gliomas was significantly higher than that in low-grade gliomas (1.03 ± 0.30 vs. 0.75 ± 0.11  t = 3.198  P = 0.004). It is concluded that 11C-MET PET/CT is more accurate than 18F-FDG PET/CT for detecting and delineating gliomas  especially for low-grade gliomas  and it can play a complement role to 18F-FDG in tumor grading.,0,Comparative PET/CT study with 11C-MET and 18F-FDG for diagnosing gliomaIn this paper  we investigate the diagnostic value of 11C-methionine (MET) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) for brain gliomas  and compare the results to 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose.

1588,Identification of Novel Tau Interactions with Endoplasmic Reticulum Proteins in Alzheimer's Disease Brain.,Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that is pathologically characterized by the formation of extracellular amyloid plaques and intraneuronal tau tangles. We recently identified that tau associates with proteins known to participate in endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation (ERAD); consequently  ERAD becomes dysfunctional and causes neurotoxicity. We hypothesized that tau associates with other ER proteins  and that this association could also lead to cellular dysfunction in AD. Portions of human AD and non-demented age matched control brains were fractionated to obtain microsomes  from which tau was co-immunoprecipitated. Samples from both conditions containing tau and its associated proteins were analyzed by mass spectrometry. In total  we identified 91 ER proteins that co-immunoprecipitated with tau; 15.4% were common between AD and control brains  and 42.9% only in the AD samples. The remainder  41.8% of the proteins  was only seen in the control brain samples. We identified a variety of previously unreported interactions between tau and ER proteins. These proteins participate in over sixteen functional categories  the most abundant being involved in RNA translation. We then determined that association of tau with these ER proteins was different between the AD and control samples. We found that tau associated equally with the ribosomal protein L28 but more robustly with the ribosomal protein P0. These data suggest that the differential association between tau and ER proteins in disease could reveal the pathogenic processes by which tau induces cellular dysfunction.,0,Identification of Novel Tau Interactions with Endoplasmic Reticulum Proteins in Alzheimer's Disease Brain.Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that is pathologically characterized by the formation of extracellular amyloid plaques and intraneuronal tau tangles.

10840,"Incidence of myocardial injury in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): a pooled analysis of 7,679 patients from 53 studies","Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become global pandemic and resulted in considerable morbidity and mortality since December 2019. Information on the incidence of myocardial injury remains scarce. Methods: English-language databases (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane), Chinese-language databases (CNKI, VIP, WANFANG), and preprint platform were searched to identify studies that reported the myocardial injury data in COVID-19 patients. Random-effects meta-analyses were used to derive the pooled incidence and relative risks (RRs) of myocardial injury. Variations by disease severity were examined by subgroup analyses. Sensitivity analyses were performed to strengthen the results. Meta-regression was applied to explore the risk factors associated with myocardial injury. Results: A total of 53 studies involving 7,679 patients were included. The pooled incidence of myocardial injury was 21% [95% confidence interval (CI), 17-25%; I2, 96.5%]. The highest incidence of myocardial injury was found in non-survivors (66%; 95 CI%, 54-78%; I2, 85.7%), followed by severe patients (43%; 95 CI%, 33-53%; I2, 93.0%) and non-severe patients (11%; 95 CI%, 7-15%; I2, 95.2%). Higher risk of myocardial injury was detected in severe patients than non-severe patients (RR, 5.74; 95% CI, 3.74-8.79; I2, 86.8%). All the sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of primacy results. Conclusions: This meta-analysis showed that myocardial injury occurred in 21% of COVID-19 patients.

39994,Subjective cognitive impairment: increased prefrontal cortex activation compared to controls during an encoding task.,OBJECTIVE: Subjective cognitive impairment (SCI) has been proposed as a clinical stage which may precede mild cognitive impairment in the clinical continuum of AD  and is characterised by the presence of subjective memory complaints in the absence of objective cognitive deficits. Specific memory-related brain activation differences have been reported in mild cognitive impairment and in cognitively normal individuals at known genetic risk of AD; our objective was to determine whether similar differences are present in people with SCI. METHODS: We compared brain activation in a memory clinic sample of 10 SCI subjects and 10 controls during a verbal episodic memory encoding task using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). RESULTS: There were no differences between groups on measures of encoding success (recognition accuracy) nor was there evidence of altered semantic processing. Both groups activated left prefrontal cortex (PFC) and cerebellum during encoding. The SCI group also demonstrated activation in left medial temporal  occipitoparietal and medial frontal cortex. Group comparisons revealed increased activation in SCI in left PFC  where activation strength correlated with memory task performance. CONCLUSIONS: The activation differences reported in this study may reflect the employment of compensatory strategies in the face of early AD pathology  although a number of alternative explanations need to be considered. Further studies with larger samples may help to determine whether the observed activation changes are likely to be associated with early neuropathological processes or with other unrelated factors.,0,Subjective cognitive impairment: increased prefrontal cortex activation compared to controls during an encoding task.OBJECTIVE: Subjective cognitive impairment (SCI) has been proposed as a clinical stage which may precede mild cognitive impairment in the clinical continuum of AD  and is characterised by the presence of subjective memory complaints in the absence of objective cognitive deficits.

50125,Prototype Alzheimer's disease vaccine using the immunodominant B cell epitope from beta-amyloid and promiscuous T cell epitope pan HLA DR-binding peptide.,Immunization of amyloid precursor protein transgenic mice with fibrillar beta-amyloid (Abeta) prevents Alzheimer's disease (AD)-like neuropathology. The first immunotherapy clinical trial used fibrillar Abeta  containing the B and T cell self epitopes of Abeta  as the immunogen formulated with QS21 as the adjuvant in the vaccine. Unfortunately  the clinical trial was halted during the phase II stage when 6% of the participants developed meningoencephalitis. The cause of the meningoencephalitis in the patients that received the vaccine has not been definitively determined; however  analysis of two case reports from the AN-1792 vaccine trial suggest that the meningoencephalitis may have been caused by a T cell-mediated autoimmune response  whereas production of anti-Abeta Abs may have been therapeutic to the AD patients. Therefore  to reduce the risk of an adverse T cell-mediated immune response to Abeta immunotherapy we have designed a prototype epitope vaccine that contains the immunodominant B cell epitope of Abeta in tandem with the synthetic universal Th cell pan HLA DR epitope  pan HLA DR-binding peptide (PADRE). Importantly  the PADRE-Abeta(1-15) sequence lacks the T cell epitope of Abeta. Immunization of BALB/c mice with the PADRE-Abeta(1-15) epitope vaccine produced high titers of anti-Abeta Abs. Splenocytes from immunized mice showed robust T cell stimulation in response to peptides containing PADRE. However  splenocytes from immunized mice were not reactivated by the Abeta peptide. New preclinical trials in amyloid precursor protein transgenic mouse models may help to develop novel immunogen-adjuvant configurations with the potential to avoid the adverse events that occurred in the first clinical trial.,0,Prototype Alzheimer's disease vaccine using the immunodominant B cell epitope from beta-amyloid and promiscuous T cell epitope pan HLA DR-binding peptide.Immunization of amyloid precursor protein transgenic mice with fibrillar beta-amyloid (Abeta) prevents Alzheimer's disease (AD)-like neuropathology.

The cause of the meningoencephalitis in the patients that received the vaccine has not been definitively determined; however  analysis of two case reports from the AN-1792 vaccine trial suggest that the meningoencephalitis may have been caused by a T cell-mediated autoimmune response  whereas production of anti-Abeta Abs may have been therapeutic to the AD patients. Therefore  to reduce the risk of an adverse T cell-mediated immune response to Abeta immunotherapy we have designed a prototype epitope vaccine that contains the immunodominant B cell epitope of Abeta in tandem with the synthetic universal Th cell pan HLA DR epitope  pan HLA DR-binding peptide (PADRE). Importantly  the PADRE-Abeta(1-15) sequence lacks the T cell epitope of Abeta. Immunization of BALB/c mice with the PADRE-Abeta(1-15) epitope vaccine produced high titers of anti-Abeta Abs. Splenocytes from immunized mice showed robust T cell stimulation in response to peptides containing PADRE. However  splenocytes from immunized mice were not reactivated by the Abeta peptide. New preclinical trials in amyloid precursor protein transgenic mouse models may help to develop novel immunogen-adjuvant configurations with the potential to avoid the adverse events that occurred in the first clinical trial.,"{'judgement': 'False', 'index': 414}",0,"{'judgement': 'False', 'index': 414}",0,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 414}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 414}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 414}",1
17442,Glucose-6-phosphatase deficiency.,Abstract. Glucose-6-phosphatase deficiency (G6P deficiency)  or glycogen storage disease type I (GSDI)  is a group of inherited metabolic diseases  including types Ia and Ib  characterized by poor tolerance to fasting  growth retardation and hepatomegaly resulting from accumulation of glycogen and fat in the liver. Prevalence is unknown and annual incidence is around 1/100 000 births. GSDIa is the more frequent type  representing about 80% of GSDI patients. The disease commonly manifests  between the ages of 3 to 4 months by symptoms of hypoglycemia (tremors  seizures  cyanosis  apnea). Patients have poor tolerance to fasting  marked hepatomegaly  growth retardation (small stature and delayed puberty)  generally improved by an appropriate diet  osteopenia and sometimes osteoporosis  full-cheeked round face  enlarged kydneys and platelet dysfunctions leading to frequent epistaxis. In addition  in GSDIb  neutropenia and neutrophil dysfunction are responsible for tendency towards infections  relapsing aphtous gingivostomatitis  and inflammatory bowel disease. Late complications are hepatic (adenomas with rare but possible transformation into hepatocarcinoma) and renal (glomerular hyperfiltration leading to proteinuria and sometimes to renal insufficiency). GSDI is caused by a dysfunction in the G6P system  a key step in the regulation of glycemia. The deficit concerns the catalytic subunit G6P-alpha (type Ia) which is restricted to expression in the liver  kidney and intestine  or the ubiquitously expressed G6P transporter (type Ib). Mutations in the genes G6PC (17q21) and SLC37A4 (11q23) respectively cause GSDIa and Ib. Many mutations have been identified in both genes . Transmission is autosomal recessive. Diagnosis is based on clinical presentation  on abnormal basal values and absence of hyperglycemic response to glucagon. It can be confirmed by demonstrating a deficient activity of a G6P system component in a liver biopsy. To date  the diagnosis is most commonly confirmed by G6PC (GSDIa) or SLC37A4 (GSDIb) gene analysis  and the indications of liver biopsy to measure G6P activity are getting rarer and rarer. Differential diagnoses include the other GSDs  in particular type III (see this term). However  in GSDIII  glycemia and lactacidemia are high after a meal and low after a fast period (often with a later occurrence than that of type I). Primary liver tumors and Pepper syndrome (hepatic metastases of neuroblastoma) may be evoked but are easily ruled out through clinical and ultrasound data.

50065,Longitudinal study of chronic depressive symptoms and regional cerebral blood flow in older men and women.,OBJECTIVES: Late-life depression is associated with alterations in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and metabolism in a neural network that includes frontostriatal and limbic regions and the cerebellum. Prior studies suggest that clinical depression and subthreshold depressive symptoms (SDS) are associated with similar cognitive deficits and structural brain changes  but little is known about the relationship between SDS and patterns of brain activity. Additionally  the neural correlates of depression have not been fully explored in men and women separately. This study investigated cross-sectional and longitudinal relationships between SDS and rCBF in older men and women. METHODS: Sixty-one dementia-free older adults (35 men  26 women)  56 years of age and older at baseline  from the neuroimaging substudy of the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging participated. Participants underwent resting-state PET scans at baseline and at year 9 and completed the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale annually. RESULTS: At 8-year follow-up  both men and women showed cross-sectional associations between mean depressive symptom scores and activity in primarily frontal and temporal regions and the cerebellum. Higher average depressive symptoms were associated with longitudinal rCBF decreases in frontal regions in both men and women  and in temporal regions in men. CONCLUSION: Regions showing associations between activity and SDS were similar to those found in studies of clinical depression  providing support for the hypothesis that depressive syndromes exist on a continuum of severity. Sex differences in associations provide some evidence that the pathophysiology of depressive disorders differs between men and women.,0,Longitudinal study of chronic depressive symptoms and regional cerebral blood flow in older men and women.OBJECTIVES: Late-life depression is associated with alterations in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and metabolism in a neural network that includes frontostriatal and limbic regions and the cerebellum.

Methods: The retrospective study included 7 critical COVID-19 patients with acro-ischemia in a single center in Wuhan, from Feb 4 to Feb 15, 2020. The clinical and laboratory data before and during the ICU stay were analyzed. Results: The median age of 7 patients was 59 years and 4 of them were men. 3 of them were associated with underlying comorbidities. Fever, cough, dyspnea and diarrhea were common clinical symptoms. All patients had acro-ischemia presentations including finger/toe cyanosis, skin bulla and dry gangrene. D-dimer, fibrinogen and fibrinogen degradation product (FDP) were significantly elevated in most patients. Prothrombin time (PT) were prolonged in 4 patients. D-dimer and FDP levels increased progressively when COVID-2019 exacerbated, and 4 patients were diagnosed with definite disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). 6 patients received low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) treatment, after which their D-dimer and FDP decreased, but there was no significant improvement in clinical symptoms. 5 patients died finally and the median time from acro-ischemia to death was 12 days.

9982,Outcomes in patients with severe COVID-19 disease treated with tocilizumab: a case-controlled study,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is an ongoing threat to society. Patients who develop the most severe forms of the disease have high mortality. The interleukin-6 inhibitor tocilizumab has the potential to improve outcomes in these patients by preventing the development of cytokine release storm. AIMS: To evaluate the outcomes of patients with severe COVID-19 disease treated with the interleukin-6 inhibitor tocilizumab. METHOD(S): We conducted a retrospective, case-control, single-center study in patients with severe to critical COVID-19 disease treated with tocilizumab. Disease severity was defined based on the amount of oxygen supplementation required. The primary endpoint was the overall mortality. Secondary endpoints were mortality in non-intubated patients and mortality in intubated patients. RESULT(S): A total of 193 patients were included in the study. Ninety-six patients received tocilizumab, while 97 served as the control group. The mean age was 60years. Patients over 65years represented 43% of the population. More patients in the tocilizumab group reported fever, cough and shortness of breath (83%, 80% and 96% vs. 73%, 69% and 71%, respectively). There was a non-statistically significant lower mortality in the treatment group (52% vs. 62.1%, P=0.09). When excluding intubated patients, there was statistically significant lower mortality in patients treated with tocilizumab (6% vs. 27%, P=0.024). Bacteremia was more common in the control group (24% vs. 13%, P=0.43), while fungemia was similar for both (3% vs. 4%, P=0.72).

This study explores the impact of political distrust on the spread of COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria. The study utilised qualitative dominant mixed methods approach comprising telephone interviews and a survey of 120 educated Nigerians purposively selected from four COVID-19 most affected states including Lagos, Oyo, Kano and Rivers as well as the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja. The study also relied on secondary data on the spread of COVID-19 in Nigeria sourced from Nigeria Centre for Diseases Control from 27 February to 31st August 2020. The study found that political corruption motivates large-scale political distrust. This undermines public compliance to government protocols, limits the outcomes of government responses to COVID-19 and facilitates the spread of the virus in Nigeria. The paper concludes that improving government accountability in the public sector management is relevant for building public trust, promoting citizens' compliance to COVID-19 safety measure and mitigating the spread of the pandemic in Nigeria and beyond.",0,"Political distrust and the spread of COVID-19 in NigeriaWhile studies have explored how health sector corruption, weak healthcare system, large-scale immune compromised population, misinformation and prevalence of highly congested slums contribute to the spread of COVID-19 in Nigeria, they have glossed over the impact of political distrust on the spread of the virus.

As patients potentially infected by SARS-CoV-2 need to visit hospitals, the incidence of nosocomial infection can be expected to be high. Therefore, a comprehensive and objective understanding of nosocomial infection is needed to guide the prevention and control of the epidemic. Method(s): We searched major international and Chinese databases: Medicine, Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane, CBM (China Biology Medicine disc), CNKI (China National Knowledge Infrastructure) and Wanfang database for case series or case reports on nosocomial infections of COVID-19, SARS (severe acute respiratory syndromes) and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome) from their inception to March 31st, 2020. We conducted a meta-analysis of the proportion of nosocomial infection patients in the diagnosed patients, occupational distribution of nosocomial infection medical staff. Result(s): We included 40 studies. Among the confirmed patients, the proportions of nosocomial infections with early outbreaks of COVID-19, SARS, and MERS were 44.0%, 36.0%, and 56.0%, respectively. Of the confirmed patients, the medical staff and other hospital-acquired infections accounted for 33.0% and 2.0% of COVID-19 cases, 37.0% and 24.0% of SARS cases, and 19.0% and 36.0% of MERS cases, respectively. Nurses and doctors were the most affected among the infected medical staff. The mean numbers of secondary cases caused by one index patient were 29.3 and 6.3 for SARS and MERS, respectively. Conclusion(s): The proportion of nosocomial infection in patients with COVID-19 was 44% in the early outbreak. Patients attending hospitals should take personal protection.

Three hundred and forty participants were of Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) 0 (healthy)  113 were of CDR 0.5 (questionable dementia)  and 32 were of CDR 1 and 2 (including 20 Alzheimer's disease  AD). Cortical atrophy  white matter lesion  etc.  were visually assessed. We found that each part of the brain showed atrophy in older adults for CDR 0. For CDR 0.5  the relationships between MRI findings and age were weaker  and for AD  there were no such relationship. Atrophy related with dementia severity was found to be limited to the lateral and medial temporal lobes. For CDR 0.5  amygdala atrophy was the only finding indicating CDR effect but no age effect.

47747,Dynamic evaluation of lung involvement during coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) with quantitative lung CT,"PURPOSE: To identify and quantify lung changes associated with coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) with quantitative lung CT during the disease. METHODS: This retrospective study reviewed COVID-19 patients who underwent multiple chest CT scans during their disease course. Quantitative lung CT was used to determine the nature and volume of lung involvement. A semi-quantitative scoring system was also used to evaluate lung lesions. RESULTS: This study included eighteen cases (4 cases in mild type, 10 cases in moderate type, 4 cases in severe type, and without critical type cases) with confirmed COVID-19. Patients had a mean hospitalized period of 24.1 +/- 7.1 days (range: 14-38 days) and underwent an average CT scans of 3.9 +/- 1.6 (range: 2-8). The total volumes of lung abnormalities reached a peak of 8.8 +/- 4.1 days (range: 2-14 days). The ground-glass opacity (GGO) volume percentage was higher than the consolidative opacity (CO) volume percentage on the first CT examination (Z = 2.229, P = 0.026), and there was no significant difference between the GGO volume percentage and that of CO at the peak stage (Z = - 0.628, P = 0.53). The volume percentage of lung involvement identified by AI demonstrated a strong correlation with the total CT scores at each stage (r = 0.873, P = 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative lung CT can automatically identify the nature of lung involvement and quantify the dynamic changes of lung lesions on CT during COVID-19.

MRI indices which are simple enough to be applied by non-radiologists on hard copies would be of practical importance in the discrimination. We studied 45 consecutive patients (17 with MCI  25 with AD  3 with normal cognitive findings) with at least one white matter lesion (WML) on axial fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) MRI sequences. WML load was evaluated by Fazekas' scoring system; temporal lobe atrophy by interuncal distance (IUD) measurement. WML pattern had no significant discriminative value of AD and MCI. No significant correlation between periventricular/subcortical WML scores and neuropsychological test results was observed. The mean IUD was significantly smaller in patients with MCI compared to those with AD. The cut-off value of IUD was 28.3 mm with receiver operating curve (ROC) analysis.

33165,Oligomeric and fibrillar species of amyloid-beta peptides differentially affect neuronal viability.,Genetic evidence predicts a causative role for amyloid-beta (A beta) in Alzheimer's disease. Recent debate has focused on whether fibrils (amyloid) or soluble oligomers of A beta are the active species that contribute to neurodegeneration and dementia. We developed two aggregation protocols for the consistent production of stable oligomeric or fibrillar preparations of A beta-(1-42). Here we report that oligomers inhibit neuronal viability 10-fold more than fibrils and approximately 40-fold more than unaggregated peptide  with oligomeric A beta-(1-42)-induced inhibition significant at 10 nm. Under A beta-(1-42) oligomer- and fibril-forming conditions  A beta-(1-40) remains predominantly as unassembled monomer and had significantly less effect on neuronal viability than preparations of A beta-(1-42). We applied the aggregation protocols developed for wild type A beta-(1-42) to A beta-(1-42) with the Dutch (E22Q) or Arctic (E22G) mutations. Oligomeric preparations of the mutations exhibited extensive protofibril and fibril formation  respectively  but were not consistently different from wild type A beta-(1-42) in terms of inhibition of neuronal viability. However  fibrillar preparations of the mutants appeared larger and induced significantly more inhibition of neuronal viability than wild type A beta-(1-42) fibril preparations. These data demonstrate that protocols developed to produce oligomeric and fibrillar A beta-(1-42) are useful in distinguishing the structural and functional differences between A beta-(1-42) and A beta-(1-40) and genetic mutations of A beta-(1-42).,0,Oligomeric and fibrillar species of amyloid-beta peptides differentially affect neuronal viability.Genetic evidence predicts a causative role for amyloid-beta (A beta) in Alzheimer's disease.

27108,Virtual Management of Cancer Patients in the Era of COVID-19 Pandemic,"BACKGROUND: During COVID-19 pandemic, patients from distant geographical areas will be affected the most. Virtual management ""telemedicine"" has been shown to reduce health costs and improve access to care. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this survey is to report the views of oncologists on virtual management (VM) ""awareness, challenges, preferences"" and priority of prescribing anti-cancer treatments during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We created self-administrated electronic survey about VM of cancer patients during COVID-19 pandemic. We evaluated the clinical sensibility and pilot tested the instrument. We surveyed practicing oncologists using snowball sampling in the Gulf and Arab countries via emails, social media networks and sent reminders one and two weeks later using SurveyMonkey. RESULTS: We received 222 responses from validated respondents from April 2-April 22, 2020. Awareness of the virtual clinics, virtual multidisciplinary teams (MDT) and virtual prescriptions encountered in 82%, 79% and 75%, respectively. VM challenges were lack of physical exam in 60%, patient's awareness & access in 59%, lack of physical attendance of patients in 42%, IT support in 37% and safety of VM in 35%. 50% and 48% of oncologists did not prefer virtual prescription of chemotherapy and novel immunotherapy respectively, however, 85%, 74% and 57% preferred virtual prescription of hormonal, bone modifying agents and targeted therapy respectively Oncologists preferred to continue neoadjuvant, adjuvant & perioperative treatments in 83%, 83%, 80% respectively. 53% preferred to continue 1st line palliative treatment, in contrast to 20% and 30% preferred to interrupt 2nd and 3rd line palliative treatment respectively. All responders preferred oral route and 53% preferred subcutaneous (SC) route. In contrast, 87% did not prefer intravenous (IV) route. Forty six percent of oncologists responded ""definitely"" prefer to manage cancer patients virtually. CONCLUSIONS: Oncologists have high level of awareness about VM. While 2nd and 3rd line palliative treatments should be interrupted, treatments in neoadjuvant, adjuvant, peri-operative and 1st line palliative should continue. Our results confirm that oncologists' views on priority of anti-cancer treatments are consistent with evolving literature during COVID-19 pandemic. Challenges to VM should be addressed to improve the care of cancer patients.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this survey is to report the views of oncologists on virtual management (VM) ""awareness, challenges, preferences"" and priority of prescribing anti-cancer treatments during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We created self-administrated electronic survey about VM of cancer patients during COVID-19 pandemic. We evaluated the clinical sensibility and pilot tested the instrument. We surveyed practicing oncologists using snowball sampling in the Gulf and Arab countries via emails, social media networks and sent reminders one and two weeks later using SurveyMonkey. RESULTS: We received 222 responses from validated respondents from April 2-April 22, 2020. Awareness of the virtual clinics, virtual multidisciplinary teams (MDT) and virtual prescriptions encountered in 82%, 79% and 75%, respectively. VM challenges were lack of physical exam in 60%, patient's awareness & access in 59%, lack of physical attendance of patients in 42%, IT support in 37% and safety of VM in 35%. 50% and 48% of oncologists did not prefer virtual prescription of chemotherapy and novel immunotherapy respectively, however, 85%, 74% and 57% preferred virtual prescription of hormonal, bone modifying agents and targeted therapy respectively Oncologists preferred to continue neoadjuvant, adjuvant & perioperative treatments in 83%, 83%, 80% respectively. 53% preferred to continue 1st line palliative treatment, in contrast to 20% and 30% preferred to interrupt 2nd and 3rd line palliative treatment respectively. All responders preferred oral route and 53% preferred subcutaneous (SC) route. In contrast, 87% did not prefer intravenous (IV) route. Forty six percent of oncologists responded ""definitely"" prefer to manage cancer patients virtually. CONCLUSIONS: Oncologists have high level of awareness about VM. While 2nd and 3rd line palliative treatments should be interrupted, treatments in neoadjuvant, adjuvant, peri-operative and 1st line palliative should continue. Our results confirm that oncologists' views on priority of anti-cancer treatments are consistent with evolving literature during COVID-19 pandemic. Challenges to VM should be addressed to improve the care of cancer patients.

11087,A comprehensive strategy for the early treatment of COVID-19 with azithromycin/hydroxychloroquine and/or corticosteroids: Results of a retrospective observational study in the French overseas department of Reunion Island,"BACKGROUND: This study aimed to evaluate the prognosis of COVID-19 patients in Reunion Island, with a particular focus on the management of patients with hypoxemic pneumonia. METHODS: This retrospective observational study was conducted from 11 March to 17 April 2020 at the only hospital authorized to manage patients with COVID-19 in Reunion Island. RESULTS: Over the study period, 164 out of 398 patients (41.2%) infected with COVID-19 were admitted to Felix Guyon University Hospital. Of these, 36 (22%) developed hypoxemic pneumonia. Patients with hypoxemic pneumonia were aged 66 [56-77] years, 69% were male and 33% had hypertension. Ten patients (27.8%) were hospitalized in intensive care unit (ICU). Hydroxychloroquine/azithromycin treatment was associated with a lower ICU admission rate (P=0.008). None of the 6 patients treated with corticosteroids were hospitalized in ICU (P=0.16). There were no deaths at follow up (minimum 80 days). CONCLUSIONS: Despite the risk profile of COVID-19 patients with severe hypoxemic pneumonia, the mortality rate of the disease in Reunion Island was 0%. This may be due to the care bundle used in our hospital (early hospitalisation, treatment with hydroxychloroquine/azithromycin and/or corticosteroids, non-invasive respiratory support, etc).

7454,Epidemiology of and Risk Factors for Coronavirus Infection in Health Care Workers: A Living Rapid Review,"Background: Health care workers (HCWs) are at risk for severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Purpose: To examine the burden of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1, and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV on HCWs and risk factors for infection, using rapid and living review methods. Data Sources: Multiple electronic databases including the WHO Database of Publications on Coronavirus Disease and medRxiv preprint server (2003 through 27 March 2020, with ongoing surveillance through 24 April 2020), and reference lists. Study Selection: Studies published in any language reporting incidence of or outcomes associated with coronavirus infections in HCWs and studies on the association between risk factors (demographic characteristics, role, exposures, environmental and administrative factors, and personal protective equipment [PPE] use) and HCW infections. New evidence will be incorporated on an ongoing basis by using living review methods. Data Extraction: One reviewer abstracted data and assessed methodological limitations; verification was done by a second reviewer. Data Synthesis: 64 studies met inclusion criteria; 43 studies addressed burden of HCW infections (15 on SARS-CoV-2), and 34 studies addressed risk factors (3 on SARS-CoV-2). Health care workers accounted for a significant proportion of coronavirus infections and may experience particularly high infection incidence after unprotected exposures. Illness severity was lower than in non-HCWs. Depression, anxiety, and psychological distress were common in HCWs during the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak. The strongest evidence on risk factors was on PPE use and decreased infection risk. The association was most consistent for masks but was also observed for gloves, gowns, eye protection, and handwashing; evidence suggested a dose-response relationship. No study evaluated PPE reuse. Certain exposures (such as involvement in intubations, direct patient contact, or contact with bodily secretions) were associated with increased infection risk. Infection control training was associated with decreased risk. Limitation: There were few studies on risk factors for SARS-CoV-2, the studies had methodological limitations, and streamlined rapid review methods were used.

FAD-linked mutant PS1s significantly increased Abeta40 and Abeta42(43) levels (P < 0.001) and decreased the production of an 11.4 kD (beta-stub) and an 8.7 kD (alpha-stub) carboxyl-terminal fragment of amyloid beta precursor protein (betaAPP-CTFs) (P < 0.01). In the 2% CHAPS extracted lysates  the complex containing the amino-terminal fragment of PS1 (PS1-NTF)  the carboxyl-terminal fragments of PS1 (PS1-CTF)  and betaAPP-CTFs was identified. Incubation of this isolated complex at pH 6.4 showed the direct generation of Abeta40 and gamma-stub from this complex. This reaction was inhibited by a gamma-secretase inhibitor. The degrading rate of a co-precipitated beta-stub was facilitated under the presence of FAD-linked mutant PS1s. This findings suggest that the direct generation of Abeta from the complex may play an important role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.,0,Generation of amyloid beta protein from a presenilin-1 and betaAPP complex.Presenilin-1 (PS1) is a causative gene in early onset familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD).

65345,In vitro streptozotocin model for modeling Alzheimer-like changes: effect on amyloid precursor protein secretases and glycogen synthase kinase-3.,There is accumulating evidence for a pathogenetic link between sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD) and diabetes mellitus (DM). At subdiabetogenic doses  the cerebral administration of the diabetogenic substance streptozotocin (STZ) induces an insulin-resistant brain state (IRBS). The aim of the present pilot study was to investigate the effect of STZ on Alzheimer-like characteristics such as amyloid precursor protein (APP) cleavage secretases  betaA4 fragment  and glycogen synthase kinase (GSK) in vitro. Different STZ concentrations (0-5 mM) and incubation intervals (0-48 h) were tested to find appropriate cell culture conditions for further biochemical analyses in human neuroblastoma cells (SK-N-MC). Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was measured spectrophotometrically. Intracellular ATP was determined using bioluminescent luciferase assay. Secretase activity (alpha  beta  and gamma) was measured by employing commercial fluorometric secretase activity assay kits  betaA4 fragment by immunoprecipitation. Glycogen synthase kinase-3alpha/beta (total and phospho-GSK) content was assayed by ELISA technique. In vitro STZ administration (1 mM) induced a significant reduction in intracellular ATP concentration without pronounced cell death after 24 and 48 h as measured by LDH. Under these experimental conditions  a significant increase in beta-secretase and a significant drop in alpha-secretase were obtained  whereas gamma-secretase was not changed significantly. Simultaneously  the betaA4 concentration was increased by about threefold. Furthermore  STZ significantly increased total GSK and markedly decreased phospho-GSK. A direct link between STZ  intracellular ATP deficit  and Alzheimer-related enzymes was shown in this in vitro pilot study. Thus  these results support the hypothesis that sporadic AD is being recognized as an IRBS  which can be modulated by in vitro STZ model. Continuing investigations relating pathogenetic mechanisms and AD-like hallmarks are necessary to modulate different cascades of the IRBS using in vitro models.,0,In vitro streptozotocin model for modeling Alzheimer-like changes: effect on amyloid precursor protein secretases and glycogen synthase kinase-3.There is accumulating evidence for a pathogenetic link between sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD) and diabetes mellitus (DM).

The spread of SARS-CoV-2 has been faster than any other coronaviruses that have succeeded in crossing the animal-human barrier. There is concern that this new virus will spread around the world as did the previous two HCoVs-Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)-each of which caused approximately 800 deaths in the years 2002 and 2012, respectively. Thus far, 11,268 deaths have been reported from the 258,842 confirmed infections in 168 countries. MAIN METHODS: In this study, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of the newly emerged coronavirus is modeled, validated, and then targeted using different anti-polymerase drugs currently on the market that have been approved for use against various viruses. KEY FINDINGS: The results suggest the effectiveness of Ribavirin, Remdesivir, Sofosbuvir, Galidesivir, and Tenofovir as potent drugs against SARS-CoV-2 since they tightly bind to its RdRp. In addition, the results suggest guanosine derivative (IDX-184), Setrobuvir, and YAK as top seeds for antiviral treatments with high potential to fight the SARS-CoV-2 strain specifically.

45060,Anticoagulation use and Hemorrhagic Stroke in SARS-CoV-2 Patients Treated at a New York Healthcare System,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: While the thrombotic complications of COVID-19 have been well described, there are limited data on clinically significant bleeding complications including hemorrhagic stroke. The clinical characteristics, underlying stroke mechanism, and outcomes in this particular subset of patients are especially salient as therapeutic anticoagulation becomes increasingly common in the treatment and prevention of thrombotic complications of COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients with hemorrhagic stroke (both non-traumatic intracerebral hemorrhage and spontaneous non-aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage) who were hospitalized between March 1, 2020, and May 15, 2020, within a major healthcare system in New York, during the coronavirus pandemic. Patients with hemorrhagic stroke on admission and who developed hemorrhage during hospitalization were both included. We compared the clinical characteristics of patients with hemorrhagic stroke and COVID-19 to those without COVID-19 admitted to our hospital system between March 1, 2020, and May 15, 2020 (contemporary controls), and March 1, 2019, and May 15, 2019 (historical controls). Demographic variables and clinical characteristics between the individual groups were compared using Fischer's exact test for categorical variables and nonparametric test for continuous variables. We adjusted for multiple comparisons using the Bonferroni method. RESULTS: During the study period in 2020, out of 4071 patients who were hospitalized with COVID-19, we identified 19 (0.5%) with hemorrhagic stroke. Of all COVID-19 with hemorrhagic stroke, only three had isolated non-aneurysmal SAH with no associated intraparenchymal hemorrhage. Among hemorrhagic stroke in patients with COVID-19, coagulopathy was the most common etiology (73.7%); empiric anticoagulation was started in 89.5% of these patients versus 4.2% in contemporary controls (p <= .001) and 10.0% in historical controls (p <= .001). Compared to contemporary and historical controls, patients with COVID-19 had higher initial NIHSS scores, INR, PTT, and fibrinogen levels. Patients with COVID-19 also had higher rates of in-hospital mortality (84.6% vs. 4.6%, p <= 0.001). Sensitivity analyses excluding patients with strictly subarachnoid hemorrhage yielded similar results. CONCLUSION: We observed an overall low rate of imaging-confirmed hemorrhagic stroke among patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Most hemorrhages in patients with COVID-19 infection occurred in the setting of therapeutic anticoagulation and were associated with increased mortality. Further studies are needed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of therapeutic anticoagulation in patients with COVID-19.",0,"Anticoagulation use and Hemorrhagic Stroke in SARS-CoV-2 Patients Treated at a New York Healthcare SystemBACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: While the thrombotic complications of COVID-19 have been well described, there are limited data on clinically significant bleeding complications including hemorrhagic stroke.

We compared the clinical characteristics of patients with hemorrhagic stroke and COVID-19 to those without COVID-19 admitted to our hospital system between March 1, 2020, and May 15, 2020 (contemporary controls), and March 1, 2019, and May 15, 2019 (historical controls). Demographic variables and clinical characteristics between the individual groups were compared using Fischer's exact test for categorical variables and nonparametric test for continuous variables. We adjusted for multiple comparisons using the Bonferroni method. RESULTS: During the study period in 2020, out of 4071 patients who were hospitalized with COVID-19, we identified 19 (0.5%) with hemorrhagic stroke. Of all COVID-19 with hemorrhagic stroke, only three had isolated non-aneurysmal SAH with no associated intraparenchymal hemorrhage. Among hemorrhagic stroke in patients with COVID-19, coagulopathy was the most common etiology (73.7%); empiric anticoagulation was started in 89.5% of these patients versus 4.2% in contemporary controls (p <= .001) and 10.0% in historical controls (p <= .001). Compared to contemporary and historical controls, patients with COVID-19 had higher initial NIHSS scores, INR, PTT, and fibrinogen levels. Patients with COVID-19 also had higher rates of in-hospital mortality (84.6% vs. 4.6%, p <= 0.001). Sensitivity analyses excluding patients with strictly subarachnoid hemorrhage yielded similar results. CONCLUSION: We observed an overall low rate of imaging-confirmed hemorrhagic stroke among patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Most hemorrhages in patients with COVID-19 infection occurred in the setting of therapeutic anticoagulation and were associated with increased mortality. Further studies are needed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of therapeutic anticoagulation in patients with COVID-19.","{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 445}",1,"{'judgement': 'False', 'index': 445}",0,"{'judgement': 'False', 'index': 445}",0,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 445}",1,"{'judgement': 'False', 'index': 445}",0

Their accuracy is unknown, which could affect downstream analyses. Objective: To compare the performance of fever-, cough-, and dyspnea-specific ICD-10 codes with medical record review among patients tested for COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study included patients who underwent quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 at University of Utah Health from March 10 to April 6, 2020. Data analysis was performed in April 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures: The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of ICD-10 codes for fever (R50*), cough (R05*), and dyspnea (R06.0*) were compared with manual medical record review. Performance was calculated overall and stratified by COVID-19 test result, sex, age group (<50, 50-64, and >64 years), and inpatient status. Bootstrapping was used to generate 95% CIs, and Pearson chi2 tests were used to compare different subgroups. Results: Among 2201 patients tested for COVD-19, the mean (SD) age was 42 (17) years; 1201 (55%) were female, 1569 (71%) were White, and 282 (13%) were Hispanic or Latino. The prevalence of fever was 66% (1444 patients), that of cough was 88% (1930 patients), and that of dyspnea was 64% (1399 patients). For fever, the sensitivity of ICD-10 codes was 0.26 (95% CI, 0.24-0.29), specificity was 0.98 (95% CI, 0.96-0.99), PPV was 0.96 (95% CI, 0.93-0.97), and NPV was 0.41 (95% CI, 0.39-0.43).

METHODS: 127 consecutive hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 were enrolled in this study, and classified into non-severe and severe groups. Demographics, symptoms, underlying diseases and laboratory data were collected and assessed for predictive value. RESULTS: Of 127 COVID-19 patients, 16 cases (12.60%) were classified into the severe group. High level of interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reaction protein (CRP) and hypertension were independent risk factors for the severity of COVID-19. The risk model based on IL-6, CRP and hypertension had the highest area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUROC). Additionally, the baseline IL-6 was positively correlated with other immune-inflammatory parameters and the dynamic change of IL-6 in the severe cases were parallel to the amelioration of the disease. CONCLUSION: Our study showed that high level of IL-6, CRP and hypertension were independent risk factors for assessing the severity of COVID-19.

58272,COVID-19 coagulopathy: an in-depth analysis of the coagulation system,"BACKGROUND: Abnormal coagulation parameters have been reported in COVID-19 patients. Although the underlying mechanism of COVID-19 coagulopathy remains unknown, it has been suggested to be a form of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). OBJECTIVES: The aim of our study was to analyze the coagulation parameters of patients with COVID-19, determine if coagulation factors consumption occurs and identify potential prognostic biomarkers of the disease. PATIENTS/METHODS: Blood samples from hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were collected. We performed basic coagulation tests and quantification of coagulation factors and physiological inhibitor proteins. Laboratory data were compared with clinical data and outcomes. RESULTS: The study involved 206 patients (63.6% male). D-dimer was particularly elevated (median 450 ng/ml; IQR 222.5-957.3). Free protein S levels were below the normal range (median 56.6%; IQR: 43.6-68.9) and factor VIII showed an increasing trend (median 173.4%; IQR: 144.1-214.9). However, all coagulation factors were within normal limits. We found no correlation between abnormal coagulation parameters and thrombosis, except for higher D-dimer (HR 1.99; 95% CI 1.3-3.1; p=0.002). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 is associated with coagulopathy that correlates with poor prognosis. However, we did not demonstrate a consumption of coagulation factors, as seen in DIC.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of our study was to analyze the coagulation parameters of patients with COVID-19, determine if coagulation factors consumption occurs and identify potential prognostic biomarkers of the disease. PATIENTS/METHODS: Blood samples from hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were collected. We performed basic coagulation tests and quantification of coagulation factors and physiological inhibitor proteins. Laboratory data were compared with clinical data and outcomes. RESULTS: The study involved 206 patients (63.6% male). D-dimer was particularly elevated (median 450 ng/ml; IQR 222.5-957.3). Free protein S levels were below the normal range (median 56.6%; IQR: 43.6-68.9) and factor VIII showed an increasing trend (median 173.4%; IQR: 144.1-214.9). However, all coagulation factors were within normal limits. We found no correlation between abnormal coagulation parameters and thrombosis, except for higher D-dimer (HR 1.99; 95% CI 1.3-3.1; p=0.002). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 is associated with coagulopathy that correlates with poor prognosis. However, we did not demonstrate a consumption of coagulation factors, as seen in DIC.

48980,Distinct cerebral perfusion patterns in FTLD and AD.,OBJECTIVE: We examined the utility of distinguishing between patients with frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and Alzheimer disease (AD) using quantitative cerebral blood flow (CBF) imaging with arterial spin labeled (ASL) perfusion MRI. METHODS: Forty-two patients with FTLD and 18 patients with AD  defined by autopsy or CSF-derived biomarkers for AD  and 23 matched controls were imaged with a continuous ASL method to quantify CBF maps covering the entire brain. RESULTS: Patients with FTLD and AD showed distinct patterns of hypoperfusion and hyperperfusion. Compared with controls  patients with FTLD showed significant hypoperfusion in regions of the frontal lobe bilaterally  and hyperperfusion in posterior cingulate and medial parietal/precuneus regions. Compared with controls  patients with AD showed significant hypoperfusion in the medial parietal/precuneus and lateral parietal cortex  and hyperperfusion in regions of the frontal lobe. Direct comparison of patient groups showed significant inferior  medial  and dorsolateral frontal hypoperfusion in FTLD  and significant hypoperfusion in bilateral lateral temporal-parietal and medial parietal/precuneus regions in AD. CONCLUSIONS: Doubly dissociated areas of hypoperfusion in FTLD and AD are consistent with areas of significant histopathologic burden in these groups. ASL is a potentially useful biomarker for distinguishing patients with these neurodegenerative diseases.,0,Distinct cerebral perfusion patterns in FTLD and AD.OBJECTIVE: We examined the utility of distinguishing between patients with frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and Alzheimer disease (AD) using quantitative cerebral blood flow (CBF) imaging with arterial spin labeled (ASL) perfusion MRI.

28375,Proteomic and functional alterations in brain mitochondria from Tg2576 mice occur before amyloid plaque deposition.,Synaptic dysfunction is an early event in Alzheimer's disease patients and has also been detected in transgenic mouse models. In the present study  we analyzed proteomic changes in synaptosomal fractions from Tg2576 mice that overexpress mutant human amyloid precursor protein (K670N  M671L) and from their nontransgenic littermates. Cortical and hippocampal tissue was microdissected at the onset of cognitive impairment  but before deposition of amyloid plaques. Crude synaptosomal fractions were prepared by differential centrifugation  proteins were separated by 2-D DIGE and identified by MS/MS. Significant alterations were detected in mitochondrial heat shock protein 70 pointing to a mitochondrial stress response. Subsequently  synaptosomal versus nonsynaptic mitochondria were purified from Tg2576 mice brains by density gradient centrifugation. Mitochondrial proteins were separated by IEF or Blue-native gel electrophoresis in the first dimension and SDS-PAGE in the second dimension. Numerous changes in the protein subunit composition of the respiratory chain complexes I and III were identified. Levels of corresponding mRNAs remain unchanged as shown by Affymetrix oligonucleotide array analysis. Functional examination revealed impaired state 3 respiration and uncoupled respiration in brain mitochondria from young Tg2576 mice. By immunoblotting  amyloid-beta oligomers were detected in synaptosomal fractions from Tg2576 mice and reduced glucose metabolism was observed in Tg2576 mice brains by [14C]-2-deoxyglucose infusion. Taken together  we demonstrate alterations in the mitochondrial proteome and function that occur in Tg2576 mice brains before amyloid plaque deposition suggesting that mitochondria are early targets of amyloid-beta aggregates.,0,Proteomic and functional alterations in brain mitochondria from Tg2576 mice occur before amyloid plaque deposition.Synaptic dysfunction is an early event in Alzheimer's disease patients and has also been detected in transgenic mouse models.

45358,Discordance between Serum Neutralizing Antibody Titers and the Recovery from COVID-19,"The recent pandemic of COVID-19 has caused a tremendous alarm around the world. Details of the infection process in the host have significant bearings on both recovery from the disease and on the correlates of the protection from the future exposures. One of these factors is the presence and titers of neutralizing Abs (NAbs) in infected people. In the current study, we set out to investigate NAbs in the recovered subjects discharged from the hospital in full health. Serum samples from a total of 49 documented consecutive COVID-19 subjects were included in the study. All the subjects were adults, and serum samples collected during the discharge were tested in viral neutralization, enzyme immunoassay (EIA), and Western immunoblot tests against viral Ags. Even though a majority of the recovered subjects had raised significant NAb titers, there is a substantial number of recovered patients (10 out of 49) with no or low titers of NAbs against the virus. In these cohorts as well as in patients with high NAb titers, viral Ag binding Abs were detectable in EIA tests. Both NAb titers and EIA detectable Abs are increased in patients experiencing a severe form of the disease, and in older patients the Ab titers were heightened. The main conclusion is that the recovery from SARS-CoV-2 infection is not solely dependent on high NAb titers in affected subjects, and this recovery process is probably produced by a complex interplay between many factors, including immune response, age of the subjects, and viral pathology.

27218,An Illustration of SARS-CoV-2 Dissemination Within a Skilled Nursing Facility Using Heat Maps,"OBJECTIVES: To illustrate dissemination and asymptomatic transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) during a skilled nursing facility (SNF) outbreak. DESIGN: Case report. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Residents of a 150-bed SNF. MEASUREMENTS: Heat maps generated by the SNF's infection prevention team to track staff and resident symptoms and SARS-CoV-2 test results to identify infection patterns. RESULTS: The SNF experienced a severe outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 early in the pandemic. The initial cluster of residents with symptoms and the first confirmed case occurred on the SNF's dementia care unit. The insufficient availability and prolonged turnaround time of testing for both residents and staff at the outset of the outbreak prevented timely and accurate identification and cohorting of cases. Despite extensive other infection control measures being in place, SARS-CoV-2 disseminated widely through the facility within 3 weeks of the first confirmed case, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. CONCLUSION: Early, rapid, universal SARS-CoV-2 testing of both SNF residents and staff at the outset of an outbreak and then repeatedly thereafter is critical to mitigate viral transmission. This will become even more important as states relax stay-at-home orders and SNF staff intermingle with communities that are increasingly mobile. Increased testing will inevitably result in more staff testing positive and having to self-quarantine at home, meaning that states must partner with SNFs and other long-term care providers to coordinate and support strategic staffing reserves that can supplement current frontline staff.

Some decline rapidly whereas others decline slowly  and there are no known explanations for this variability. We describe the first genome-wide association study to examine rate of cognitive decline in a sample of AD patients with longitudinal measures of cognition. METHODS: The discovery sample was 303 AD cases recruited in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative and the replication sample was 323 AD cases from the Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project. In the discovery sample  Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale responses were tested for association with genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data using linear regression. We tested the 65 most significant SNPs from the discovery sample for association in the replication sample. RESULTS: We identified SNPs in the spondin 1 gene (SPON1)  the minor alleles of which were significantly associated with a slower rate of decline (rs11023139  PEEE=EEE7.0EEEEEEEEE10(-11)) in the discovery sample. A SPON1 SNP 5.5 kb upstream was associated with decline in the replication sample (rs11606345  P = .002). CONCLUSION: SPON1 has not been previously associated with AD risk  but is plausibly related because the gene product binds to the amyloid precursor protein and inhibits its cleavage by EEE-secretase.

57990,Positional effects of presenilin-1 mutations on tau phosphorylation in cortical plaques.,Mutations in presenilin-1 (PS-1) account for the majority of familial Alzheimer's disease (AD). While increasing Abeta42 is one mechanism whereby PS-1 mutations are thought to exert their pathogenic effect  little is known about the role of tau in PS-1 AD. This study compares staining (AT8 and tau-2)  morphology and quantity of tau-immunoreactive cortical plaques in six PS-1 and five sporadic AD cases. The densities of tau-positive plaques differentiated PS-1 from sporadic AD cases. All PS-1 cases demonstrated a greater than 6-fold increase in tau-2-positive plaques. In PS-1 cases with mutations in exons 5 and 6  there was an increase in classical AD plaques containing hyperphosphorylated tau (AT8- and tau 2-positive). However  cases with exon 8 and 9 mutations had numerous cotton wool plaques containing nonhyperphosphorylated tau (tau-2-positive  AT8-negative). These findings suggest that PS-1 mutations increase tau deposition while mutation-specific cellular responses determine phosphorylation events and may influence cell death mechanisms.,0,Positional effects of presenilin-1 mutations on tau phosphorylation in cortical plaques.Mutations in presenilin-1 (PS-1) account for the majority of familial Alzheimer's disease (AD). While increasing Abeta42 is one mechanism whereby PS-1 mutations are thought to exert their pathogenic effect  little is known about the role of tau in PS-1 AD. This study compares staining (AT8 and tau-2)  morphology and quantity of tau-immunoreactive cortical plaques in six PS-1 and five sporadic AD cases. The densities of tau-positive plaques differentiated PS-1 from sporadic AD cases. All PS-1 cases demonstrated a greater than 6-fold increase in tau-2-positive plaques. In PS-1 cases with mutations in exons 5 and 6  there was an increase in classical AD plaques containing hyperphosphorylated tau (AT8- and tau 2-positive). However  cases with exon 8 and 9 mutations had numerous cotton wool plaques containing nonhyperphosphorylated tau (tau-2-positive  AT8-negative).

26663,Preliminary estimation of temporal and spatiotemporal dynamic measures of COVID- 19 transmission in Thailand,"Background As a new emerging infectious disease pandemic, there is an urgent need to understand the dynamics of COVID-19 in each country to inform planning of emergency measures to contain its spread. It is essential that appropriate disease control activities are planned and implemented in a timely manner. Thailand was one of the first countries outside China to be affected with subsequent importation and domestic spread in most provinces in the country. Method A key ingredient to guide planning and implementation of public health measures is a metric of transmissibility which represents the infectiousness of a disease. Ongoing policies can utilize this information to plan appropriately with updated estimates of disease transmissibility. Therefore we present descriptive analyses and preliminary statistical estimation of reproduction numbers over time and space to facilitate disease control activities in Thailand. Results The estimated basic reproduction number for COVID-19 during the study ranged from 2.23- 5.90, with a mean of 3.75. We also tracked disease dynamics over time using temporal and spatiotemporal reproduction numbers. The results suggest that the outbreak was under control since the middle of April. After the boxing stadium and entertainment venues, the numbers of new cases had increased and spread across the country. Discussion Although various scenarios about assumptions were explored in this study, the real situation was difficult to determine given the limited data. More thorough mathematical modelling would be helpful to improve the estimation of transmissibility metrics for emergency preparedness as more epidemiological and clinical information about this new infection becomes available. However, the results can be used to guide interventions directly and to help parameterize models to predict the impact of these interventions.Copyright ÁE© 2020 Rotejanaprasert et al.

39547,SNAP-25 is a promising novel cerebrospinal fluid biomarker for synapse degeneration in Alzheimer's disease.,BACKGROUND: Synaptic degeneration is an early pathogenic event in Alzheimer's disease  associated with cognitive impairment and disease progression. Cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers reflecting synaptic integrity would be highly valuable tools to monitor synaptic degeneration directly in patients. We previously showed that synaptic proteins such as synaptotagmin and synaptosomal-associated protein 25 (SNAP-25) could be detected in pooled samples of cerebrospinal fluid  however these assays were not sensitive enough for individual samples. RESULTS: We report a new strategy to study synaptic pathology by using affinity purification and mass spectrometry to measure the levels of the presynaptic protein SNAP-25 in cerebrospinal fluid. By applying this novel affinity mass spectrometry strategy on three separate cohorts of patients  the value of SNAP-25 as a cerebrospinal fluid biomarker for synaptic integrity in Alzheimer's disease was assessed for the first time. We found significantly higher levels of cerebrospinal fluid SNAP-25 fragments in Alzheimer's disease  even in the very early stages  in three separate cohorts. Cerebrospinal fluid SNAP-25 differentiated Alzheimer's disease from controls with area under the curve of 0.901 (PE<E0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: We developed a sensitive method to analyze SNAP-25 levels in individual CSF samples that to our knowledge was not possible previously. Our results support the notion that synaptic biomarkers may be important tools for early diagnosis  assessment of disease progression  and to monitor drug effects in treatment trials.,0,SNAP-25 is a promising novel cerebrospinal fluid biomarker for synapse degeneration in Alzheimer's disease.BACKGROUND: Synaptic degeneration is an early pathogenic event in Alzheimer's disease  associated with cognitive impairment and disease progression.

45584,Pre-existing cerebrovascular disease and poor outcomes of COVID-19 hospitalized patients: a meta-analysis,"Background: Due to pro-inflammatory and hypercoagulation states, COVID-19 infection is believed to increase the risk of stroke and worsen the outcomes of the patients having pre-existing cerebrovascular diseases (CeVD). There is limited literature on prevalence of pre-existing CeVD in COVID-19 patients, and outcomes are unknown. The objective of this meta-analysis is to evaluate the outcomes of COVID-19 patients with pre-existing CeVD. Method(s): English full-text-observational studies having data on epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 patients were identified searching PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus using MeSH-terms COVID-19 OR coronavirus OR SARS-CoV-2 OR 2019-nCoV from December 1, 2019 to April 30, 2020. Studies having CeVD or stroke as one of the pre-existing comorbidities and described outcomes including intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation utilization, and mortality were selected with consensus of three reviewers. Following MOOSE protocol, 11 studies were included. The pooled prevalence of CeVD and outcomes were calculated. Meta-regression was performed, and correlation coefficient (r) and odds ratio (OR) were estimated to evaluate the effects of pre-existing CeVD on outcomes of COVID-19 patients. Meta-analysis with random-effects model was used to calculate OR along with its 95% CI from the studies containing data on composite poor outcome. Result(s): Out of 8/11 studies showing data on mortality and mechanical ventilation, and 7/11 on ICU admission, pooled prevalence of pre-existing CeVD was 4.4% (244/4987). In age-adjusted meta-regression analysis, pre-existing CeVD was associated with ICU admission [r: 0.60; OR: 1.82 (1.25-2.69)], mechanical ventilation [r: 0.29; OR: 1.33 (1.09-1.63)], and mortality [r: 0.35; OR: 1.42 (1.14-1.77)] amongst COVID-19 hospitalizations. 9/11 studies reported data on binary composite outcomes, the pooled prevalence of pre-existing CeVD was 4.3% (155/3603) and 7.46% (83/1113) amongst COVID-19 hospitalizations and COVID-19 hospitalization-related poor outcomes, respectively. In meta-analysis, COVID-19 patient with pre-existing CeVD had 2.67-fold (1.75-4.06) higher odds of poor outcomes.

31468,Functional neuroanatomy of the encoding and retrieval processes of verbal episodic memory in MCI.,INTRODUCTION: The goal of this study was to explore the association between disease severity and performance on brain activation associated with episodic memory encoding and retrieval in persons with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). METHOD: This was achieved by scanning 12 MCI persons and 10 age- and education-matched healthy controls while encoding words and while retrieving them in a recognition test. RESULTS: Behaviorally  there was no significant group difference on recognition performance. However  MCI and healthy controls showed different patterns of cerebral activation during encoding. While most of these differences demonstrated reduced activation in the MCI group  there were areas of increased activation in the left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex. Reduced activation was found in brain areas known to be either structurally compromised or hypometabolic in Alzheimer's disease (AD). In contrast  very few group differences were associated with retrieval. Correlation analyses indicated that increased disease severity  as measured with the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale  was associated with smaller activation of the right middle and superior temporal gyri. In contrast  recognition success in MCI persons was associated with larger activation of the left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex during the encoding phase. CONCLUSION: Overall  our results indicate that most of the memory-related cerebral network changes in MCI persons occur during the encoding phase. They also suggest that a prefrontal compensatory mechanism could occur in parallel with the disease-associated reduction of cerebral activation in temporal areas.,0,Functional neuroanatomy of the encoding and retrieval processes of verbal episodic memory in MCI.INTRODUCTION: The goal of this study was to explore the association between disease severity and performance on brain activation associated with episodic memory encoding and retrieval in persons with mild cognitive impairment (MCI).

39298,Clinical severity of Alzheimer's disease is associated with PIB uptake in PET.,BACKGROUND: The positron emission tomography (PET) tracer [11C]-Pittsburgh Compound-B ([11C]PIB) allows the in vivo assessment of amyloid plaque burden in the brain. In a cross-sectional study we examined the association between the severity of dementia assessed using the Clinical Dementia Rating scale sum of boxes (CDR-SOB) and [11C]PIB-PET in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: Patients with probable AD who had an AD-typical [18F]FDG-PET scan were included. Linear regression analysis in anatomically defined regions-of-interest (ROIs) and correlation analysis using statistical parametric mapping (SPM) were used to determine the association between CDR-SOB and [11C]PIB uptake. RESULTS: The linear regression analyses showed that the CDR-SOB explained approximately 11-22% of the variance of [11C]PIB uptake. The association attained statistical significance in both frontal  in both anterior cingulate cortices  and in both putamina. The SPM analysis showed a significant association in more widespread regions of the brain  with maxima located in similar areas as in the ROI-analysis. CONCLUSION: The CDR-SOB score is significantly associated with [11C]PIB uptake in patients with AD. Thus [11C]PIB is a potential surrogate marker of dementia severity.,0,Clinical severity of Alzheimer's disease is associated with PIB uptake in PET.BACKGROUND: The positron emission tomography (PET) tracer [11C]-Pittsburgh Compound-B ([11C]PIB) allows the in vivo assessment of amyloid plaque burden in the brain.

58816,Ulcerative colitis as a primary manifestation of Churg-Strauss syndrome,"A 29-year-old woman with chronic bronchial asthma and inflammatory bowel disease, previously classified as idiopathic, was hospitalized because of bouts of fever and increasing dyspnoea and diarrhoea. Chest radiograph showed extensive bilateral pulmonary infiltrates. Thought to be suffering from bacterial pneumonia she was treated with broad-spectrum antibiotic, but without improvement even after a change of antibiotics. Numerous diagnostic tests failed to find any causative organism. Subsequently she was found to have peripheral eosinophilia and pericardial effusion associated with echocardiographic and electrocardiographic signs of myocarditis, which raised the suspicion of allergic granulomatous vasculitis (Churg-Strauss syndrome). The patient's acute illness contraindicated a lung biopsy, but the clinical picture left no doubt of the true diagnosis. Treatment with methylprednisolone (initially 250 mg, then 80 mg daily) rapidly improved the clinical, radiological and biochemical findings.

Objective(s): We evaluated the analytical performance of two rapid nucleic acid tests, Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 and Mobidiag Novodiag Covid-19, in comparison to a combination reference of three large-scale PCR tests. Moreover, utility of the Novodiag test in tertiary care emergency departments was assessed. Result(s): In the preliminary evaluation, analysis of 90 respiratory samples resulted in 100% specificity and sensitivity for Xpert, whereas analysis of 107 samples resulted in 93.4% sensitivity and 100% specificity for Novodiag. Rapid SARS-CoV-2 testing with Novodiag was made available for four tertiary care emergency departments in Helsinki, Finland between 18 and 31 May, coinciding with a rapidly declining epidemic phase. Altogether 361 respiratory specimens, together with relevant clinical data, were analyzed with Novodiag and reference tests: 355/361 of the specimens were negative with both methods, and 1/361 was positive in Novodiag and negative by the reference method. Of the 5 remaining specimens, two were negative with Novodiag, but positive with the reference method with late Ct values. On average, a test result using Novodiag was available nearly 8 hours earlier than that obtained with the large-scale PCR tests. Conclusion(s): While the performance of novel sample-to-answer PCR tests need to be carefully evaluated, they may provide timely and reliable results in detection of SARS-CoV-2 and thus facilitate patient management including effective cohorting.Copyright ÁE© 2020 Elsevier B.V.",1,"SARS-CoV-2 sample-to-answer nucleic acid testing in a tertiary care emergency department: evaluation and utilityBackground: Rapid sample-to-answer tests for detection of SARS-CoV-2 are emerging and data on their relative performance is urgently needed.

Method/Description of case A 6 year old girl with inflammatory bowel disease, vasculitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis. She was having poor response on Infliximab suggested by increasing blood and mucus in her stool, high faecal calprotectin and positive infliximab antibodies. A planned re-evaluation endoscopy and biopsy showed no evidence of significant inflammation apart from worm infestation. On day 2, she developed severe upper abdominal pain and persistent vomiting with blood. She was kept nil orally and started on iv fluids and antiemetics. Abdominal ultrasound showed an IDH involving first (D1) and second (D2) part of duodenum with narrowing of lumen. Intravenous omeprazole and NG sucralfate were added. She looked very pale too and FBC showed drop in haemoglobin from 81 to 57 for which she required blood transfusion. Platelet count and clotting were normal.

Patients  methods: We evaluated retrospectively 42 patients with untreated prostate cancer (n = 17)  or increasing levels of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) after curative therapy (n = 25) who had been investigated by both Cho-PET/CT and WB-MRI. MRI  CT  and PET images were separately analyzed by experienced radiologists or nuclear medicine experts  followed by consensus reading. Validation was established by histology  follow-up  or consensus reading. Results: 88/103 detected lesions were considered as malignant: 44 bone metastases  22 local tumor  15 lymph node metastases  3 lung  and 3 brain metastases. One further lesion was located in the adrenal gland  which was a second tumor.

AIM: To investigate patient preferences for treatment settings in the light of the current pandemic. METHODS: Patients, who prior to the pandemic had attended two different outpatient clinics in a university hospital for their infusions or injections, were interviewed by telephone. The semi-structured interviews were analyzed using qualitative and quantitative methods. RESULTS: Out of 49 patients with either anti-inflammatory or immunoglobulin treatments (response rate: 83 %), 24 (49.0 %) switched from subcutaneous (sc) injections in the hospital to the community setting, 18 (36.7 %) from intravenous infusions (iv) in the hospital to sc administration at home and 7 (14.3 %) moved to iv at home. During the pandemic 38 (80.9 %) wanted to continue their treatment at home, but after the pandemic 22 (46.8 %) would opt to go back to the hospital. Satisfaction was high with both settings, slightly favoring drug administration in hospital.

1923,Detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus-2 in the tears of patients with Coronavirus disease 2019,"Objectives: Since there are few reports on the ocular involvement of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients, this study aimed to assess the presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the tears of patients with COVID-19. Methods: In this prospective case series, nasopharyngeal and tear sampling of 43 patients with severe COVID-19 were performed. The quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was conducted to detect SARS-CoV-2. Ocular and systemic signs and symptoms were recorded from their medical history. Results: The mean age of patients was 56 +/- 13 years. The average disease time from initiation of symptoms was 3.27 days, range: 1-7 days. Forty-one patients (95.3%) had fever at the time of sampling. Only one patient had conjunctivitis. Thirty (69.8%) nasopharyngeal and three (7%) tear samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2. The result of tear sample was positive in the patient with conjunctivitis. All patients with positive tear RT-PCR results had positive nasopharyngeal RT-PCR results. Conclusions: Ocular manifestation was rare in this series of severe COVID-19 patients, however, 7% of the patients had viral RNA in their conjunctival secretions.

61997,Synthea TM Novel coronavirus (COVID-19) model and synthetic data set,"March through May 2020, a model of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) disease progression and treatment was constructed for the open-source Synthea patient simulation. The model was constructed using three peer-reviewed publications published in the early stages of the global pandemic, when less was known, along with emerging resources, data, publications, and clinical knowledge. The simulation outputs synthetic Electronic Health Records (EHR), including the daily consumption of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and other medical devices and supplies. For this simulation, we generated 124,150 synthetic patients, with 88,166 infections and 18,177 hospitalized patients. Patient symptoms, disease severity, and morbidity outcomes were calibrated using clinical data from the peer-reviewed publications. 4.1% of all simulated infected patients died and 20.6% were hospitalized. At peak observation, 548 dialysis machines and 209 mechanical ventilators were needed. This simulation and the resulting data have been used for the development of algorithms and prototypes designed to address the current or future pandemics, and the model can continue to be refined to incorporate emerging COVID-19 knowledge, variations in patterns of care, and improvement in clinical outcomes. The resulting model, data, and analysis are available as open-source code on GitHub and an open-access data set is available for download.

53157,COVID-19 with rheumatic diseases: a report of 5 cases,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the result of an infection with the new virus, SARS-CoV-2, is rapidly spreading worldwide. It is largely unknown whether the occurrence of COVID-19 in patients with rheumatic immune diseases has some specific manifestations, or makes them more prone to rapidly progress into severe COVID-19. In this case report, we describe the clinical features of 5 rheumatic immune disease patients with the concomitant presence of COVID-19. Amongst these patients, 4 had rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and 1 had systemic sclerosis (SSc). Two patients had a history of close contact with a COVID-19 patient. The age of the patients ranged between 51 and 79 years. Fever (80%), cough (80%), dyspnea (40%), and fatigue (20%) were the most common presenting symptoms. Laboratory investigations revealed leukopenia and lymphopenia in 2 patients. In all the patients, chest computerized tomography (CT) revealed patchy ground glass opacities in the lungs. During the hospital stay, the condition of two patients remained the same (i.e., mild COVID-19), two patients progressed to the severe COVID-19, and one patient worsened to the critically ill COVID-19. These patients were treated with antiviral agents for COVID-19, antibiotics for secondary bacterial infections, and immunomodulatory agents for rheumatic immune diseases.

Ninety-five patients with histologically confirmed diagnosis of CNS tumours were imaged 2-4 and 24 h after the intravenous injection of 111-185 MBq of 111In-octreotide. An uptake index was computed using tumour/non-tumour ratios evaluated using a standard region-of-interest method. Semi-quantitative immunohistochemical studies of SS binding sites were performed on frozen tumour sections. All meningiomas  most pituitary adenomas and many glial tumours showed a positive scan  whereas all neurinomas  craniopharingiomas and ependymomas had negative receptor scans. Radio-octreotide uptake varied among the SS receptor positive CNS tumours: very intense in meningioma  intermediate in pituitary adenoma and of a low grade in glioma. The results of immunohistochemical studies confirmed the scintigraphic findings in all cases. We believe 111In-octreotide is a suitable radiopharmaceutical for characterizing CNS tumours in vivo as SS receptor positive or negative.

Herein we report that increased miR-342-5p down-regulates the expression of ankyrin G (AnkG)  a protein known to play a critical role in establishing selective filtering machinery at the axon initial segment (AIS). Diminished AnkG expression leads to defective AIS filtering in cultured hippocampal neurons from AD mouse models  as monitored by selective exclusion of large macromolecules from the axons. Furthermore  AnkG-deficiency impairs AIS localization of Nav 1.6 channels and confines NR2B to the somatodendritic compartments.

METHODS: From December 1997 to March 2000  SRS was performed both before and within 1 year of radiosurgery on 12 patients. Semi-quantitative data were calculated as SRS index; the index decrease was arbitrarily considered significant above 10%. A potential correlation between the decrease in post/pre-GK SRS index and radiosurgical outcome was evaluated. RESULTS: The follow-up period was at least 30 months in the whole series (median  43 months). In all 12 patients  the pre-GK SRS index was always >1  averaging 3.73+/-2.9. A decrease in the post-GK average SRS index (2.35+/-1.5) was observed. The difference between the pre- and post-GK average values was statistically significant (p<0.03). At the 1st high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) follow-up within 1 year of GK  there was no tumor shrinkage in any of the 12 patients of our series. A post/pre-GK SRS index decrease >10% was observed in 9 patients and <10% in 3. Delayed MRI follow-up documented tumor reduction in all 9 cases having an 111In uptake decrease >10%  with stable imaging in the others (p=0.00024). CONCLUSION: Our preliminary findings suggest a prognostic correlation between a decrease in concentration of somatostatin receptors on meningioma cells within 1 year of radiosurgery and delayed meningioma shrinkage,0,111Indium-octreotide brain scintigraphy: a prognostic factor in skull base meningiomas treated with gamma knife radiosurgeryAIM: The purpose of this study is to prospectively investigate the prognostic role of somatostatin receptor scintigraphy (SRS) using an 111Indium-labelled somatostatin analogue  Octreotide  in skull base meningiomas (SBMs) treated with gamma knife (GK) radiosurgery.

41442,Brain-derived neurotrophic factor is associated with age-related decline in hippocampal volume.,Hippocampal volume shrinks in late adulthood  but the neuromolecular factors that trigger hippocampal decay in aging humans remains a matter of speculation. In rodents  brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) promotes the growth and proliferation of cells in the hippocampus and is important in long-term potentiation and memory formation. In humans  circulating levels of BDNF decline with advancing age  and a genetic polymorphism for BDNF has been related to gray matter volume loss in old age. In this study  we tested whether age-related reductions in serum levels of BDNF would be related to shrinkage of the hippocampus and memory deficits in older adults. Hippocampal volume was acquired by automated segmentation of magnetic resonance images in 142 older adults without dementia. The caudate nucleus was also segmented and examined in relation to levels of serum BDNF. Spatial memory was tested using a paradigm in which memory load was parametrically increased. We found that increasing age was associated with smaller hippocampal volumes  reduced levels of serum BDNF  and poorer memory performance. Lower levels of BDNF were associated with smaller hippocampi and poorer memory  even when controlling for the variation related to age. In an exploratory mediation analysis  hippocampal volume mediated the age-related decline in spatial memory and BDNF mediated the age-related decline in hippocampal volume. Caudate nucleus volume was unrelated to BDNF levels or spatial memory performance. Our results identify serum BDNF as a significant factor related to hippocampal shrinkage and memory decline in late adulthood.,0,Brain-derived neurotrophic factor is associated with age-related decline in hippocampal volume.Hippocampal volume shrinks in late adulthood  but the neuromolecular factors that trigger hippocampal decay in aging humans remains a matter of speculation.

We investigated the presence of tau hyperphosphorylation and its relationship with neuronal and axonal loss in chronic experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (CEAE) and in brain samples from patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis. We report the novel finding of abnormal tau phosphorylation in CEAE.

55985,Immunomodulatory-based therapy as a potential promising treatment strategy against severe COVID-19 patients: A systematic review,"The global panic of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) triggered by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to an urgent requirement for effective therapy. COVID-19 infection, especially in severely ill patients, is likely to be associated with immune dysregulation, prompting the development of novel treatment approaches. Therefore, this systematic review was designed to assess the available data regarding the efficacy of the immunomodulatory drugs used to manage COVID-19. A systematic literature search was carried out up to May 27, 2020, in four databases (PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Embase) and also Clinicaltrials.gov. Sixty-six publications and 111 clinical trials were recognized as eligible, reporting the efficacy of the immunomodulatory agents, including corticosteroids, hydroxychloroquine, passive and cytokine-targeted therapies, mesenchymal stem cells, and blood-purification therapy, in COVID-19 patients. The data were found to be heterogeneous, and the clinical trials were yet to post any findings. Medicines were found to regulate the immune system by boosting the innate responses or suppressing the inflammatory reactions. Passive and cytokine-targeted therapies and mesenchymal stem cells were mostly safe and could regulate the disease much better. These studies underscored the significance of severity profiling in COVID-19 patients, along with appropriate timing, duration, and dosage of the therapies.

All rights reserved.",0,"Immunomodulatory-based therapy as a potential promising treatment strategy against severe COVID-19 patients: A systematic reviewThe global panic of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) triggered by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to an urgent requirement for effective therapy. COVID-19 infection, especially in severely ill patients, is likely to be associated with immune dysregulation, prompting the development of novel treatment approaches. Therefore, this systematic review was designed to assess the available data regarding the efficacy of the immunomodulatory drugs used to manage COVID-19. A systematic literature search was carried out up to May 27, 2020, in four databases (PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Embase) and also Clinicaltrials.gov. Sixty-six publications and 111 clinical trials were recognized as eligible, reporting the efficacy of the immunomodulatory agents, including corticosteroids, hydroxychloroquine, passive and cytokine-targeted therapies, mesenchymal stem cells, and blood-purification therapy, in COVID-19 patients. The data were found to be heterogeneous, and the clinical trials were yet to post any findings. Medicines were found to regulate the immune system by boosting the innate responses or suppressing the inflammatory reactions. Passive and cytokine-targeted therapies and mesenchymal stem cells were mostly safe and could regulate the disease much better. These studies underscored the significance of severity profiling in COVID-19 patients, along with appropriate timing, duration, and dosage of the therapies. Therefore, this review indicates that immunomodulatory therapies are potentially effective for COVID-19 and provides comprehensive information for clinicians to fight this outbreak. However, there is no consensus on the optimal therapy for COVID-19, reflecting that the immunomodulatory therapies still warrant further investigations. Copyright ÁE© 2020 Elsevier B.V.

To assess the frontal lobe functions of subjects with MCI using the Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB) and to identify the brain regions responsible for FAB performance. METHODS: Based on the FAB score cut-off of 12/13  38 MCI subjects were divided into a high FAB group (n=20) and a low FAB group (n=18). They underwent single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and we analyzed the data by the 3-D stereotactic surface projection method. RESULTS: No significant differences in neuropsychological tests including memory  language and praxis  and depression scores were found between high and low FAB groups. Although both groups showed decreases in the regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) of the parietotemporal and frontal regions  the low FAB group demonstrated significant decreases in the rCBF of the left lateral frontal and right medial frontal regions compared with the high FAB group.

61620,Glucose metabolism during resting state reveals abnormal brain networks organization in the Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment.,This paper aims to study the abnormal patterns of brain glucose metabolism co-variations in Alzheimer disease (AD) and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) patients compared to Normal healthy controls (NC) using the Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. The local cerebral metabolic rate for glucose (CMRgl) in a set of 90 structures belonging to the AAL atlas was obtained from Fluro-Deoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography data in resting state. It is assumed that brain regions whose CMRgl values are significantly correlated are functionally associated; therefore  when metabolism is altered in a single region  the alteration will affect the metabolism of other brain areas with which it interrelates. The glucose metabolism network (represented by the matrix of the CMRgl co-variations among all pairs of structures) was studied using the graph theory framework. The highest concurrent fluctuations in CMRgl were basically identified between homologous cortical regions in all groups. Significant differences in CMRgl co-variations in AD and MCI groups as compared to NC were found. The AD and MCI patients showed aberrant patterns in comparison to NC subjects  as detected by global and local network properties (global and local efficiency  clustering index  and others). MCI network's attributes showed an intermediate position between NC and AD  corroborating it as a transitional stage from normal aging to Alzheimer disease.

567,Survival-Convolution Models for Predicting COVID-19 Cases and Assessing Effects of Mitigation Strategies,"Countries around the globe have implemented unprecedented measures to mitigate the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. We aim to predict COVID-19 disease course and compare effectiveness of mitigation measures across countries to inform policy decision making. We propose a robust and parsimonious survival-convolution model for predicting key statistics of COVID-19 epidemics (daily new cases). We account for transmission during a pre-symptomatic incubation period and use a time-varying effective reproduction number (R t ) to reflect the temporal trend of transmission and change in response to a public health intervention. We estimate the intervention effect on reducing the infection rate and quantify uncertainty by permutation. In China and South Korea, we predicted the entire disease epidemic using only data in the early phase (two to three weeks after the outbreak). A fast rate of decline in R t was observed and adopting mitigation strategies early in the epidemic was effective in reducing the infection rate in these two countries. The lockdown in Italy did not further accelerate the speed at which the infection rate decreases. The effective reproduction number has staggered around R t = 1.0 for more than 2 weeks before decreasing to below 1.0, and the epidemic in Italy is currently under control. In the US, R t significantly decreased during a 2-week period after the declaration of national emergency, but afterwards the rate of decrease is substantially slower. If the trend continues after May 1, the first wave of COVID-19 may be controlled by July 26 (CI: July 9 to August 27). However, a loss of temporal effect on infection rate (e.g., due to relaxing mitigation measures after May 1) could lead to a long delay in controlling the epidemic (November 19 with less than 100 daily cases) and a total of more than 2 million cases.",0,"Survival-Convolution Models for Predicting COVID-19 Cases and Assessing Effects of Mitigation StrategiesCountries around the globe have implemented unprecedented measures to mitigate the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.

23696,SCA-12: Tremor with cerebellar and cortical atrophy is associated with a CAG repeat expansion.,OBJECTIVE: To characterize the clinical and neuroradiologic features of a new spinocerebellar ataxia  SCA-12  in the index family. BACKGROUND: The authors recently linked SCA-12 to a novel CAG repeat expansion on chromosome 5q31-33 that is located within the 5' region of PPP2R2B  a gene encoding a brain-specific regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 2A. METHODS: Neurologic features of the proband and nine symptomatic relatives in the first SCA-12 family were compiled and  in some individuals  related to changes found on brain MRI or CT. RESULTS: SCA-12 typically presented in the 4th decade of life with action tremor of the head or arms (present in 10/10 of the affected individuals). Hyperreflexia (8/10) was a common feature  and cerebellar signs (8/10)  including ataxia  dysmetria  and dysarthria  developed gradually but were less prominent and disabling than cerebellar dysfunction in other SCA. Subtle parkinsonian features (9/10) and dementia (2/10) were observed in later stages of SCA-12  and psychiatric symptoms  including depression  anxiety  or delusions  were present in some affected family members (4/10). Two individuals studied had nondisabling neurologic signs neonatally  including nystagmus and lower extremity dystonia. Brain images of affected individuals revealed cerebral and cerebellar atrophy. CONCLUSIONS: SCA-12 is a slowly progressive  autosomal dominant  neurodegenerative disorder that differs from other SCA in that it typically presents with action tremor in patients in their mid 30s and usually includes hyperreflexia and subtle parkinsonian signs. Cerebellar dysfunction  including gait ataxia  is relatively nondisabling  and cognitive or psychiatric disorders may occur.

Hyperreflexia (8/10) was a common feature  and cerebellar signs (8/10)  including ataxia  dysmetria  and dysarthria  developed gradually but were less prominent and disabling than cerebellar dysfunction in other SCA. Subtle parkinsonian features (9/10) and dementia (2/10) were observed in later stages of SCA-12  and psychiatric symptoms  including depression  anxiety  or delusions  were present in some affected family members (4/10). Two individuals studied had nondisabling neurologic signs neonatally  including nystagmus and lower extremity dystonia. Brain images of affected individuals revealed cerebral and cerebellar atrophy. CONCLUSIONS: SCA-12 is a slowly progressive  autosomal dominant  neurodegenerative disorder that differs from other SCA in that it typically presents with action tremor in patients in their mid 30s and usually includes hyperreflexia and subtle parkinsonian signs. Cerebellar dysfunction  including gait ataxia  is relatively nondisabling  and cognitive or psychiatric disorders may occur. Neuroradiologic studies reveal atrophy of the cerebellum and cerebral cortex.,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 528}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 528}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'probability': '0.8', 'index': 528}",1,"{'judgement': 'False', 'index': 528}",0,"{'judgement': '', 'probability': '', 'index': 528}",

Thirty-six age-matched subjects were used as controls. The severity of the cognitive decline was assessed at the time of CSF analysis and after a 12-month follow-up. The groups had comparable age  degree of cognitive impairment and disease duration; these parameters were not related to P-tau levels. P-tau discriminated between demented patients and controls  but no significant difference emerged between AD and the other groups. By contrast  higher P-tau values were found to predict  independently of the clinical diagnosis  a more rapid evolution of cognitive decline. Whether these findings are due to a lack of CSF P-tau specificity or to the low reliability of clinical and radiological criteria remains unclear. P-tau may be useful in the evaluation of disease evolution  by predicting the rate of cognitive decline.,0,Cerebrospinal fluid levels of tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 in patients with Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia.In 31 patients with probable Alzheimer's disease (AD)  19 with probable vascular dementia (VaD) and 20 with Possible AD and Possible VaD  cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tau levels hyperphosphorylated at threonine 181 (Ptau) were measured by ELISA.

26727,Regional cerebral glucose metabolism after pridopidine (ACR16) treatment in patients with Huntington disease.,OBJECTIVES: Huntington disease is a hereditary neurodegenerative disorder resulting in loss of motor  cognitive  and behavioral functions and is characterized by a distinctive pattern of cerebral metabolic abnormalities. Pridopidine (ACR16) belongs to a novel class of central nervous system compounds in development for the treatment of Huntington disease. The objective of the study was to investigate the metabolic changes in patients with Huntington disease before and after pridopidine treatment. METHODS: [(18)F]Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomographic imaging was used to measure the regional cerebral metabolic rate of glucose at baseline and after 14 days of open-label pridopidine treatment in 8 patients with Huntington disease. Clinical assessments were performed using the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale. RESULTS: Statistical parametric mapping analysis showed increased metabolic activity in several brain regions such as the precuneus and the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus after treatment. In addition  after pridopidine treatment  the correlation between the clinical status and the cerebral metabolic activity was strengthened. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that pridopidine induces metabolic changes in brain regions implicated as important for mediating compensatory mechanisms in Huntington disease. In addition  the finding of a strong relationship between clinical severity and metabolic activity after treatment also suggests that pridopidine treatment targets a Huntington disease-related metabolic activity pattern.,0,Regional cerebral glucose metabolism after pridopidine (ACR16) treatment in patients with Huntington disease.OBJECTIVES: Huntington disease is a hereditary neurodegenerative disorder resulting in loss of motor  cognitive  and behavioral functions and is characterized by a distinctive pattern of cerebral metabolic abnormalities.

The interactions of coronavirus transmission with socio-economic factors in India using the multivariate approach were also investigated. METHODS: Actual cumulative infected population data from 15 February to May 15, 2020 was used for determination of parameters of a nested exponential statistical model, which were further employed for the prediction of infection. Correlation and Principal component analysis provided the relationships of coronavirus spread with socio-economic factors of different states of India using the Rstudio software. RESULTS: Cumulative infection and spreadability rate predicted by the model was in good agreement with the actual observed data for all countries (R2 = 0.985121 to 0.999635, and MD = 1.2-7.76%) except Iran (R2 = 0.996316, and MD = 18.38%). Currently, the infection rate in India follows an upward trajectory, while other countries show a downward trend. The model claims that India is likely to witness an increased spreading rate of COVID-19 in June and July. Moreover, the flattening of the cumulative infected population is expected to be obtained in October infecting more than 12 lakhs people. Indian states with higher population were more susceptible to virus infection. CONCLUSIONS: A long-term prediction of cumulative cases, spreadability rate, pandemic peak of COVID-19 was made for India. Prediction provided by the model considering most recent data is useful for making appropriate interventions to deal with the rapidly emerging pandemic. Copyright ÁE© 2020 Diabetes India.

Background: Tubercular meningitis has protean manifestations and there is no gold standard test. Thwaites criteria help in differentiating pyogenic meningitis from tubercular meningitis Design/Methods: The case records of all patients admitted for TBM irrespective of all age and gender for the past three years were obtained from the medical record department using International Classification of Diseases code A170 G01. From each medical case file  the patient's demographics  clinical features  medication and medical history  physical findings  radiographs and reports of biochemical laboratory investigations and other investigation were extracted. Thwaite's diagnostic criteria were used to calculate the diagnostic index score. Data were analyzed using SPSS 20.0 version Results: A total of 95 patients were diagnosed with TBM and 61(64.2%) were males. The mean age was 35.3 ±17.3 years. Thwaite's diagnostic criteria were used to calculate the diagnostic index score for TBM  in which out of 95 patients 91(95.8%) scored <4 indicating TBM and 4 (4.2%) scored >4 indicating bacterial meningitis respectively. Among the study population 63 (66.3%) were diagnosed at earlier stage and in 32 (33.7%) the diagnosis was delayed. Forty (42.1%) patients were in BMRC stage I (early -lasts up to 2 weeks)  27 (28.4%) were in stage II (intermediate -lasts from days to weeks) and 28 (29.5%) were in stage III (advanced).

45442,Copper selectively triggers beta-sheet assembly of an N-terminally truncated amyloid beta-peptide beginning with Glu3.,Metal ions have been suggested to induce aggregation of amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta)  which is a key event in Alzheimer's disease. However  direct evidence that specific metal-peptide interactions are responsible for the amyloid formation has not previously been provided. Here we present the first example of the metal-induced amyloid formation by an Abeta fragment  which exhibits a clear-cut dependence on the amino acid sequence. A heptapeptide  EFRHDSG  corresponding to the amino acid residues 3-9 of Abeta (Abeta(3-9)) undergoes a conformational transition from irregular to beta-sheet and self-associates into insoluble aggregates upon Cu(II) binding. A Raman spectrum analysis of the Cu(II)-Abeta(3-9) complex and aggregation assays of mutated Abeta(3-9) peptides demonstrated that a concerted Cu(II) coordination of the imidazole side chain of His6  the carboxyl groups of Glu3 and Asp7  and the amino group at the N-terminus is essential for the amyloid formation. Although Abeta(1-9) and Abeta(2-9) also contain the metal binding sites  neither of these peptides forms amyloid depositions in the presence of Cu(II). The results of this study may not only provide new insight into the mechanism of amyloid formation  but also be important as a step toward the construction of proteinaceous materials with a specific function under the control of Cu(II).,0,Copper selectively triggers beta-sheet assembly of an N-terminally truncated amyloid beta-peptide beginning with Glu3.Metal ions have been suggested to induce aggregation of amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta)  which is a key event in Alzheimer's disease.

7179,"GM-CSF blockade with mavrilimumab in severe COVID-19 pneumonia and systemic hyperinflammation: a single-centre, prospective cohort study","Background: Mortality in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and systemic hyperinflammation is high. We aimed to examine whether mavrilimumab, an anti-granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor-alpha monoclonal antibody, added to standard management, improves clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and systemic hyperinflammation. Method(s): This single-centre prospective cohort study included patients aged 18 years or older who were admitted to San Raffaele Hospital (Milan, Italy) with severe COVID-19 pneumonia, hypoxia, and systemic hyperinflammation. Patients received a single intravenous dose (6 mg/kg) of mavrilimumab added to standard care given by the hospital at the time. The control group consisted of contemporaneous patients with similar baseline characteristics who received standard care at the same hospital. The main outcome was time to clinical improvement (defined as improvement of two or more points on the seven-point ordinal scale of clinical status). Other outcomes included proportion of patients achieving clinical improvement, survival, mechanical ventilation-free survival, and time to fever resolution. Adverse events were monitored daily. Finding(s): Between March 17 and April 15, 2020, 13 non-mechanically ventilated patients (median age 57 years [IQR 52-58], 12 [92%] men) received mavrilimumab and 26 patients (median age 60 [IQR 53-67], 17 [65%] men) in the control group received standard care. During the 28-day follow-up, no patients in the mavrilimumab group died, and seven (27%) patients in the control group died (p=0.086). At day 28, all patients in the mavrilimumab group and 17 (65%) patients in the control group showed clinical improvement (p=0.030), with earlier improvement in the mavrilimumab than in the control group (mean time to improvement 8 days [IQR 5 to 11] vs 19 days [11 to >28], p=0.0001). By day 28, one (8%) patient in the mavrilimumab group progressed to mechanical ventilation compared with nine (35%) patients in the control group who progressed to mechanical ventilation or died (p=0.14). By day 14, fever resolved in ten (91%) of 11 febrile patients in the mavrilimumab group, compared with 11 (61%) of 18 febrile patients in the control group (p=0.18); fever resolution was faster in mavrilimumab recipients versus controls (median time to resolution 1 day [IQR 1 to 2] vs 7 days [3 to >14], p=0.0093). Mavrilimumab was well tolerated, with no infusion reactions. Three (12%) patients in the control group developed infectious complications. Interpretation(s): Mavrilimumab treatment was associated with improved clinical outcomes compared with standard care in non-mechanically ventilated patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia and systemic hyperinflammation. Treatment was well tolerated. Confirmation of efficacy requires controlled testing.

By day 14, fever resolved in ten (91%) of 11 febrile patients in the mavrilimumab group, compared with 11 (61%) of 18 febrile patients in the control group (p=0.18); fever resolution was faster in mavrilimumab recipients versus controls (median time to resolution 1 day [IQR 1 to 2] vs 7 days [3 to >14], p=0.0093). Mavrilimumab was well tolerated, with no infusion reactions. Three (12%) patients in the control group developed infectious complications. Interpretation(s): Mavrilimumab treatment was associated with improved clinical outcomes compared with standard care in non-mechanically ventilated patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia and systemic hyperinflammation. Treatment was well tolerated. Confirmation of efficacy requires controlled testing.

6792,Familial aggregation of parkinsonism in progressive supranuclear palsy.,BACKGROUND: Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by aggregates of the microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT). A nonsignificant trend for positive family history has been observed in two case-control studies and several pedigrees with familial clustering of parkinsonism have been described. Occasionally  mutations in MAPT are found in patients with a clinical phenotype similar to PSP. In this case-control study  we compared the occurrence of dementia and parkinsonism among first-degree relatives of patients with PSP with an age- and sex-matched control group. METHODS: Family history of dementia and parkinsonism was collected from all first-degree relatives of patients with PSP who fulfilled the international National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke criteria for PSP. Age- and sex-matched controls were selected from the Rotterdam Study. Genetic testing and pathologic examination was performed in a subset of familial PSP cases. RESULTS: Fifty-seven (33%) of the 172 patients with PSP had at least one first-degree relative who had dementia or parkinsonism compared to 131 (25%) of the control subjects (odds ratio [OR] 1.5  95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01-2.13). In patients with PSP  more first-degree relatives with parkinsonism were observed compared to controls  with an OR 3.9 (95% CI 1.99-7.61). Twelve patients with PSP (7%) fulfilled the criteria for an autosomal dominant mode of transmission. The intrafamilial phenotype within these pedigrees varied among PSP  dementia  tremor  and parkinsonism. Genetic studies revealed one patient with a P301L mutation in MAPT. Pathologic examination of five familial cases confirmed the clinical diagnosis of PSP  with predominant four repeat tau pathology in affected brain areas. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates familial aggregation of parkinsonism in progressive supranuclear palsy.,0,Familial aggregation of parkinsonism in progressive supranuclear palsy.BACKGROUND: Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by aggregates of the microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT).

50270,Loss of brain tau defines novel sporadic and familial tauopathies with frontotemporal dementia.,Dementia lacking distinctive histopathology (DLDH) or frontotemporal lobe degeneration (FTLD) is the most common neuropathological diagnosis for sporadic frontotemporal dementias (FTDs). The hallmarks of DLDH are neuron loss and gliosis in the absence of any disease-specific brain lesion. Similar brain pathology is also seen in a familial FTD pedigree known as hereditary dysphasic disinhibition dementia 2 (HDDD2). Abnormality in the function or isoform composition of the microtubule binding protein tau is a prominent feature in the brains of many patients with sporadic and hereditary FTDs. Therefore  we studied the tau protein in different brain regions from DLDH and HDDD2 patients. Our results indicate that a selective loss of all six tau isoforms  but not tau mRNA  occurs in these brains compared to normal control and Alzheimer's disease brains. Loss of tau protein was identified by Western blot analysis of protein extracts from DLDH and HDDD2 brains in regions both with and without neuronal degeneration. Functionally  this loss of tau protein may be equivalent to pathogenic mutations in the tau gene identified in familial FTD with parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17). Thus  DLDH and HDDD2 are novel tauopathies with a unique mechanism of pathogenesis. The presence of tau mRNA in these brains suggests that the level of tau protein may be controlled posttranscriptionally  at the level of either translation or mRNA stability.,0,Loss of brain tau defines novel sporadic and familial tauopathies with frontotemporal dementia.Dementia lacking distinctive histopathology (DLDH) or frontotemporal lobe degeneration (FTLD) is the most common neuropathological diagnosis for sporadic frontotemporal dementias (FTDs).

2633,Postural instability is associated with brain atrophy and cognitive impairment in the elderly: the J-SHIPP study.,BACKGROUND/AIMS: Mobility impairment in older adults has been suggested to be a marker of subclinical structural and functional brain abnormalities. We investigated a possible association between static postural instability and brain abnormalities and cognitive decline. METHODS: The study subjects were 390 community residents without definitive dementia (67 +/- 7 years old) and 21 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Brain atrophy was measured by MRI. RESULTS: The mobility of the posturography-measured center of gravity (COG) was positively associated with the temporal horn area (THA; r = 0.260; p < 0.001). Subjects who could not stand on one leg for >40 s (n = 102) showed a significantly larger THA (22 +/- 18 vs. 14 +/- 11 x 10(-2) cm(2); p < 0.001). Multiple regression analysis identified COG path length (beta = 0.118; p = 0.032) and one-leg standing time (beta = 0.176; p = 0.001) as independent determinants of THA. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects (n = 61) had a significantly enlarged THA compared to that of normal cognitive subjects (22 +/- 16 vs. 16 +/- 13 x 10(-2) cm(2); p = 0.002). AD patients showed a more enlarged THA (78 +/- 55 x 10(-2) cm(2)).

38461,The 28-amino acid form of an APLP1-derived Abeta-like peptide is a surrogate marker for Abeta42 production in the central nervous system.,Surrogate markers for the Alzheimer disease (AD)-associated 42-amino acid form of amyloid-beta (Abeta42) have been sought because they may aid in the diagnosis of AD and for clarification of disease pathogenesis.

These novel peptides  APL1beta25  APL1beta27 and APL1beta28  were not deposited in AD brains. Interestingly  most gamma-secretase modulators (GSMs) and familial AD-associated presenilin1 mutants that up-regulate the relative production of Abeta42 cause a parallel increase in the production of APL1beta28 in cultured cells. Moreover  in CSF from patients with pathological mutations in presenilin1 gene  the relative APL1beta28 levels are higher than in non-AD controls  while the relative Abeta42 levels are unchanged or lower. Most strikingly  the relative APL1beta28 levels are higher in CSF from sporadic AD patients (regardless of whether they are at mild cognitive impairment or AD stage)  than those of non-AD controls. Based on these results  we propose the relative level of APL1beta28 in the CSF as a candidate surrogate marker for the relative level of Abeta42 production in the brain.,0,The 28-amino acid form of an APLP1-derived Abeta-like peptide is a surrogate marker for Abeta42 production in the central nervous system.Surrogate markers for the Alzheimer disease (AD)-associated 42-amino acid form of amyloid-beta (Abeta42) have been sought because they may aid in the diagnosis of AD and for clarification of disease pathogenesis.

58161,The double-edged relationship between COVID-19 stress and smoking: Implications for smoking cessation,"INTRODUCTION: Although recent research shows that smokers respond differently to the COVID-19 pandemic, it offers little explanation of why some have increased their smoking, while others decreased it. In this study, we examined a possible explanation for these different responses: pandemic-related stress. METHODS: We conducted an online survey among a representative sample of Dutch current smokers from 11-18 May 2020 (n=957). During that period, COVID-19 was six weeks past the (initial) peak of cases and deaths in the Netherlands. Included in the survey were measures of how the COVID-19 pandemic had changed their smoking, if at all (no change, increased smoking, decreased smoking), and a measure of stress due to COVID-19. RESULTS: Overall, while 14.1% of smokers reported smoking less due to the COVID-19 pandemic, 18.9% of smokers reported smoking more. A multinomial logistic regression analysis revealed that there was a dose-response effect of stress: smokers who were somewhat stressed were more likely to have either increased (OR=2.37; 95% CI: 1.49-3.78) or reduced (OR=1.80; 95% CI: 1.07-3.05) their smoking. Severely stressed smokers were even more likely to have either increased (OR=3.75; 95% CI: 1.84-7.64) or reduced (OR=3.97; 95% CI: 1.70-9.28) their smoking. Thus, stress was associated with both increased and reduced smoking, independently from perceived difficulty of quitting and level of motivation to quit. CONCLUSIONS: Stress related to the COVID-19 pandemic appears to affect smokers in different ways, some smokers increase their smoking while others decrease it. While boredom and restrictions in movement might have stimulated smoking, the threat of contracting COVID-19 and becoming severely ill might have motivated others to improve their health by quitting smoking. These data highlight the importance of providing greater resources for cessation services and the importance of creating public campaigns to enhance cessation in this dramatic time.

63030,The impact of the covid-19 pandemic on mental health: Early quarantine-related anxiety and its correlates among jordanians L'impact de la crise de la covid-19 sur la sante mentale: L'anxiete liee au debut de la quarantaine et ses correlats chez les jordaniens,"Background: Jordan implemented a nationwide lockdown and recommended self-quarantine in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Such measures are expected to have consequences on mental health. Aim(s): In this study, we aimed to estimate the prevalence of quarantine-related anxiety and its socioeconomic correlates. Method(s): An online questionnaire was utilized to collect information about quarantine-related anxiety and related factors from a non-representative sample of Jordanian population in March 2020. The Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) was used to ascertain the level of stress. Using STATA 16, multivariable ordinal logistic regression was done to estimate beta-coeffi-cient (beta) and corresponding 95% CI of the anxiety level. Result(s): Overall, 5274 participants returned the survey. The prevalence of mild, moderate, and severe anxiety was 21.5%, 10.9%, and 6%, respectively. Female gender (beta= 0.47, 95% CI: 0.34 to 0.59) and more members of the household (beta= 0.04, 95% CI: 0.00 to 0.07) were correlated with a higher degree of anxiety, while older age (beta=-0.27, 95% CI:-0.33 to-0.20), having larger social network (beta=-0.17, 95% CI-0.22 to-0.13), social support (beta=-0.28, 95% CI:-0.32 to-0.23), and higher income (>2000 Jordanian Dinars vs reference, beta=-0.52, 95% CI:-0.71 to-0.33) were correlated with lower BAI scores. Conclusion(s): Our findings showed that approximately four out of every ten participants experienced quarantine-related anxiety. Younger participants, women, and people with poor social support were more likely to experience quarantine-re-lated anxiety.

Such measures are expected to have consequences on mental health. Aim(s): In this study, we aimed to estimate the prevalence of quarantine-related anxiety and its socioeconomic correlates. Method(s): An online questionnaire was utilized to collect information about quarantine-related anxiety and related factors from a non-representative sample of Jordanian population in March 2020. The Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) was used to ascertain the level of stress. Using STATA 16, multivariable ordinal logistic regression was done to estimate beta-coeffi-cient (beta) and corresponding 95% CI of the anxiety level. Result(s): Overall, 5274 participants returned the survey. The prevalence of mild, moderate, and severe anxiety was 21.5%, 10.9%, and 6%, respectively. Female gender (beta= 0.47, 95% CI: 0.34 to 0.59) and more members of the household (beta= 0.04, 95% CI: 0.00 to 0.07) were correlated with a higher degree of anxiety, while older age (beta=-0.27, 95% CI:-0.33 to-0.20), having larger social network (beta=-0.17, 95% CI-0.22 to-0.13), social support (beta=-0.28, 95% CI:-0.32 to-0.23), and higher income (>2000 Jordanian Dinars vs reference, beta=-0.52, 95% CI:-0.71 to-0.33) were correlated with lower BAI scores. Conclusion(s): Our findings showed that approximately four out of every ten participants experienced quarantine-related anxiety.

In current clinical practice  structural imaging (CT or MRI) is used to identify space-occupying lesions and stroke. Functional methods  such as PET scanning of glucose metabolism  could be used to differentiate Alzheimer's disease from frontotemporal dementia  which helps to guide clinicians in symptomatic treatment strategies. New neuroimaging methods that are currently being developed can measure specific neurotransmitter systems  amyloid plaque and tau tangle concentrations  and neuronal integrity and connectivity. Successful co-development of neuroimaging surrogate markers and preventive treatments might eventually lead to so-called brain-check scans for determining risk of cognitive decline  so that physicians can administer disease-modifying medications  vaccines  or other interventions to avoid future cognitive losses and to delay onset of disease.

SETTING: Tertiary referral center/COVID-19 pandemic hospital. STUDY DESIGN: Comparative study. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: After power analysis, 128 subjects were divided into 2 groups according to real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) COVID-19 testing results. Subjects were called via telephone, and the AAO-HNS Anosmia Reporting Tool was used to collect responses. RESULTS: The mean age of the study group was 38.63 +/- 10.08 years. At the time of sampling, rhinorrhea was significantly high in the COVID-19-negative group, whereas those complaints described as ""other"" were significantly high in the COVID-19-positive group. There was a significant difference in the smell/taste impairment rates of the groups (n = 46% [71.9%] for the COVID-19-positive group vs n = 17 [26.6%] for the COVID-19-negative group, P = .001). For subjects with a smell impairment, anosmia rates did not differ between the groups. The rates of hyposmia and parosmia were significantly high in the COVID-19-positive group. For the subjects with taste impairment, ageusia rates did not differ between groups. The rate of hypogeusia and dysgeusia was significantly high in the COVID-19-positive group. Logistic regression analysis indicates that smell/taste impairment in COVID-19-positive subjects increases the odds ratio by 6.956 (95% CI, 3.16-15.29) times.

57927,Disruption of response inhibition circuits in prodromal Huntington disease.,Cognitive changes in the prodromal phase of Huntington disease (prHD) are found in multiple domains  yet their neural bases are not well understood. One component process that supports cognition is inhibitory control. In the present fMRI study  we examined brain circuits involved in response inhibition in 65 prHD participants and 36 gene-negative (NEG) controls using the stop signal task (SST). PrHD participants were subdivided into three groups (LOW  MEDIUM  HIGH) based on their CAG-Age Product (CAP) score  an index of genetic exposure and a proxy for expected time to diagnosis. Poorer response inhibition (stop signal duration) correlated with CAP scores. When response inhibition was successful  activation of the classic frontal inhibitory-network was normal in prHD  yet stepwise reductions in activation with proximity to diagnosis were found in the posterior ventral attention network (inferior parietal and temporal cortices). Failures in response inhibition in prHD were related to changes in inhibition centers (supplementary motor area (SMA)/anterior cingulate and inferior frontal cortex/insula) and ventral attention networks  where activation decreased with proximity to diagnosis. The LOW group showed evidence of early compensatory activation (hyperactivation) of right-hemisphere inhibition and attention reorienting centers  despite an absence of cortical atrophy or deficits on tests of executive functioning. Moreover  greater activation for failed than successful inhibitions in an ipsilateral motor-control network was found in the control group  whereas such differences were markedly attenuated in all prHD groups. The results were not related to changes in cortical volume and thickness  which did not differ among the groups. However  greater hypoactivation of classic right-hemisphere inhibition centers [inferior frontal gyrus (IFG)/insula  SMA/anterior cingulate cortex (ACC)] during inhibition failures correlated with greater globus pallidus atrophy. These results are the first to demonstrate that response inhibition in prHD is associated with altered functioning in brain networks that govern inhibition  attention  and motor control.,0,Disruption of response inhibition circuits in prodromal Huntington disease.Cognitive changes in the prodromal phase of Huntington disease (prHD) are found in multiple domains  yet their neural bases are not well understood.

43054,A Novel Protocol for Very Early Hospital Discharge following STEMI,"Although the incidence of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is on the decline, management of patients presenting with STEMI continues to require significant healthcare resources. Earlier hospital discharge in low-risk patients presenting with STEMI has been an area of focus in an attempt to reduce healthcare costs. As a result, discharge within 48-72 hrs following successful primary PCI has increasingly become routine practice. Moreover, the current COVID-19 pandemic has led to enormous pressure on healthcare systems to find ways to increase bed-capacity, preserve resources, and reduce the risk of exposure to patients and healthcare workers. In response to this goal, the Ottawa Heart Institute has developed and implemented a novel Very Early Hospital Discharge (VEHD) protocol. The VEHD protocol is a simple, four-step algorithm designed to accurately and efficiently identify low-risk STEMI patients that can be safely discharged between 20 and 36 hours after successful primary PCI. Once deemed eligible for VEHD pre-discharge tasks are completed by the treating medical and nursing team and the patient is discharged home. Follow-up is completed remotely via through virtual care (48-hours, 7-days, 30-days), and in the outpatient cardiology clinic (4-6 weeks). Amid a worldwide COVID-19 pandemic we believe the VEHD protocol is a crucial step in maintaining exceptional quality of care, both in terms of patient satisfaction and clinical outcomes, while concurrently lowering the risk of nosocomial infections, and reducing resource utilization.

COVID-19 has rapidly emerged as a pandemic infection that has caused significant mortality and economic losses. Potential therapies and prophylaxis against COVID-19 are urgently needed to combat this novel infection. As a result of in vitro evidence suggesting zinc sulphate may be efficacious against COVID-19, our hospitals began using zinc sulphate as add-on therapy to hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin. Aim. To compare outcomes among hospitalized COVID-19 patients ordered to receive hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin plus zinc sulphate versus hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin alone. Methodology. This was a retrospective observational study. Data was collected from medical records for all patients with admission dates ranging from 2 March 2020 through to 11 April 2020. Initial clinical characteristics on presentation, medications given during the hospitalization, and hospital outcomes were recorded. The study included patients admitted to any of four acute care NYU Langone Health Hospitals in New York City. Patients included were admitted to the hospital with at least one positive COVID-19 test and had completed their hospitalization. Patients were excluded from the study if they were never admitted to the hospital or if there was an order for other investigational therapies for COVID-19. Results. Patients taking zinc sulphate in addition to hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin (n=411) and patients taking hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin alone (n=521) did not differ in age, race, sex, tobacco use or relevant comorbidities. The addition of zinc sulphate did not impact the length of hospitalization, duration of ventilation or intensive care unit (ICU) duration. In univariate analyses, zinc sulphate increased the frequency of patients being discharged home, and decreased the need for ventilation, admission to the ICU and mortality or transfer to hospice for patients who were never admitted to the ICU. After adjusting for the time at which zinc sulphate was added to our protocol, an increased frequency of being discharged home (OR 1.53, 95 % CI 1.12-2.09) and reduction in mortality or transfer to hospice among patients who did not require ICU level of care remained significant (OR 0.449, 95 % CI 0.271-0.744).

16439,Differential impact of whole-brain radiotherapy added to radiosurgery for brain metastases,Purpose: The authors investigated whether the addition of whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) to stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) provided any therapeutic benefit according to recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) class. Methods and Materials: Two hundred forty-five patients with 1 to 10 metastases who underwent SRS between January 2002 and December 2007 were included in the study. Of those  168 patients were treated with SRS alone and 77 patients received SRS followed by WBRT. Actuarial curves were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method regarding overall survival (OS)  distant brain control (DC)  and local brain control (LC) stratified by RPA class. Analyses for known prognostic variables were performed using the Cox proportional hazards model. Results: Univariate and multivariate analysis revealed that control of the primary tumor  small number of brain metastases  Karnofsky performance scale (KPS) > 70  and initial treatment modalities were significant predictors for survival. For RPA class 1  SRS plus WBRT was associated with a longer survival time compared with SRS alone (854 days vs. 426 days  p = 0.042). The SRS plus WBRT group also showed better LC rate than did the SRS-alone group (p = 0.021)  although they did not show a better DC rate (p = 0.079). By contrast  for RPA class 2 or 3  no significant difference in OS  LC  or DC was found between the two groups. Conclusions: These results suggest that RPA classification should determine whether or not WBRT is added to SRS. WBRT may be recommended to be added to SRS for patients in whom long-term survival is expected on the basis of RPA classification. Copyright © 2010 Elsevier Inc. Printed in the USA.

To qualify more patients for this treatment  we evaluated the effect of predosing with non-radiolabeled MIBG on 131I-MIBG tumour targeting in carcinoid patients and in mice with BON human carcinoid xenografts. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ten carcinoid patients with a faint tumour imaging on a diagnostic 131I-MIBG scan (1 mCi = 37 MBq  5 mg MIBG) received non-radiolabeled MIBG prior to a second scintigraphy. In case of improved tumour targeting patients were treated with 200 mCi (7.4 GBq) 131I-MIBG following a pharmacological predose of 20-40 mg/m2 MIBG. RESULTS: In six patients. highly increased 'tumour/non-tumour' ratios were seen due to reduced levels in normal tissues and increased tumour accumulation. The combined treatment applied in five patients  considerably improved symptoms in all (duration 6-12 months)  accompanied by biochemical response in three. In BON carcinoid xenografted mice  MIBG was injected intraperitoneally followed by intravenous 125I-MIBG with similar findings: increased 'tumour/non-tumour' radioactivity ratios by 1.5-3-fold.

52102,Recording diaphragm activity by feeding tube: A new tool to evaluate diaphragmatic paralysis's recovery.,"Introduction: Insults to the respiratory central nervous system or peripheral nerves can result in respiratory failure leading to prolonged ventilator dependency. Tests currently used to monitor diaphragm recovery are neither accurate to quantify diaphragmatic paralysis recovery nor routinely performed at bedside. In this context  we lack predictors of respiratory recovery [1]. We report one infant with bilateral diaphragmatic paralysis secondary to botulism in whom assessment of electrical activity of the diaphragm (EAdi) with a specific feeding tube successfully monitored functional recovery. Description: One month old infant with botulism was admitted to a pediatric intensive care unit for mechanical ventilation. A commercialized feeding tube equipped with sensors for EAdi's recording (Edi catheter 8 Fr  Maquet Critical Care  Solna  Sweden) was connected to a Servo-I Ventilator (Maquet Critical Care  Solna  Sweden) and a spontaneous breathing trial was performed. The spontaneous breathing trial consisted of a 30 minutes period in pressure support mode with a positive inspiratory pressure of 10 cmH2O and positive end expiratory pressure of 5 cmH2O. We regularly monitored diaphragm electrical activity during spontaneous breathing trials. The EAdi was initially very low (1.0 muV) and increased progressively (figure 1). The infant was extubated successfully when EAdi was 5.9 muV. Discussion: Tests currently used to assess diaphragmatic weakness have significant limitations. Chest radiographs  fluoroscopic imaging  diaphragm's ultrasound and static inspiratory pressure measurements are insensitive tests. The ""gold standard"" techniques are invasive and uncomfortable including maximal static transdiaphragmatic pressure and phrenic nerve stimulation[2] [3]. Recently  transcranial magnetic stimulation coupled to electromyography has been proposed in predicting the recovery of ventilatory activity [1]. The monitoring of EAdi is a user friendly bedside tool to measure diaphragm recovery  which may help to determine the appropriate timing for extubation. This monitoring can easily be done during daily spontaneous breathing trials that are part of usual practice [3]. These cases suggest that this tool will be helpful for the bedside management of children and adults with bilateral diaphragmatic paralysis. .",0,"Recording diaphragm activity by feeding tube: A new tool to evaluate diaphragmatic paralysis's recovery.Introduction: Insults to the respiratory central nervous system or peripheral nerves can result in respiratory failure leading to prolonged ventilator dependency.

Here, we report the clinical course of coronavirus infection 2019 infection of a patient in whom older aged, having multiple co-morbidities, and taking nivolumab for metastatic malignant melanoma. In contrast to her older age, comorbidities, and cancer diagnosis, she was in a good condition, and there was also no pneumonia finding. We think that this good clinical course of coronavirus infection 2019 infection may be related to blockade of PD-1/PDL-1 pathway with nivolumab. It is impossible to say that blockade of PD-1/PDL-1pathway is a treatment option for COVID-19; however, we want to share our experience.","{'judgement': 'False', 'index': 579}",0,"{'judgement': 'False', 'index': 579}",0,"{'judgement': 'False', 'index': 579}",0,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 579}",1,"{'judgement': 'False', 'index': 579}",0
60603,Do RCAN1 proteins link chronic stress with neurodegeneration?,It has long been suspected that chronic stress can exacerbate  or even cause  disease. We now propose that the RCAN1 gene  which can generate several RCAN1 protein isoforms  may be at least partially responsible for this phenomenon. We review data showing that RCAN1 proteins can be induced by multiple stresses  and present new data also implicating psychosocial/emotional stress in RCAN1 induction. We further show that transgenic mice overexpressing the RCAN1-1L protein exhibit accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau protein (AT8 antibody)  an early precursor to the formation of neurofibrillary tangles and neurodegeneration of the kind seen in Alzheimer disease. We propose that  although transient induction of the RCAN1 gene might protect cells against acute stress  persistent stress may cause chronic RCAN1 overexpression  resulting in serious side effects. Chronically elevated levels of RCAN1 proteins may promote or exacerbate various diseases  including tauopathies such as Alzheimer disease. We propose that the mechanism by which stress can lead to these diseases involves the inhibition of calcineurin and the induction of GSK-3EEE by RCAN1 proteins. Both inhibition of calcineurin and induction of GSK-3EEE contribute to accumulation of phosphorylated tau  formation of neurofibrillary tangles  and eventual neurodegeneration.,0,Do RCAN1 proteins link chronic stress with neurodegeneration?It has long been suspected that chronic stress can exacerbate  or even cause  disease.

Case presentation: On 24 April 2020, three staff members of a tertiary diagnostic laboratory in Groote Schuur Hospital, Cape Town, South Africa, tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Within seven days, a further nine cases were identified, which suggested an outbreak and prompted a full investigation. Management and outcome: A multifaceted strategic approach was adopted to halt the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in our laboratory. Interventions focused on simultaneously establishing appropriate risk mitigation and stratification strategies through the upscaling of infection prevention and control measures, whilst minimising disruption to service delivery. Conclusion: Laboratory Coronavirus Disease 2019 outbreaks have the potential to cripple a laboratory's testing capacity.

Here we tested the hypothesis of a progressive impairment of cortical alpha reactivity to eye-opening across amnesic MCI and mild AD subjects  reflecting another aspect of the impairment of cortical neural synchronization. Resting electroencephalography (EEG) data were recorded in 36 normal elderly subjects (Nold)  91 amnesic MCI  and 31 mild AD subjects during eyes-closed and -open conditions. EEG sources were estimated by LORETA software. In the eye-closed condition  posterior alpha 1 (8-10.5 Hz) sources were lower in MCI and AD than Nold subjects. The opposite was true for occipital delta sources (2-4 Hz). Reactivity to the eyes-open condition showed posterior alpha 1 and alpha 2 (10.5-13 Hz) sources was high in the Nold  intermediate in the MCI  and low in the AD subjects. Furthermore  occipital alpha 1 reactivity across MCI and AD subjects was correlated to the cognitive impairment as revealed by Mini-Mental State Examination score.

44726,Unusual zwitterionic catalytic site of SARS-CoV-2 main protease revealed by neutron crystallography,"The main protease (3CL Mpro) from SARS-CoV-2, the etiological agent of COVID-19, is an essential enzyme for viral replication. 3CL Mpro possesses an unusual catalytic dyad composed of Cys145 and His41 residues. A critical question in the field has been what the protonation states of the ionizable residues in the substrate-binding active site cavity are; resolving this point would help understand the catalytic details of the enzyme and inform rational drug development against this pernicious virus. Here, we present the room-temperature neutron structure of 3CL Mpro, which allowed direct determination of hydrogen atom positions and, hence, protonation states in the protease. We observe that the catalytic site natively adopts a zwitterionic reactive form where Cys145 is in the negatively charged thiolate state, and His41 is doubly protonated and positively charged, instead of the neutral unreactive state usually envisaged. The neutron structure also identified the protonation states, and thus electrical charges, of all other amino acid residues and revealed intricate hydrogen bonding networks in the active site cavity and at the dimer interface. The fine atomic details present in this structure were made possible by the unique scattering properties of the neutron, which is an ideal probe for locating hydrogen positions and experimentally determining protonation states at near-physiological temperature. Our observations provide critical information for structure-assisted and computational drug design, allowing precise tailoring of inhibitors to the enzyme's electrostatic environment.

3762,An apolipoprotein E-based therapeutic improves outcome and reduces Alzheimer's disease pathology following closed head injury: evidence of pharmacogenomic interaction.,Apolipoprotein E (apoE) modifies glial activation and the CNS inflammatory response in an isoform-specific manner. Peptides derived from the receptor-binding region of apoE have been demonstrated to maintain the functional activity of the intact protein  and to improve histological and functional deficits after closed head injury. In the current study  APOE2  APOE3  and APOE4 targeted replacement (TR) mice expressing the human apoE protein isoforms (apoE2  apoE3 and apoE4) were used in a clinically relevant model of closed head injury to assess the interaction between the humanized apoE background and the therapeutic apoE mimetic peptide  apoE(133-149). Treatment with the apoE-mimetic peptide reduced microglial activation and early inflammatory events in all of the targeted replacement animals and was associated with histological and functional improvement in the APOE2TR and APOE3TR animals. Similarly  brain beta amyloid protein (Abeta)(1-42) levels were increased as a function of head injury in all of the targeted replacement mice  while treatment with apoE peptide suppressed Abeta(1-42) levels in the APOE2TR and APOE3TR animals. These results suggest a pharmacogenomic interaction between the therapeutic effects of the apoE mimetic peptide and the human apoE protein isoforms. Furthermore  they suggest that administration of apoE-mimetic peptides may serve as a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of acute and chronic neurological disease.,0,An apolipoprotein E-based therapeutic improves outcome and reduces Alzheimer's disease pathology following closed head injury: evidence of pharmacogenomic interaction.Apolipoprotein E (apoE) modifies glial activation and the CNS inflammatory response in an isoform-specific manner.

We have determined the solution structure of the two domain protein hPin1-(1-163) and its separately expressed PPIase domain (50-163) (hPin1PPIase) with an root mean square deviation of <0.5 A over backbone atoms using NMR. Domain organization of hPin1 differs from that observed in structures solved by x-ray crystallography. Whereas PPIase and WW domain are tightly packed onto each other and share a common binding interface in crystals  our NMR-based data revealed only weak interaction of both domains at their interface in solution. Interaction between the two domains of full-length hPin1 is absent when the protein is dissected into the catalytic and the WW domain. It indicates that the flexible linker  connecting both domains  promotes binding. By evaluation of NOESY spectra we can show that the alpha1/beta1 loop  which was proposed to undergo a large conformational rearrangement in the absence of sulfate and an Ala-Pro peptide  remained in the closed conformation under these conditions. Dissociation constants of 0.4 and 2.0 mm for sulfate and phosphate ions were measured at 12 degrees C by fluorescence spectroscopy. Binding of sulfate prevents hPin1 aggregation and changes surface charges across the active center and around the reactive and catalytically essential Cys113.

34958,Novel 5' untranslated region directed blockers of iron-regulatory protein-1 dependent amyloid precursor protein translation: implications for down syndrome and Alzheimer's disease.,We reported that iron influx drives the translational expression of the neuronal amyloid precursor protein (APP)  which has a role in iron efflux. This is via a classic release of repressor interaction of APP mRNA with iron-regulatory protein-1 (IRP1) whereas IRP2 controls the mRNAs encoding the L- and H-subunits of the iron storage protein  ferritin. Here  we identified thirteen potent APP translation blockers that acted selectively towards the uniquely configured iron-responsive element (IRE) RNA stem loop in the 5' untranslated region (UTR) of APP mRNA. These agents were 10-fold less inhibitory of 5'UTR sequences of the related prion protein (PrP) mRNA. Western blotting confirmed that the 'ninth' small molecule in the series selectively reduced neural APP production in SH-SY5Y cells at picomolar concentrations without affecting viability or the expression of ~}q-synuclein and ferritin. APP blocker-9 (JTR-009)  a benzimidazole  reduced the production of toxic A~}r in SH-SY5Y neuronal cells to a greater extent than other well tolerated APP 5'UTR-directed translation blockers  including posiphen  that were shown to limit amyloid burden in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease (AD). RNA binding assays demonstrated that JTR-009 operated by preventing IRP1 from binding to the IRE in APP mRNA  while maintaining IRP1 interaction with the H-ferritin IRE RNA stem loop. Thus  JTR-009 constitutively repressed translation driven by APP 5'UTR sequences. Calcein staining showed that JTR-009 did not indirectly change iron uptake in neuronal cells suggesting a direct interaction with the APP 5'UTR. These studies provide key data to develop small molecules that selectively reduce neural APP and A~}r production at 10-fold lower concentrations than related previously characterized translation blockers.

6269,Neuroanatomical correlates of awareness of illness in patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment who will or will not convert to Alzheimer's disease.,BACKGROUND: Awareness of cognitive deficits may be reduced in mild cognitive impairment (MCI). This may have a detrimental effect on illness course and may be a predictor of subsequent conversion to AD. Although neuropsychological correlates have been widely investigated  no evidence of a neuroanatomical basis of the phenomenon has been reported yet. This study was aimed at investigating the neuroanatomical correlates of deficit awareness in amnestic MCI to determine whether they constitute risk factors for conversion to AD. METHOD: A sample of 36 first-diagnosis amnestic MCI patients were followed for five years. At the first diagnostic visit they were administered an extensive diagnostic and clinical procedure and the Memory Insight Questionnaire (MIQ)  measuring a total index and four sub-indices  to investigate awareness of deficits in dementia; they also underwent a high resolution T1-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) investigation. Grey matter brain volumes were analysed on a voxel-by-voxel basis using Statistical Parametric Mapping 8. Data of 10 converter patients (CONV) and those of 26 non converter patients (NOCONV) were analysed using multiple regression models. RESULTS: At baseline  self-awareness of memory deficits was poorer in CONV compared to NOCONV. Furthermore  reduced awareness of cognitive deficits in CONV correlated with reduced grey matter volume of the anterior cingulate (memory deficit awareness)  right pars triangularis of the inferior frontal cortex (memory deficit awareness) and cerebellar vermis (total awareness)  whereas in NOCONV it correlated with reduced grey matter volume of left superior (total awareness) and middle (language deficit awareness) temporal areas. Further  at baseline self-awareness of memory deficits were poorer in CONV than in NOCONV. CONCLUSIONS: Defective awareness of cognitive deficits is underpinned by different mechanisms in CONV and NOCONV amnestic MCI patients. Our data support the hypothesis that poor awareness of cognitive deficit is a predictor of subsequent conversion to AD.,0,Neuroanatomical correlates of awareness of illness in patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment who will or will not convert to Alzheimer's disease.BACKGROUND: Awareness of cognitive deficits may be reduced in mild cognitive impairment (MCI).

Further  at baseline self-awareness of memory deficits were poorer in CONV than in NOCONV. CONCLUSIONS: Defective awareness of cognitive deficits is underpinned by different mechanisms in CONV and NOCONV amnestic MCI patients. Our data support the hypothesis that poor awareness of cognitive deficit is a predictor of subsequent conversion to AD.,"{'judgement': 'False', 'index': 592}",0,"{'judgement': 'False', 'index': 592}",0,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 592}",1,"{'judgement': 'False', 'index': 592}",0,"{'judgement': 'False', 'index': 592}",0
35022,Development of epitope-based peptide vaccine against novel Coronavirus 2019 (SARS-COV-2): Immunoinformatics approach,"Recently, a novel Coronavirus (SARS-COV-2) emerged which is responsible for the recent outbreak in Wuhan, China. Genetically, it is closely related to the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. The situation is getting worse and worse, therefore, there is an urgent need for designing a suitable peptide vaccine component against the SARS-COV-2. Here, we characterized spike glycoprotein to obtain immunogenic epitopes. Next, we chose 13 Major Histocompatibility Complex-(MHC) I and 3 MHC-II epitopes, having antigenic properties. These epitopes are usually linked to specific linkers to build vaccine components and molecularly dock on Toll-Like Receptor (TLR)-5 to get binding affinity. Therefore, in order to provide a fast immunogenic profile of these epitopes we performed immunoinformatics analysis so that rapid development of vaccine might bring this disastrous situation to the end earlier.

Endosomal abnormalities invariably occur within neurons in AD brains  and endocytic compartments are one likely site for the production of the pathogenic beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta)  which accumulates within the brain during the disease and is generated by proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). The enzymes and events involved in APP processing are appealing targets for therapeutic agents aimed at slowing or reversing the pathogenesis of AD. The neuronal endosome may well prove to be the intracellular site of action for inhibitors of beta-amyloidogenic APP processing.

On admission a skin rash consisting of blister and pustules was noted on the palms of both hands. He had pain on pressure over the right upper abdomen  an enlarged prostate and definite pain on percussing the vertebral column with restricted movement of the thoracic vertebral column  but no other physical signs. INVESTIGATIONS: Radiology revealed clearly increased sclerosis of several thoracic vertebrae with osteolytic destruction and a paravertebral soft tissue tumor. Search for a primary tumor was unsuccessful. Bone scintigraphy demonstrated nuclide enrichment of the thoracic vertebrae and of the sternoclavicular joints without increase in the LeukoScan. These findings indicated the diagnosis of SAPHO syndrome (synovitis-acne-pustulosis-hyperostosis-osteomyelitis). TREATMENT AND COURSE: Rapid subjective and objective improvement followed the administration of clindamycin and ibuprofen. CONCLUSION: In case of bone pain of uncertain aetiology  especially when associated with skin rash  the rare SAPHO syndrome should be considered in the differential diagnosis  avoiding lengthy diagnostic steps and allowing early treatment.,0,Vertebral destruction with sever pain in the SAPHO syndromeHISTORY AND ADMISSION FINDINGS: A 57-year-old man had for the past 18 months complained of recurrent  recently worsening  belt-like backache radiating ventrally.

17092,Identification of resting and active state EEG features of Alzheimer's disease using discrete wavelet transform.,Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with deficits in a number of cognitive processes and executive functions. Moreover  abnormalities in the electroencephalogram (EEG) power spectrum develop with the progression of AD. These features have been traditionally characterized with montage recordings and conventional spectral analysis during resting eyes-closed and resting eyes-open (EO) conditions. In this study  we introduce a single lead dry electrode EEG device which was employed on AD and control subjects during resting and activated battery of cognitive and sensory tasks such as Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT) and auditory stimulations. EEG signals were recorded over the left prefrontal cortex (Fp1) from each subject. EEG signals were decomposed into sub-bands approximately corresponding to the major brain frequency bands using several different discrete wavelet transforms and developed statistical features for each band. Decision tree algorithms along with univariate and multivariate statistical analysis were used to identify the most predictive features across resting and active states  separately and collectively. During resting state recordings  we found that the AD patients exhibited elevated D4 (~4-8 Hz) mean power in EO state as their most distinctive feature. During the active states  however  the majority of AD patients exhibited larger minimum D3 (~8-12 Hz) values during auditory stimulation (18 Hz) combined with increased kurtosis of D5 (~2-4 Hz) during PASAT with 2 s interval. When analyzed using EEG recording data across all tasks  the most predictive AD patient features were a combination of the first two feature sets. However  the dominant discriminating feature for the majority of AD patients were still the same features as the active state analysis. The results from this small sample size pilot study indicate that although EEG recordings during resting conditions are able to differentiate AD from control subjects  EEG activity recorded during active engagement in cognitive and auditory tasks provide important distinct features  some of which may be among the most predictive discriminating features.,0,Identification of resting and active state EEG features of Alzheimer's disease using discrete wavelet transform.Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with deficits in a number of cognitive processes and executive functions.

In addition to routine psychological tests, the participants were asked the following two questions: ""Do you know COVID-19?"" and ""Why are you wearing a face mask?"". Moderate to severe AD patients were found to have a low COVID-19 recognition rate and did not fully understand why they were wearing face masks. In addition, because they did not understand the seriousness of the COVID-19 outbreak, their Geriatric Depression Scale scores were also substantially lower. These results may appear to simply indicate that people with severe dementia are unaware of current events.

21574,Prognostic and Therapeutic Indicator of Fluoroboronophenylalanine Positron Emission Tomography in Patients with Gliomas,Purpose: Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) for the treatment of brain tumors has attracted attention recently  and its clinical application has been progressing. We have focused on the use of BNCT with 10B-boronophenylalanine  which preferentially delivers boron-10 atoms to malignant cells through the amino acid transport system. In the present study  we evaluated the long-term outcomes of treatments using 18F-10B-fluoroboronophenylalanine (FBPA)  which is an analogue of 10B-boronophenylalanine  by investigating the prognostic significance of the metabolic values and ratios of FBPA as determined by positron emission tomography (PET) in patients with gliomas. Experimental Design: Our subjects were 22 patients who underwent an FBPA-PET study and were followed for at least 4 months thereafter. PET parameters  such as the rate constants K1  k2  k3  and k4  were measured before treatment. Data regarding the tumors  the contralateral normal region  and the uptake ratio of FBPA between the tumor and normal tissue 40 min after injection of the tracer were compared with survival rates after the PET treatment. The survival time and the prognostic factors were tested using a Kaplan-Meier survival curve and Cox regression analysis  respectively. Results: Among the clinical parameters  the histological grade of a tumor influences survival significantly. When the survival of patients with PET parameters or ratios above the median was compared with that of patients with parameters or ratios below the median  the most significant PET parameter was the K1 value of the tumor. Median survival in patients with a tumor K1 value of 0.033 ml/min (median value) or higher was 11 months  which was significantly shorter than the 77 months in patients with a K1 value below the median (P = 0.0006 by generalized Wilcoxon test). Conclusions: The kinetic constants of FBPA metabolism as determined by PET can be of ancillary significance in predicting the prognosis and indicating the feasibility of BNCT in patients with gliomas. The mean survival time was significantly shorter in patients with high uptakes of FBPA. A contributing factor is the K1 value  which reflects amino acid transport activity.

46555,Interaction of cardiovascular disease and neurodegeneration: transcranial Doppler ultrasonography and Alzheimer's disease.,OBJECTIVE: Recent post-mortem studies have reported that the severity of atheromatous deposits in the circle of Willis is significantly greater  relative to non-demented (ND) elderly persons  in subjects with neuropathologically diagnosed Alzheimer's disease (AD). Additionally  the severity of intracranial atherosclerosis correlates significantly with the densities of neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. In this study  we examine the arteries of the circle of Willis by transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasonography. METHODS: TCD was used to measure  in 25 AD patients and 30 ND elderly subjects  mean flow velocities and pulsatility indices in 16 different segments of the circle of Willis. The data were compared with and without adjustment for age  gender and systolic blood pressure. RESULTS: The AD patients had systematically higher pulsatility indices (p<0.005) than the ND group. Incremental increases of pulsatility indices in these segments had odds ratios ranging from 1.8 to 48 for the presence of AD when adjusted for age  gender and systolic blood pressure. The left internal carotid artery siphon and the left posterior cerebral artery were the two vessels that were strongly associated with AD diagnosis. Mean flow velocities were generally lower in patients with AD but the differences did not reach the significance level. DISCUSSION: The pulsatility indices of the arteries of AD patients were generally greater than those of similarly-aged ND subjects. This difference is most likely due to increased arterial wall rigidity imposed by atherosclerotic changes. Atherosclerotic disease of intracranial arteries may be a risk factor for AD.,0,Interaction of cardiovascular disease and neurodegeneration: transcranial Doppler ultrasonography and Alzheimer's disease.OBJECTIVE: Recent post-mortem studies have reported that the severity of atheromatous deposits in the circle of Willis is significantly greater  relative to non-demented (ND) elderly persons  in subjects with neuropathologically diagnosed Alzheimer's disease (AD).

RESULTS: The imposition of lockdown-measures coincided with a significant drop in incidents (total, P < .001; aggression, P = .008; unexplained absences, P = .008; and medication errors, P < .001). Incidents in total (P = .001) and with aggression (P < .001) then climbed from this initial low level, while medication errors remained stably low (P = .94). CONCLUSION: The rise in incidents involving aggression, against the background of generally lowered reporting, underlines the need for pandemic control measures that are suitable for people with intellectual disability in long-term care.

53412,Intravascular lymphomatosis mimicking primary central nervous system lymphoma: a case report and literature review,We herein report a 75-year-old female patient with intravascular lymphomatosis (IVL) who presented with fever of unknown origin. Examination  including contrast-enhanced CT and (67)Ga scintigraphy  failed to show any lesions. Her blood levels of lactate dehydrogenase and soluble interleukin-2 receptors were high  suggesting a lymphomatous tumor. A bone marrow puncture was negative  and a random skin biopsy revealed a monoclonal proliferation of naked  large lymphocytes in the vascular space of the subcutaneous tissue  confirming the diagnosis of IVL. MRI  performed 7 weeks after admission  showed a brain mass mimicking primary central nervous system lymphoma. The mass was considered to be a collection of malignant lymphocyte cells invading from the vessels. Without the random skin biopsy  this case may have been misdiagnosed as primary central nervous system lymphoma.,0,Intravascular lymphomatosis mimicking primary central nervous system lymphoma: a case report and literature reviewWe herein report a 75-year-old female patient with intravascular lymphomatosis (IVL) who presented with fever of unknown origin.

22143,Curcumin-conjugated magnetic nanoparticles for detecting amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's disease mice using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).,Diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) can be performed with the assistance of amyloid imaging. The current method relies on positron emission tomography (PET)  which is expensive and exposes people to radiation  undesirable features for a population screening method. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is cheaper and is not radioactive. Our approach uses magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) made of superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) conjugated with curcumin  a natural compound that specifically binds to amyloid plaques. Coating of curcumin-conjugated MNPs with polyethylene glycol-polylactic acid block copolymer and polyvinylpyrrolidone by antisolvent precipitation in a multi-inlet vortex mixer produces stable and biocompatible curcumin magnetic nanoparticles (Cur-MNPs) with mean diameter <100 nm. These nanoparticles were visualized by transmission electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy  and their structure and chemistry were further characterized by X-ray diffraction  thermogravimetric analysis  X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy  time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry  and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Cur-MNPs exhibited no cytotoxicity in either Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) or differentiated human neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y). The Papp of Cur-MNPs was 1.03 EE 10(-6) cm/s in an in vitro blood-brain barrier (BBB) model. Amyloid plaques could be visualized in ex vivo T2*-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of Tg2576 mouse brains after injection of Cur-MNPs  and no plaques could be found in non-transgenic mice. Immunohistochemical examination of the mouse brains revealed that Cur-MNPs were co-localized with amyloid plaques. Thus  Cur-MNPs have the potential for non-invasive diagnosis of AD using MRI.,0,Curcumin-conjugated magnetic nanoparticles for detecting amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's disease mice using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).Diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) can be performed with the assistance of amyloid imaging.

55029,Pathologic evaluation of the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei in dementia.,BACKGROUND: The neuropeptide oxytocin  produced in the supraoptic (SON) and paraventricular nuclei (PVN) of the hypothalamus  is now understood to function as a neurotransmitter critical for various aspects of social cognition and pro-social behaviour. While patients with Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) display prominent and progressive deficits in such social behaviours  the integrity of these nuclei in FTD is not known. METHODS: We conducted a quantitative neuropathologic examination of the SON and PVN from patients with FTLD with TDP-43 proteinopathy  Alzheimer's disease  Lewy body disease and controls to determine whether significant pathologic changes or neuronal loss may contribute to the striking behavioural symptoms of FTD. RESULTS: Contrary to predictions  we found both nuclei to be free of significant pathologic change (TDP-43) in FTLD. In contrast  tau related pathology was found in the PVN in Alzheimer's disease  and alpha-synuclein pathology in the SON in patients with Lewy body dementia. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that the SON and PVN are resistant to FTLD TDP-43 pathology. They also support prior suggestions that the SON is resistant to Alzheimer's disease (AD) related pathology  and extend this to demonstrate SON susceptibility to alpha-synuclein pathology in patients with Lewy body dementia.,0,Pathologic evaluation of the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei in dementia.BACKGROUND: The neuropeptide oxytocin  produced in the supraoptic (SON) and paraventricular nuclei (PVN) of the hypothalamus  is now understood to function as a neurotransmitter critical for various aspects of social cognition and pro-social behaviour.

The dog had been previously treated with several antibiotics, with temporary remission of clinical signs, relapsing each time the therapy was discontinued. On the basis of clinical signs, history and on the investigations performed which failed to detect any other cause of disease, a diagnosis of antibiotic-responsive diarrhoea (ARD) or small intestine bacterial overgrowth secondary to inflammatory bowel disease was made. A threeweek antibiotic treatment with rifaximin by oral route was prescribed, achieving a prompt clinical remission but diarrhoea relapsed shortly after the end of drug administration.

30376,Oxido-reductive state: the major determinant for cellular retention of technetium-99m-HMPAO,Several clinical observations have suggested that HMPAO cerebral uptake might be related not only to regional cerebral perfusion but also to the nature of the lesion. Our aim was to investigate at the cellular level the nature of the process(es) involved in HMPAO accumulation in vitro. METHODS: Time-course incorporation of HM-PAO was studied in a fast-growing human premonocytic line  U937  in a human astrocytic-derived cell line  U373 and a human hybridized endothelial cell line  EaHy926. Minimal differences of HMPAO retention between these cell lines were observed and plateau of %U(HMPAO) (cpm cells/cpm standard of injected) were achieved within 2 hr. Because HMPAO cell retention was related to the intracellular content in glutathione  experiments studying effects of redox were conducted by preexposing U937 cells to D  L dithiothreitol or 2-Mercaptoethanol. RESULTS: Overnight incubation with NAC or BSO did not significantly modified the kinetic of 99mTc-HMPAO incorporation while overnight incubation with NAC resulted in a 2-fold increase in intracellular glutathione content and overnight incubation with BSO nearly abolished the intracellular glutathione content. At the opposite  presence of these reducing agents in the medium during the experiments completely abolished 99mTc-HMPAO retention. CONCLUSION: Our data thus provide in vitro evidence to support that overall intracellular retention of HMPAO is more dependent upon the redox activity of the tissue than the intracellular glutathione content. SPECT-HMPAO may accurately reflect regional cerebral blood flow in a normal state but possibly not in all pathological situations in which cell metabolism disturbances are characterized by alterations in the redox status,0,Oxido-reductive state: the major determinant for cellular retention of technetium-99m-HMPAOSeveral clinical observations have suggested that HMPAO cerebral uptake might be related not only to regional cerebral perfusion but also to the nature of the lesion.

45624,Hippocampal shape analysis using medial surfaces.,In magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) research  significant attention has been paid to the analysis of the hippocampus (HC) within the medial temporal lobe because of its importance in memory and learning  and its role in neurodegenerative diseases. Manual segmentation protocols have established a volume decline in the HC in conjunction with Alzheimer's disease  epilepsy  post-traumatic stress disorder  and depression. Furthermore  recent studies have investigated age-related changes of HC volume which show an interaction with gender; in early adulthood  volume reduction of the HC is found in men but not in women. In this paper  we investigated gender differences in normal subjects in young adulthood by employing a shape analysis of the HC using medial surfaces. For each subject  the most prominent medial manifold of the HC was extracted and flattened. The flattened sheets were then registered using both a rigid and a non-rigid alignment technique  and the medial surface radius was expressed as a height function over them. This allowed for an investigation of the association between subject variables and the local width of the HC. With regard to the effects of age and gender  it could be shown that the previously observed gender differences were mostly due to volume loss in males in the lateral areas of the HC head and tail. We suggest that the analysis of HC shape using medial surfaces might thus serve as a complimentary technique to investigate group differences to the established segmentation protocols for volume quantification in MRI.,0,Hippocampal shape analysis using medial surfaces.In magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) research  significant attention has been paid to the analysis of the hippocampus (HC) within the medial temporal lobe because of its importance in memory and learning  and its role in neurodegenerative diseases.

28962,Amyloid vs FDG-PET in the differential diagnosis of AD and FTLD.,OBJECTIVE: To compare the diagnostic performance of PET with the amyloid ligand Pittsburgh compound B (PiB-PET) to fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG-PET) in discriminating between Alzheimer disease (AD) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). METHODS: Patients meeting clinical criteria for AD (n = 62) and FTLD (n = 45) underwent PiB and FDG-PET. PiB scans were classified as positive or negative by 2 visual raters blinded to clinical diagnosis  and using a quantitative threshold derived from controls (n = 25). FDG scans were visually rated as consistent with AD or FTLD  and quantitatively classified based on the region of lowest metabolism relative to controls. RESULTS: PiB visual reads had a higher sensitivity for AD (89.5% average between raters) than FDG visual reads (77.5%) with similar specificity (PiB 83%  FDG 84%). When scans were classified quantitatively  PiB had higher sensitivity (89% vs 73%) while FDG had higher specificity (83% vs 98%). On receiver operating characteristic analysis  areas under the curve for PiB (0.888) and FDG (0.910) were similar. Interrater agreement was higher for PiB (EEE = 0.96) than FDG (EEE = 0.72)  as was agreement between visual and quantitative classification (PiB EEE = 0.88-0.92; FDG EEE = 0.64-0.68). In patients with known histopathology  overall classification accuracy (2 visual and 1 quantitative classification per patient) was 97% for PiB (n = 12 patients) and 87% for FDG (n = 10). CONCLUSIONS: PiB and FDG showed similar accuracy in discriminating AD and FTLD. PiB was more sensitive when interpreted qualitatively or quantitatively. FDG was more specific  but only when scans were classified quantitatively. PiB slightly outperformed FDG in patients with known histopathology.,0,Amyloid vs FDG-PET in the differential diagnosis of AD and FTLD.OBJECTIVE: To compare the diagnostic performance of PET with the amyloid ligand Pittsburgh compound B (PiB-PET) to fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG-PET) in discriminating between Alzheimer disease (AD) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD).

Interrater agreement was higher for PiB (EEE = 0.96) than FDG (EEE = 0.72)  as was agreement between visual and quantitative classification (PiB EEE = 0.88-0.92; FDG EEE = 0.64-0.68). In patients with known histopathology  overall classification accuracy (2 visual and 1 quantitative classification per patient) was 97% for PiB (n = 12 patients) and 87% for FDG (n = 10). CONCLUSIONS: PiB and FDG showed similar accuracy in discriminating AD and FTLD. PiB was more sensitive when interpreted qualitatively or quantitatively. FDG was more specific  but only when scans were classified quantitatively. PiB slightly outperformed FDG in patients with known histopathology.,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 618}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 618}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'probability': '0.8', 'index': 618}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 618}",1,"{'judgement': 'False', 'index': 618}",0
48653,Prevalence of New Onset Anosmia in COVID-19 Patients: Is The Trend Different Between European and Indian Population?,"COVID-19 outbreak is major pandemic affecting lakhs of people all across the globe. Along with other nonspecific clinical features, reports mention anosmia to be an important symptom in COVID-19 positive patients. To study the prevalence of anosmia in confirmed COVID-19 patients, in Indian population and to ascertain its significance as a symptom of COVID 19. Study was done at a tertiary care COVID treating hospital. While eliciting detailed history from Covid-19 positive patients, all patients were asked about symptom of anosmia. Same was asked from control group of subjects who were COVID-19 negative. The history of anosmia was also elicited on discharge after the patients tested negative for COVID-19. 74 patients formed part of the study. 11 of 74 (14.8%) patients had anosmia. On using the chi square test for significance the difference was significant (p < .01), suggesting anosmia to be a significant clinical feature in COVID-19 patients. On comparing with world literature it was observed that the prevalence of anosmia is higher in European population as compared to Indian Also the symptom of anosmia improved when the patient recovered from the disease. Prevalence of new onset anosmia in Indian population with COVID-19 is 14.8%. Symptom of anosmia in present times should be considered as a important clinical feature and should raise a suspicion of COVID-19.

44691,Impairment of nonverbal recognition in Alzheimer disease: a PET O-15 study.,OBJECTIVE: To characterize deficits in nonverbal recognition memory and functional brain changes associated with these deficits in Alzheimer disease (AD). METHODS: Using O-15 PET  we studied 11 patients with AD and 17 cognitively intact elders during the combined encoding and retrieval periods of a nonverbal recognition task. Both task conditions involved recognition of line drawings of abstract shapes. In both conditions  subjects were first presented a list of shapes as study items  and then a list as test items  containing items from the study list and foils. In the titrated demand condition  the shape study list size (SLS) was adjusted prior to imaging so that each subject performed at approximately 75% recognition accuracy; difficulty during PET scanning in this condition was approximately matched across subjects. A control task was used in which SLS = 1 shape. RESULTS: During performance of the titrated demand condition  SLS averaged 4.55 (+/-1.86) shapes for patients with AD and 7.53 (+/-4.81) for healthy elderly subjects (p = 0.031). However  both groups of subjects were closely matched on performance in the titrated demand condition during PET scanning with 72.17% (+/-7.98%) correct for patients with AD and 72.25% (+/-7.03%) for elders (p = 0.979). PET results demonstrated that patients with AD showed greater mean differences between the titrated demand condition and control in areas including the left fusiform and inferior frontal regions (Brodmann areas 19 and 45). CONCLUSIONS: Relative fusiform and inferior frontal differences may reflect the Alzheimer disease (AD) patients' compensatory engagement of alternate brain regions. The strategy used by patients with AD is likely to be a general mechanism of compensation  rather than task-specific.,0,Impairment of nonverbal recognition in Alzheimer disease: a PET O-15 study.OBJECTIVE: To characterize deficits in nonverbal recognition memory and functional brain changes associated with these deficits in Alzheimer disease (AD).

This study reports the incidence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) during, respiratory complications and 30-day mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This prospective observational cohort study included 100 consecutive patients. The primary outcome measure was 14-day symptoms and/or SARS-CoV-2 test. The secondary outcome was 30-day postoperative mortality. RESULTS: A total of 100 patients comprising 35 females and 65 males, with a mean age of 52.4 years (range, 16-94 years) included 16 males aged greater than 70 years. The 51% of patients were tested during their admission for SARS-CoV-2; 5% were diagnosed/developed symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 during and until 14 days post-discharge; four were male and one female, mean age 41.2 years (range, 17-75 years), all had primary malignant bone or soft-tissue tumours, four of five had received immunosuppressive therapy pre-operatively. The 30-day mortality was 1% overall and 20% in those with SARS-CoV-2. The pulmonary complication rate was 3% overall.

32555,Estimation of incubation period distribution of COVID-19 using disease onset forward time: a novel cross-sectional and forward follow-up study,"Background: The current outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has quickly spread across countries and become a global crisis. However, one of the most important clinical characteristics in epidemiology, the distribution of the incubation period, remains unclear. Different estimates of the incubation period of COVID-19 were reported in recent published studies, but all have their own limitations. In this study, we propose a novel low-cost and accurate method to estimate the incubation distribution. Methods: We have conducted a cross-sectional and forward follow-up study by identifying those asymptomatic individuals at their time of departure from Wuhan and then following them until their symptoms developed. The renewal process is hence adopted by considering the incubation period as a renewal and the duration between departure and symptom onset as a forward recurrence time. Under mild assumptions, the observations of selected forward times can be used to consistently estimate the parameters in the distribution of the incubation period. Such a method enhances the accuracy of estimation by reducing recall bias and utilizing the abundant and readily available forward time data. Findings: The estimated distribution of forward time fits the observations in the collected data well. The estimated median of incubation period is 8.13 days (95% confidence interval [CI]: 7.37-8.91), the mean is 8.62 days (95% CI: 8.02-9.28), the 90th percentile is 14.65 days (95% CI: 14.00-15.26), and the 99th percentile is 20.59 days (95% CI: 19.47, 21.62). Compared with results in other studies, the incubation period estimated in this study is longer.

METHODS We searched the in-patient medical record database for confirmed cases of CD, PIL and ITB from 2008 to 2015 at our center, collected data on endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) from randomly-chosen patients who formed the training set, conducted univariate logistic regression analysis to summarize EUS features of CD, PIL and ITB, and created a diagnostic classification method. All cases found to have colorectal ulcers using EUS were obtained from the endoscopy database and formed the test set. We then removed the cases which were easily diagnosed, and the remaining cases formed the perplexing test set. We re-diagnosed the cases in the three sets using the classification method, determined EUS diagnostic accuracies, and adjusted the classification accordingly. Finally, the re-diagnosing and accuracy-calculating steps were repeated. RESULTS In total, 272 CD, 60 PIL and 39 ITB cases were diagnosed from 2008 to 2015 based on the in-patient database, and 200 CD, 30 PIL and 20 ITB cases were randomly chosen to form the training set.

Duration of illness showed no association to any of the examined pathologic parameters  while there was a moderate association between LB scores and neuritic Braak stages  the latter significantly increasing with age. Significant association between cerebrovascular lesions and neuritic Braak stage was seen in PDD but not in PD subjects without dementia. These data suggest an influence of Alzheimer-related lesions on the progression of the neurodegenerative process and  in particular  on cognitive decline in both PDD and DLB. On the other hand  both these factors in PD and DLB appear to be largely independent from coexistent vascular pathology  except in cases with severe cerebrovascular lesions or those related to neuritic AD pathology.

On the other hand  both these factors in PD and DLB appear to be largely independent from coexistent vascular pathology  except in cases with severe cerebrovascular lesions or those related to neuritic AD pathology. Assessment of ApoE genotype in a small number of cases showed no significant differences in the severity of Abeta plaque load and CAA except for much lower intensities in non-demented epsilon3/3 patients. Despite increasing evidence suggesting synergistic reactions between alpha-synuclein (alphaSyn)  tau and Abeta-peptides  the major protein markers of both AD and Lewy body diseases  and of both vascular pathology and AD  the molecular background and pathophysiological impact of these pathologies on the progression of neurodegeneration and development of cognitive decline in PD await further elucidation.,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 629}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 629}",1,"{'judgement': 'False', 'index': 629}",0,"{'judgement': 'False', 'index': 629}",0,"{'judgement': 'False', 'index': 629}",0
65699,"Microbleed topography, leukoaraiosis, and cognition in probable Alzheimer disease from the Sunnybrook dementia study.",BACKGROUND: Microbleeds are hemosiderin deposits around small vessels and are well visualized with T2*-weighted gradient-recalled echo (GRE) imaging. OBJECTIVES: To determine frequency and topography of microbleeds in Alzheimer disease (AD) and to assess their association with leukoaraiosis and cognition. DESIGN: Case-control cross-sectional analysis. Microbleeds were counted using GRE imaging. Leukoaraiosis was rated on T2-weighted and proton density-weighted scans using the Age-Related White Matter Changes Rating Scale (ARWMC). Neuropsychological tests indexed cognition. SETTING: The Cognitive Neurology Clinic  Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre  Toronto  Ontario  Canada. PATIENTS: Individuals with probable AD (n = 80) and healthy controls (n = 25) from a longitudinal cohort with GRE sequences as part of standard imaging protocol (2002-2006). RESULTS: Microbleeds occurred in 29% of patients with AD and 12% of controls and were multiple (> 1) in 48% of patients with AD and 33% of controls. There was lobar (vs centrencephalic) predominance in 92% of AD patients  with occipital lobes accounting for 57% of these microbleeds. The ARWMC scores (P < .005) were significantly higher in AD patients with microbleeds than in those without  and microbleeds correlated with total (r = 0.39  P = .01) and parietooccipital (r = 0.28  P < .01) ARWMC scores. We were unable to demonstrate an association between microbleeds (or leukoaraiosis) and cognitive performance. CONCLUSIONS: Occipital predominance of microbleeds with corresponding parietooccipital leukoaraiosis has not been well described in prior imaging studies of AD. Microbleeds were frequent  often multiple  and predicted greater leukoaraiosis. These findings illustrate the complexity of AD vasculopathy and the need for additional studies in dementia and stroke populations.,0,"Microbleed topography, leukoaraiosis, and cognition in probable Alzheimer disease from the Sunnybrook dementia study.BACKGROUND: Microbleeds are hemosiderin deposits around small vessels and are well visualized with T2*-weighted gradient-recalled echo (GRE) imaging.

Currently, there are no clinically proven pharmacotherapies for coronavirus disease 2019, despite promising initial results obtained from drugs such as azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine. Therefore, the repurposing of clinically approved drugs for use against SARS-CoV-2 has become a viable strategy. Here, we searched for drugs that target SARS-CoV-2 3C-like protease (3CLpro) and viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) by in silico screening of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved drug library. Well-tolerated and widely used drugs were selected for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to evaluate drug-protein interactions and their persistence under physiological conditions. Tetracycline, dihydroergotamine, ergotamine, dutasteride, nelfinavir, and paliperidone formed stable interactions with 3CLpro based on MD simulation results. Similar analysis with RdRp showed that eltrombopag, tipranavir, ergotamine, and conivaptan bound to the enzyme with high binding free energies. Docking results suggest that ergotamine, dihydroergotamine, bromocriptine, dutasteride, conivaptan, paliperidone, and tipranavir can bind to both enzymes with high affinity. As these drugs are well tolerated, cost-effective, and widely used, our study suggests that they could potentially to be used in clinical trials for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients.

34725,Neuropeptide Y fragments derived from neprilysin processing are neuroprotective in a transgenic model of Alzheimer's disease.,The endopeptidase neprilysin (NEP) is a major amyloid-beta (Abeta) degrading enzyme and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Because NEP cleaves substrates other than Abeta  we investigated the potential role of NEP-mediated processing of neuropeptides in the mechanisms of neuroprotection in vivo. Overexpression of NEP at low levels in transgenic (tg) mice affected primarily the levels of neuropeptide Y (NPY) compared with other neuropeptides. Ex vivo and in vivo studies in tg mice and in mice that received lentiviral vector injections showed that NEP cleaved NPY into C-terminal fragments (CTFs)  whereas silencing NEP reduced NPY processing. Immunoblot and mass spectrometry analysis showed that NPY 21-36 and 31-36 were the most abundant fragments generated by NEP activity in vivo. Infusion of these NPY CTFs into the brains of APP (amyloid precursor protein) tg mice ameliorated the neurodegenerative pathology in this model. Moreover  the amidated NPY CTFs protected human neuronal cultures from the neurotoxic effects of Abeta. This study supports the possibility that the NPY CTFs generated during NEP-mediated proteolysis might exert neuroprotective effects in vivo. This function of NEP represents a unique example of a proteolytic enzyme with dual action  namely  degradation of Abeta as well as processing of NPY.,0,Neuropeptide Y fragments derived from neprilysin processing are neuroprotective in a transgenic model of Alzheimer's disease.The endopeptidase neprilysin (NEP) is a major amyloid-beta (Abeta) degrading enzyme and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.

In preparing for and managing COVID-19, resettled refugees encounter similar barriers to those of other racial or ethnic minority populations, which may then be exacerbated by unique barriers experienced from being a refugee.

52037,Multitracer PET imaging of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer's disease.,Recently developed positron emission tomography (PET) tracers  such as PIB and FDDNP  help to visualize amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in living subjects. FDDNP binds to both amyloid plaques and tangles  whereas PIB selectively labels amyloid plaques. Therefore  it will be interesting to see a direct comparison of the regional binding of the two radiotracers for plaques (PIB) and plaques and tangles (FDDNP) using multitracer PET imaging for both PIB and FDDNP in the same subjects with and without Alzheimer's disease. Here we report that multitracer PET images of PIB and FDDNP in the same Alzheimer subjects show negligible PIB but strong FDDNP binding in the medial temporal cortex (hippocampus  amygdala  and parahippocampal gyrus)  whereas there are significant quantities of both PIB and FDDNP binding in neocortical areas. These results suggest that tangles rather than amyloid plaques are the dominant pathology in the medial temporal cortex of living Alzheimer patients. In nondemented elderly normal subjects  PIB binding shows a significant increase in the posterior cingulate cortex compared with other brain regions  whereas in the same normal subjects we found significant FDDNP binding in the medial temporal cortex. Interestingly  the medial temporal FDDNP uptake values in normal elderly subjects were inversely correlated with long delay recall scores in the California Verbal Learning Test  a measure of episodic memory performance.

65830,Epigenetic Regulation in Amyloid Precursor Protein with Genomic Rearrangements and the Lesch-Nyhan Syndrome.,Recently  epigenetic regulation of alternative APP pre-mRNA splicing in the Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (LNS) has been studied (see Ref. 7) and showed for the first time  the presence of several APP-mRNA isoforms encoding divers APP protein isoforms ranging from 120 to 770 amino acids (with or without mutations and/or deletions).

1276,Estimating and Projecting Air Passenger Traffic during the COVID-19 Coronavirus Outbreak and its Socio-Economic Impact,"Due to the coronavirus global crisis, most countries have put in place restrictive measures in order to confine the pandemia and contain the number of casualties. Among the restrictive measures, air traffic suspension is certainly quite effective in reducing the mobility on the global scale in the short term but it also has high socio-economic impact on the long and short term. The main focus of this study is to collect and prepare data on air passengers traffic worldwide with the scope of analyze the impact of travel ban on the aviation sector. Based on historical data from January 2010 till October 2019, a forecasting model is implemented in order to set a reference baseline. Making use of airplane movements extracted from online flight tracking platforms and on-line booking systems, this study presents also a first assessment of recent changes in flight activity around the world as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. To study the effects of air travel ban on aviation and in turn its socio-economic, several scenarios are constructed based on past pandemic crisis and the observed flight volumes. It turns out that, according to these hypothetical scenarios, in the first Quarter of 2020 the impact of aviation losses could have negatively reduced World GDP by 0.02% to 0.12% according to the observed data and, in the worst case scenarios, at the end of 2020 the loss could be as high as 1.41-1.67% and job losses may reach the value of 25-30 millions. Focusing on EU27, the GDP loss may amount to 1.66-1.98% by the end of 2020 and the number of job losses from 4.2 to 5 millions in the worst case scenarios. Some countries will be more affected than others in the short run and most European airlines companies will suffer from the travel ban. We hope that that these preliminary results may be of help for informed policy making design of exit strategies from this global crisis. Copyright ÁE© 2020 The Authors.

10041,Molecular and functional imaging technology for the development of efficient treatment strategies for gliomas,Gliomas are the most common types of brain tumors  which invariably lead to death over months or years. Before new and potentially more effective treatment strategies  such as gene therapy  can be effectively introduced into clinical application the following goals must be reached: (1) the determination of localization  extent and metabolic activity of the glioma; (2) the assessment of functional changes within the surrounding brain tissue; (3) the identification of genetic changes on the molecular level leading to disease; and in addition (4) a detailed non-invasive analysis of both endogenous and exogenous gene expression in animal models and in the clinical setting. Non-invasive imaging of endogenous gene expression by means of positron emission tomography (PET) may reveal insight into the molecular basis of pathogenesis and metabolic activity of the glioma and the extent of treatment response. When exogenous genes are introduced to serve for a therapeutic function  PET imaging techniques may reveal the assessment of the location  magnitude and duration of therapeutic gene expression and its relation to the therapeutic effect.

It is characterized by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) T2-weighted subcortical lesions  a late onset of first episode of depression  and reduced heritability; a cerebrovascular etiology is suggested. The validity of ""vascular depression"" might be strengthened if an association was found between the subcortical lesions used to define it and particular depressive symptoms. METHODS: A blinded cross-sectional examination of DSM-III-R depressive symptoms (American Psychiatric Association  1987) and MRI T2-weighted subcortical lesions in 44 patients with late-life depression. RESULTS: Many associations were found; however  because of multiple comparisons  their significance is viewed with caution. The most robust finding was that psychomotor retardation was independently related to total white-matter score. The odds of showing psychomotor retardation was increased 1.9 times for every point increase in severity of white-matter change. CONCLUSION: In late-life depression the clinical expression of the depression is influenced by the pattern of MRI T2-weighted subcortical lesions. This gives some validity to the concept of an MRI-defined ""vascular"" subtype of late-life depression and strengthens the argument for including neuroimaging in the classification of late-life depression.",0,"Is the clinical expression of late-life depression influenced by brain changes?

The goal of the present study was to elucidate the effects of APPsw on mechanisms of apoptotic cell death. Therefore  PC12 cells were stably transfected with human APPsw. Here we report that the vulnerability of APPsw-bearing PC12 cells to undergo apoptotic cell death was significantly enhanced after exposure to hydrogen peroxide compared to human wild-type APP-bearing cells  empty vector-transfected cells  and parent untransfected cells. In addition  we have analyzed the potential influence of several mechanisms that can interfere with the execution of the apoptotic cell death program: the inhibition of cell death by the use of caspase inhibitors and the reduction of oxidative stress by the use of (+/-)-alpha-tocopherol (vitamin E). Interestingly  oxidative stress-induced cell death was significantly attenuated in APPsw PC12 cells by pretreatment with caspase-3 inhibitors but not with caspase-1 inhibitors. In parallel  caspase-3 activity was markedly elevated in APPsw PC12 after stimulation with hydrogen peroxide for 6 hr  whereas caspase-1 activity was unaltered. In addition  oxidative stress-induced cell death could be reduced after pretreatment of APPsw cells with (+/-)-alpha-tocopherol. The protective potency of (+/-)-alpha-tocopherol was even greater than that of caspase-3 inhibitors. Our findings further emphasize the role of mutations in the amyloid precursor protein in apoptotic cell death and may provide the fundamental basis for further efforts to elucidate the underlying processes caused by FAD-related mutations.,0,Elevated vulnerability to oxidative stress-induced cell death and activation of caspase-3 by the Swedish amyloid precursor protein mutation.The Swedish double mutation (KM670/671NL) of amyloid precursor protein (APPsw) is associated with early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) and results in from three- to sixfold increased beta-amyloid production.

57217,N-terminal truncation of microtubule associated protein tau dysregulates its cellular localization.,Tau protein is a member of microtubule-associated protein family. Under pathological conditions  tau undergoes multiple modifications that lead to the formation of insoluble deposits in neurons  resulting in neuronal dysfunction in several neurodegenerative disorders collectively called tauopathies  with Alzheimer's disease being the most frequent example. This typical cytosolic protein has been shown to translocate into the nucleus and participate in DNA protection upon stress conditions. In our study  we demonstrate that truncated Tau151-391/4R changes its usual behavior and gains constitutive access into the nucleus of both primary rat neurons and human neuroblastoma cells. Our results show that partial/dysregulated nuclear localization of tau results from the removal of the N-terminal (1-150) residues of the protein. Data obtained by cell fractionation data were supported by confocal microscopy analysis of GFP-fused tau proteins. Furthermore  neither addition of the fusion protein  nor increased tau phosphorylation had any effect on the intracellular distribution of truncated tau. Our data further suggest that differential tau phospho-status between cytosolic and nuclear fractions is rather a consequence than a cause of truncated tau nuclear localization. Finally  truncated tau in the nucleus is engaged in interactions with subnuclear structure(s)  since it exhibits reduced mobility. We conclude that N-terminal truncation of tau proteins leads to their nonphysiological subcellular distribution as a result of modified tau conformation.,0,N-terminal truncation of microtubule associated protein tau dysregulates its cellular localization.Tau protein is a member of microtubule-associated protein family.

2077,Vitamin E protects neurons against oxidative cell death in vitro more effectively than 17-beta estradiol and induces the activity of the transcription factor NF-kappaB.,Antioxidants can function as powerful protectants for neurons in vitro. Here  the neuroprotective activity of lipophilic free radical scavengers synthetic (+/-) alpha-tocopherol (synthetic vitamin E) and natural (+) alpha-tocopherol (natural vitamin E) against oxidative stress was investigated and compared to the neuroprotective effect of the female sex hormone estradiol. Employing mouse clonal hippocampal HT22 cells and rat cerebellar granule neurons  we found that both types of alpha-tocopherol exerted a higher neuroprotective antioxidant activity than 17-beta estradiol. At concentrations as low as 100 nM  synthetic (+/-) alpha-tocopherol and natural (+) alpha-tocopherol protected neurons effectively against the oxidative cell death caused by the Alzheimer's disease-associated amyloid beta protein  hydrogen peroxide  and the excitatory amino acid glutamate. Moreover  vitamin E induced the activity of the redox-sensitive transcription factor NF-kappaB  which is involved in the control of nerve cell survival and  therefore  may play also a role in vitamin E-induced neuroprotection. These results may have implications regarding the prevention and treatment of oxidative stress-related degenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease.,0,Vitamin E protects neurons against oxidative cell death in vitro more effectively than 17-beta estradiol and induces the activity of the transcription factor NF-kappaB.Antioxidants can function as powerful protectants for neurons in vitro.

66394,Utility of 8F-FDG PET/CT in well differentiated thyroid carcinoma with high serum antithyroglobulin antibody.,OBJECTIVE: Evaluate the utility of 18F-FDG PET/CT in the follow-up of differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) patients with high serum antithyroglobulin antibody (TgAb) but negative serum thyroglobulin (Tg) measurements and negative 131I whole-body scans (WBS). MATERIAL AND METHOD: The present study included 22 consecutive patients with high serum TgAb levels. They had negative serum Tg measurements and negative 131I WBS. PET/CT was performed 60 min after intravenous injection of 227.55-455.47 MBq (6.15-12.31 mCi) of 18F-FDG using a combined PET/CT scanner. Co-registered CT images were used to differentiate physiologic from pathologic tracer uptake. Findings on 18F-FDG PET/CT were correlated with tissue pathology follow-up imaging or clinical follow-up served as a reference. RESULTS: Twenty-two well differentiated thyroid cancerpatients participated. Twelve had positive findings on 18F-FDG PET/CT six were true positives and six were false-positives. 18F-FDG PET/CT results were true negative in 10 patients and the authors found no false-negative patients in the present study. The overall sensitivity  specificity and accuracy of 18F-FDG PET/CT were 100%  62.5% and 72.7%  respectively. TgAb levels  which are appropriated for sending DTC patient who are 131I WBS negative but have elevated serum TgAb levels to undergo 18F-FDG PET/CT scan  should be more than or equal to 414.6 IU/ml. Results should be highly consider positive if max SUV value is equal or greater than 4.5. CONCLUSION: 18F-FDG PET/CT is a useful tool for localizing recurrent or metastatic DTC patients  who have negative 131I WBS but elevated serum TgAb levels. The authors recommend its use in clinical management of selected cases regardless of the TgAb level being more than or equal to 415 IU/ml.,0,Utility of 8F-FDG PET/CT in well differentiated thyroid carcinoma with high serum antithyroglobulin antibody.OBJECTIVE: Evaluate the utility of 18F-FDG PET/CT in the follow-up of differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) patients with high serum antithyroglobulin antibody (TgAb) but negative serum thyroglobulin (Tg) measurements and negative 131I whole-body scans (WBS).

Group differences were compared by t-tests and a regression analysis was calculated. RESULTS: The inter-test-correlations varied between rs = 0.77 and rs = 0.91. Significant differences between the diagnostic groups were found for all tests as well as for the frequency bands alpha and beta. For the qEEG  significant positive correlations were found between TE4D (Dementia subscore) and the mean frequency (r = 0.47)  the peak frequency (r = 0.42)  the frequency bands alpha (r = 0.59) and beta (r = 0.56) as well as negative correlations in the frequency bands delta (r = -0.23) and theta (r = -0.42). The mean frequency and the activity in the frequency bands alpha  beta2  delta and theta contributed to the regression equation. The correlation between regression equation and the TE4D was rs = 0.87. The other tests also correlated with the TE4D: ADAS rs = -0.75  MMST rs = 0.82  SKT rs = -0.74  BCRS rs = -0.83.

Patients with XHIGM usually present with a wide variety of infections caused by common and opportunistic pathogens including Pneumocystis jirovecii. In addition  subjects with XHIGM have an increased risk for hepatocellular and bile duct carcinomas  which are rarely observed in other primary immunodeficiencies. We present here clinical  immunological  and molecular findings of four patients with CD40 ligand deficiency associated with neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC). NEC developed as a rapidly disseminated solid cancer leading to death in three patients. Data presented here and published previously suggest that CD40 ligand deficiency may predispose patients for the development of NEC. Histochemical findings suggested that CD56  in addition to cytokeratin and chromogranin A  may be a useful marker for early detection of NEC.

38912,Computational guided drug repurposing for targeting 2'-O-ribose methyltransferase of SARS-CoV-2,"AIMS: The recent outbreak of pandemic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led the world towards a global health emergency. Currently, no proper medicine or effective treatment strategies are available; therefore, repurposing of FDA approved drugs may play an important role in overcoming the situation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The SARS-CoV-2 genome encodes for 2-O-methyltransferase (2'OMTase), which plays a key role in methylation of viral RNA for evading host immune system. In the present study, the protein sequence of 2'OMTase of SARS-CoV-2 was analyzed, and its structure was modeled by a comparative modeling approach and validated. The library of 3000 drugs was screened against the active site of 2'OMTase followed by re-docking analysis. The apo and ligand-bound 2'OMTase were further validated and analyzed by using molecular dynamics simulation. KEY FINDINGS: The modeled structure displayed the conserved characteristic fold of class I MTase family. The quality assessment analysis by SAVES server reveals that the modeled structure follows protein folding rules and of excellent quality. The docking analysis displayed that the active site of 2'OMTase accommodates an array of drugs, which includes alkaloids, antivirals, cardiac glycosides, anticancer, steroids, and other drugs. The redocking and MD simulation analysis of the best 5 FDA approved drugs reveals that these drugs form a stable conformation with the 2'OMTase. SIGNIFICANCE: The results suggested that these drugs may be used as potential inhibitors for 2'OMTase for combating the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Copyright ÁE© 2020.

The library of 3000 drugs was screened against the active site of 2'OMTase followed by re-docking analysis. The apo and ligand-bound 2'OMTase were further validated and analyzed by using molecular dynamics simulation. KEY FINDINGS: The modeled structure displayed the conserved characteristic fold of class I MTase family. The quality assessment analysis by SAVES server reveals that the modeled structure follows protein folding rules and of excellent quality. The docking analysis displayed that the active site of 2'OMTase accommodates an array of drugs, which includes alkaloids, antivirals, cardiac glycosides, anticancer, steroids, and other drugs. The redocking and MD simulation analysis of the best 5 FDA approved drugs reveals that these drugs form a stable conformation with the 2'OMTase. SIGNIFICANCE: The results suggested that these drugs may be used as potential inhibitors for 2'OMTase for combating the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Copyright ÁE© 2020.

64395,Targeted polyphosphatase expression alters mitochondrial metabolism and inhibits calcium-dependent cell death.,Polyphosphate (polyP) consists of tens to hundreds of phosphates  linked by ATP-like high-energy bonds. Although polyP is present in mammalian mitochondria  its physiological roles there are obscure. Here  we examine the involvement of polyP in mitochondrial energy metabolism and ion transport. We constructed a vector to express a mitochondrially targeted polyphosphatase  along with a GFP fluorescent tag. Specific reduction of mitochondrial polyP  by polyphosphatase expression  significantly modulates mitochondrial bioenergetics  as indicated by the reduction of inner membrane potential and increased NADH levels. Furthermore  reduction of polyP levels increases mitochondrial capacity to accumulate calcium and reduces the likelihood of the calcium-induced mitochondrial permeability transition  a central event in many types of necrotic cell death. This confers protection against cell death  including that induced by beta-amyloid peptide  a pathogenic agent in Alzheimer's disease. These results demonstrate a crucial role played by polyP in mitochondrial function of mammalian cells.,0,Targeted polyphosphatase expression alters mitochondrial metabolism and inhibits calcium-dependent cell death.Polyphosphate (polyP) consists of tens to hundreds of phosphates  linked by ATP-like high-energy bonds.

38159,Targeting Alzheimer's disease genes with RNA interference: an efficient strategy for silencing mutant alleles.,Tau and amyloid precursor protein (APP) are key proteins in the pathogenesis of sporadic and inherited Alzheimer's disease. Thus  developing ways to inhibit production of these proteins is of great research and therapeutic interest. The selective silencing of mutant alleles  moreover  represents an attractive strategy for treating inherited dementias and other dominantly inherited disorders. Here  using tau and APP as model targets  we describe an efficient method for producing small interfering RNA (siRNA) against essentially any targeted region of a gene. We then use this approach to develop siRNAs that display optimal allele-specific silencing against a well-characterized tau mutation (V337M) and the most widely studied APP mutation (APPsw). The allele-specific RNA duplexes identified by this method then served as templates for constructing short hairpin RNA (shRNA) plasmids that successfully silenced mutant tau or APP alleles. These plasmids should prove useful in experimental and therapeutic studies of Alzheimer's disease. Our results suggest guiding principles for the production of allele-specific siRNA  and the general method described here should facilitate the production of gene-specific siRNAs.,0,Targeting Alzheimer's disease genes with RNA interference: an efficient strategy for silencing mutant alleles.Tau and amyloid precursor protein (APP) are key proteins in the pathogenesis of sporadic and inherited Alzheimer's disease.

Buried bumper syndrome is one of the long-term complications of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy  and occurs when the internal retention bolster ulcerates the gastric mucosa  migrates into the deeper gastric wall and becomes covered by gastric mucosa. Clinically  this migration is revealed by a gradual increase of resistance at feeding administration and during catheter cleaning.

32900,Neuropathologically defined subtypes of Alzheimer's disease with distinct clinical characteristics: a retrospective study.,BACKGROUND: Neurofibrillary pathology has a stereotypical progression in Alzheimer's disease (AD) that is encapsulated in the Braak staging scheme; however  some AD cases are atypical and do not fit into this scheme. We aimed to compare clinical and neuropathological features between typical and atypical AD cases. METHODS: AD cases with a Braak neurofibrillary tangle stage of more than IV were identified from a brain bank database. By use of thioflavin-S fluorescence microscopy  we assessed the density and the distribution of neurofibrillary tangles in three cortical regions and two hippocampal sectors. These data were used to construct an algorithm to classify AD cases into typical  hippocampal sparing  or limbic predominant. Classified cases were then compared for clinical  demographic  pathological  and genetic characteristics. An independent cohort of AD cases was assessed to validate findings from the initial cohort. FINDINGS: 889 cases of AD  398 men and 491 women with age at death of 37-103 years  were classified with the algorithm as hippocampal sparing (97 cases [11%])  typical (665 [75%])  or limbic predominant (127 [14%]). By comparison with typical AD  neurofibrillary tangle counts per 0.125 mm(2) in hippocampal sparing cases were higher in cortical areas (median 13  IQR 11-16) and lower in the hippocampus (7.5  5.2-9.5)  whereas counts in limbic-predominant cases were lower in cortical areas (4.3  3.0-5.7) and higher in the hippocampus (27  22-35). Hippocampal sparing cases had less hippocampal atrophy than did typical and limbic-predominant cases. Patients with hippocampal sparing AD were younger at death (mean 72 years [SD 10]) and a higher proportion of them were men (61 [63%])  whereas those with limbic-predominant AD were older (mean 86 years [SD 6]) and a higher proportion of them were women (87 [69%]). Microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) H1H1 genotype was more common in limbic-predominant AD (54 [70%]) than in hippocampal sparing AD (24 [46%]; p=0.011)  but did not differ significantly between limbic-predominant and typical AD (204 [59%]; p=0.11). Apolipoprotein E (APOE) EE4 allele status differed between AD subtypes only when data were stratified by age at onset. Clinical presentation  age at onset  disease duration  and rate of cognitive decline differed between the AD subtypes. These findings were confirmed in a validation cohort of 113 patients with AD. INTERPRETATION: These data support the hypothesis that AD has distinct clinicopathological subtypes. Hippocampal sparing and limbic-predominant AD subtypes might account for about 25% of cases  and hence should be considered when designing clinical  genetic  biomarker  and treatment studies in patients with AD.

40043,Morphometry based on effective and accurate correspondences of localized patterns (MEACOLP).,Local features in volumetric images have been used to identify correspondences of localized anatomical structures for brain morphometry. However  the correspondences are often sparse thus ineffective in reflecting the underlying structures  making it unreliable to evaluate specific morphological differences. This paper presents a morphometry method (MEACOLP) based on correspondences with improved effectiveness and accuracy. A novel two-level scale-invariant feature transform is used to enhance the detection repeatability of local features and to recall the correspondences that might be missed in previous studies. Template patterns whose correspondences could be commonly identified in each group are constructed to serve as the basis for morphometric analysis. A matching algorithm is developed to reduce the identification errors by comparing neighboring local features and rejecting unreliable matches. The two-sample t-test is finally adopted to analyze specific properties of the template patterns. Experiments are performed on the public OASIS database to clinically analyze brain images of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and normal controls (NC). MEACOLP automatically identifies known morphological differences between AD and NC brains  and characterizes the differences well as the scaling and translation of underlying structures. Most of the significant differences are identified in only a single hemisphere  indicating that AD-related structures are characterized by strong anatomical asymmetry. In addition  classification trials to differentiate AD subjects from NC confirm that the morphological differences are reliably related to the groups of interest.,0,Morphometry based on effective and accurate correspondences of localized patterns (MEACOLP).Local features in volumetric images have been used to identify correspondences of localized anatomical structures for brain morphometry.

41284,"A learning-based wrapper method to correct systematic errors in automatic image segmentation: consistently improved performance in hippocampus, cortex and brain segmentation.",We propose a simple but generally applicable approach to improving the accuracy of automatic image segmentation algorithms relative to manual segmentations. The approach is based on the hypothesis that a large fraction of the errors produced by automatic segmentation are systematic  i.e.  occur consistently from subject to subject  and serves as a wrapper method around a given host segmentation method. The wrapper method attempts to learn the intensity  spatial and contextual patterns associated with systematic segmentation errors produced by the host method on training data for which manual segmentations are available. The method then attempts to correct such errors in segmentations produced by the host method on new images. One practical use of the proposed wrapper method is to adapt existing segmentation tools  without explicit modification  to imaging data and segmentation protocols that are different from those on which the tools were trained and tuned. An open-source implementation of the proposed wrapper method is provided  and can be applied to a wide range of image segmentation problems. The wrapper method is evaluated with four host brain MRI segmentation methods: hippocampus segmentation using FreeSurfer (Fischl et al.  2002); hippocampus segmentation using multi-atlas label fusion (Artaechevarria et al.  2009); brain extraction using BET (Smith  2002); and brain tissue segmentation using FAST (Zhang et al.  2001). The wrapper method generates 72%  14%  29% and 21% fewer erroneously segmented voxels than the respective host segmentation methods. In the hippocampus segmentation experiment with multi-atlas label fusion as the host method  the average Dice overlap between reference segmentations and segmentations produced by the wrapper method is 0.908 for normal controls and 0.893 for patients with mild cognitive impairment. Average Dice overlaps of 0.964  0.905 and 0.951 are obtained for brain extraction  white matter segmentation and gray matter segmentation  respectively.,0,"A learning-based wrapper method to correct systematic errors in automatic image segmentation: consistently improved performance in hippocampus, cortex and brain segmentation.We propose a simple but generally applicable approach to improving the accuracy of automatic image segmentation algorithms relative to manual segmentations.

56879,Urinary Viral Shedding of COVID-19 and its Clinical Associations: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Observational Studies,"OBJECTIVES: To review the current literature on the presence of COVID-19 virus in the urine of infected patients and to explore the clinical features that can predict the presence of COVID-19 in urine. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic review of published literature between 30th December 2019 and 21st June 2020 was conducted on Pubmed, Google Scholar, Ovid, Scopus, and ISI web of science. Studies investigating urinary viral shedding of COVID-19 in infected patients were included. Two reviewers selected relative studies and performed quality assessment of individual studies. Meta-analysis was performed on the pooled case reports and cohort with a sample size of >= 9. RESULTS: Thirty-nine studies were finally included in the systematic review; 12 case reports, 26 case series, and one cohort study. Urinary samples from 533 patients were investigated. Fourteen studies reported the presence of COVID-19 in the urinary samples from 24 patients. The crude overall rate of COVID-19 detection in urinary samples was 4.5%. Considering case series and cohorts with a sample size of >= 9, the estimated viral shedding frequency was 1.18 % (CI 95%: 0.14 - 2.87) in the meta-analysis. In adult patients, urinary shedding of COVID-19 was commonly detected in patients with moderate to severe disease (16 adult patients with moderate or severe disease versus two adult patients with mild disease). In children, urinary viral shedding of COVID-19 was reported in 4 children who all suffered from mild disease. Urinary viral shedding of COVID-19 was detected from day 1 to day 52 after disease onset. The pathogenicity of virus isolated from urine has been demonstrated in cell culture media in one study while another study failed to reveal replication of isolated viral RNA in cell cultures. Urinary symptoms were not attributed to urinary viral shedding. CONCLUSION: While COVID-19 is rarely detected in urine of infected individuals, infection transmission through urine still remains possible. In adult patients, infected urine is more likely in the presence of moderate or severe disease. Therefore, caution should be exerted when dealing with COVID-19 infected patients during medical interventions like endoscopy and urethral catheterization.",0,"Urinary Viral Shedding of COVID-19 and its Clinical Associations: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Observational StudiesOBJECTIVES: To review the current literature on the presence of COVID-19 virus in the urine of infected patients and to explore the clinical features that can predict the presence of COVID-19 in urine.

66793,Cutaneous manifestations in patients with covid-19 in the practice of emergency medical care,"Currently, information about the epidemiology, clinical features, prevention and treatment of coronavirus infection affected by SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) is constantly updated and updated. The most common clinical manifestations of COVID-19 are fever, symptoms of intoxication, cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, chest congestion, decreased sense of smell and taste, less often - abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, and others. For the current period, there are data from clinical observations describing skin lesions in the new COVID-19 coronavirus infection. One of the first descriptions of skin manifestations in COVID-19 was published by the Italian dermatologist Recalcati S. (2020), who provided data on possible types of skin lesions as a variant of the manifestation of a new COVID-19 coronavirus infection. This paper presents the confirmed cases COVID-19 infection with skin lesions, from the practice of specialists of mobile teams of emergency medical care state budgetary institution <<Station of emergency medical care to them.

In the initial period of the disease, when examining patients, various morphological elements were observed: papulo-vesicular, papulo-squamous, erythematous, urticary, and others, their localization was also different. Whether the described changes on the skin are associated with direct exposure to the pathogen COVID-19 or are a manifestation of secondary pathogenetic factors (infectious-allergic, allergic, toxic, etc.) is not currently known. Further accumulation of clinical observations of skin manifestations in this disease is necessary in order to analyze and evaluate their diagnostic and prognostic value.Copyright ÁE© 2020 SINAPS LLC.

13008,COMT Val158Met genotype influences neurodegeneration within dopamine-innervated brain structures.,OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine whether the Val(158)Met polymorphism in the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene influences neurodegeneration within dopamine-innervated brain regions. METHODS: A total of 252 subjects  including healthy controls and patients with Alzheimer disease  behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia  and semantic dementia  underwent COMT genotyping and structural MRI. RESULTS: Whole-brain voxel-wise regression analyses revealed that COMT Val(158)Met Val allele dosage  known to produce a dose-dependent decrease in synaptic dopamine (DA) availability  correlated with decreased gray matter in the region of the ventral tegmental area (VTA)  ventromedial prefrontal cortex  bilateral dorsal midinsula  left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex  and right ventral striatum. Unexpectedly  patients carrying a Met allele showed greater VTA volumes than age-matched controls.

53120,Treatment with a herbal formula B401 enhances neuroprotection and angiogenesis in the R6/2 mouse model of Huntington's disease.,Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by motor dysfunction and early death. Despite years of research  the mechanisms responsible for chronic neurodegeneration of HD remain elusive. Chinese traditional medicines might provide new insights or new therapy for HD. The Chinese herbal formula B401 is a well-known Taiwan-US patent formula and a health supplement for promoting blood circulation and enhancing brain function. This study aimed to elucidate the neuroprotective effects of the Chinese herbal formula B401 on the syndrome of HD. Then  we compared the life span and body weight of R6/2 HD mice with and without oral B401 treatment. The ameliorative effects of B401 on the symptom of HD mice were investigated through behavior tests. Expressions of proteins for neuroprotection  angiogenesis  and inflammation in the brain tissue of R6/2 HD mice were compared by using immunostaining and Western blotting techniques. Our study in vitro showed that viabilities of glutamate-treated SH-SY5Y cells were significantly increased under B401 treatment. Our results in vivo showed that duration of survival was increased  body weight loss was reduced  and motor ability was improved in R6/2 HD mice under oral B401 treatment. Subcutaneous microcirculation was enhanced in 3-month R6/2 HD mice under intraperitoneal B401 injections as observed by using moorFLPI laser Doppler imager. Atrophy of cerebrum  midbrain  and cerebellum in 3-month R6/2 HD mice under oral B401 treatment was alleviated as observed by utilizing magnetic resonance imaging. Evidence from immunostaining and Western blotting analysis showed that expressions of mutant huntingtin and tumor necrosis factor-alpha were reduced  while expressions of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and vascular endothelial growth factor were enhanced in the brain tissue of 2-month R6/2 HD mice under oral B401 treatment. We suggest that the herbal formula B401 can be developed as a medical supplement for ameliorating neurodegenerative diseases of HD via reducing mutant huntingtin aggregation and excitotoxicity  enhancing neuroprotection and angiogenesis  and alleviating inflammation in the brain.,0,Treatment with a herbal formula B401 enhances neuroprotection and angiogenesis in the R6/2 mouse model of Huntington's disease.Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by motor dysfunction and early death.

67625,Treatment options for limited or symptomatic metastatic melanoma,BACKGROUND: Patients who develop metastatic melanoma often have limited effective treatment options. However  a select group of patients will benefit from aggressive surgery or a multidisciplinary approach  depending on the site of metastasis. METHODS: The current literature was reviewed and summarized regarding the collective recommendations for staging and treating patients with metastatic melanoma. RESULTS: A thorough preoperative staging includes positron-emission tomography  MRI of the brain  and CT of the chest  abdomen  and pelvis. Tumor biology ultimately determines the success of intervention. A long disease-free interval is a good indicator of potential benefit from resection of metastatic disease. If surgery is performed  no less than a complete resection will affect the overall survival of the patient. Surgery and other multimodality treatment options can be used for symptomatic palliation but will not affect survival. Chemotherapy and radiation are often used to control the symptoms of brain and bony metastases but have limited if any impact on survival. CONCLUSIONS: A select group of patients with metastatic melanoma will benefit from aggressive surgery. Identifying which patients will benefit from treatment requires good clinical judgment and a thorough radiologic evaluation to identify the true extent of disease,0,Treatment options for limited or symptomatic metastatic melanomaBACKGROUND: Patients who develop metastatic melanoma often have limited effective treatment options.

67012,Universal Shelter-in-Place Versus Advanced Automated Contact Tracing and Targeted Isolation: A Case for 21st-Century Technologies for SARS-CoV-2 and Future Pandemics,"OBJECTIVE: To model and compare effect of digital contact tracing versus shelter-in-place on severe acute respiratory syndrome - coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spread. METHODS: Using a classical epidemiologic framework and parameters estimated from literature published between February 1, 2020, and May 25, 2020, we modeled two non-pharmacologic interventions - shelter-in-place and digital contact tracing - to curb spread of SARS-CoV-2. For contact tracing, we assumed an advanced automated contact tracing (AACT) application that sends alerts to individuals advising self-isolation based on individual exposure profile. Model parameters included percentage population ordered to shelter-in-place, adoption rate of AACT, and percentage individuals who appropriately follow recommendations. Under influence of these variables, the number of individuals infected, exposed, and isolated were estimated. RESULTS: Without any intervention, a high rate of infection (>10 million) with early peak is predicted. Shelter-in-place results in rapid decline in infection rate at the expense of impacting a large population segment. The AACT model achieves reduction in infected and exposed individuals similar to shelter-in-place without impacting a large number of individuals. For example, a 50% AACT adoption rate mimics a shelter-in-place order for 40% of the population and results in a greater than 90% decrease in peak number of infections. However, as compared to shelter-in-place, with AACT significantly fewer individuals would be isolated. CONCLUSION: Wide adoption of digital contact tracing can mitigate infection spread similar to universal shelter-in-place, but with considerably fewer individuals isolated.

45430,The assessment of lifestyle changes during the COVID-19 pandemic using a multidimensional scale,"INTRODUCTION: Healthy lifestyles are relevant to several diseases and to maintain individuals' mental health. Exposure to epidemics and confinement have been consistently associated with psychological consequences, but changes on lifestyle behaviours remain under-researched. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An online survey was conducted among the general population living in Spain during the COVID-19 home-isolation. In addition to demographic and clinical data, participants self-reported changes in seven lifestyle domains. The Short Multidimensional Inventory Lifestyle Evaluation was developed specifically to evaluate changes during the confinement (SMILE-C). RESULTS: A total of 1254 individuals completed the survey over the first week of data collection. The internal consistency of the SMILE-C to assess lifestyles during confinement was shown (Cronbach's Alpha=0.747). Most participants reported substantial changes on outdoor time (93.6%) and physical activity (70.2%). Moreover, about one third of subjects reported significant changes on stress management, social support, and restorative sleep. Several demographic and clinical factors were associated to lifestyle scores. In the multivariate model, those independently associated with a healthier lifestyle included substantial changes on stress management (p<0.001), social support (p=0.001) and outdoor time (p<0.001), amongst others. In contrast, being an essential worker (p=0.001), worse self-rated health (p<0.001), a positive screening for depression/anxiety (p<0.001), and substantial changes on diet/nutrition (p<0.001) and sleep (p<0.001) were all associated with poorer lifestyles. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, sizable proportions of participants reported meaningful changes in lifestyle behaviours during the COVID-19 pandemic in Spain. Moreover, the SMILE-C was sensitive to detect these changes and presented good initial psychometric properties.

14604,Estrogen stimulates degradation of beta-amyloid peptide by up-regulating neprilysin.,Postmenopausal estrogen depletion is a characterized risk factor for Alzheimer disease (AD)  a human disorder linked to high levels of beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) in brain tissue. Previous studies suggest that estrogen negatively regulates the level of Abeta in the brain  but the molecular mechanism is unknown. Here  we provide evidence that estrogen promotes Abeta degradation mainly through a principal Abeta degrading enzyme  neprilysin  in neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. We also demonstrate that up-regulation of neprilysin by estrogen is dependent on both estrogen receptor alpha and beta (ERalpha and ERbeta)  and ligand-activated ER regulates expression of neprilysin through physical interactions between ER and estrogen response elements (EREs) identified in the neprilysin gene. These results were confirmed by in vitro gel shift and in vivo chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses  which demonstrate specific binding of ERalpha and ERbeta to two putative EREs in the neprilysin gene. The EREs also enhance ERalpha- and ERbeta-dependent reporter gene expression in a yeast model system. Therefore  the study described here provides a putative mechanism by which estrogen positively regulates expression of neprilysin to promote degradation of Abeta  reducing risk for AD. These results may lead to novel approaches to prevent or treat AD.,0,Estrogen stimulates degradation of beta-amyloid peptide by up-regulating neprilysin.Postmenopausal estrogen depletion is a characterized risk factor for Alzheimer disease (AD)  a human disorder linked to high levels of beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) in brain tissue.

48777,Effect of hydrocortisone on mortality and organ support in patients with severe COVID-19: The REMAP-CAP COVID-19 corticosteroid domain randomized clinical trial,"Importance: Evidence regarding corticosteroid use for severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is limited. Objective(s): To determine whether hydrocortisone improves outcome for patients with severe COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participant(s): An ongoing adaptive platform trial testing multiple interventions within multiple therapeutic domains, for example, antiviral agents, corticosteroids, or immunoglobulin. Between March 9 and June 17, 2020, 614 adult patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 were enrolled and randomized within at least 1 domain following admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) for respiratory or cardiovascular organ support at 121 sites in 8 countries. Of these, 403 were randomized to open-label interventions within the corticosteroid domain. The domain was halted after results from another trial were released. Follow-up ended August 12, 2020. Intervention(s): The corticosteroid domain randomized participants to a fixed 7-day course of intravenous hydrocortisone (50 mg or 100 mg every 6 hours) (n = 143), a shock-dependent course (50 mg every 6 hours when shock was clinically evident) (n = 152), or no hydrocortisone (n = 108). Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary end point was organ support-free days (days alive and free of ICU-based respiratory or cardiovascular support) within 21 days, where patients who died were assigned -1 day. The primary analysis was a bayesian cumulative logistic model that included all patients enrolled with severe COVID-19, adjusting for age, sex, site, region, time, assignment to interventions within other domains, and domain and intervention eligibility. Superiority was defined as the posterior probability of an odds ratio greater than 1 (threshold for trial conclusion of superiority >99%). Result(s): After excluding 19 participants who withdrew consent, there were 384 patients (mean age, 60 years; 29% female) randomized to the fixed-dose (n = 137), shock-dependent (n = 146), and no (n = 101) hydrocortisone groups; 379 (99%) completed the study and were included in the analysis. The mean age for the 3 groups ranged between 59.5 and 60.4 years; most patients were male (range, 70.6%-71.5%); mean body mass index ranged between 29.7 and 30.9; and patients receiving mechanical ventilation ranged between 50.0% and 63.5%. For the fixed-dose, shock-dependent, and no hydrocortisone groups, respectively, the median organ support-free days were 0 (IQR, -1 to 15), 0 (IQR, -1 to 13), and 0 (-1 to 11) days (composed of 30%, 26%, and 33% mortality rates and 11.5, 9.5, and 6 median organ support-free days among survivors). The median adjusted odds ratio and bayesian probability of superiority were 1.43 (95% credible interval, 0.91-2.27) and 93% for fixed-dose hydrocortisone, respectively, and were 1.22 (95% credible interval, 0.76-1.94) and 80% for shock-dependent hydrocortisone compared with no hydrocortisone. Serious adverse events were reported in 4 (3%), 5 (3%), and 1 (1%) patients in the fixed-dose, shock-dependent, and no hydrocortisone groups, respectively. Conclusions and Relevance: Among patients with severe COVID-19, treatment with a 7-day fixed-dose course of hydrocortisone or shock-dependent dosing of hydrocortisone, compared with no hydrocortisone, resulted in 93% and 80% probabilities of superiority with regard to the odds of improvement in organ support-free days within 21 days.

44104,Structural basis for recognition of the RNA major groove in the tau exon 10 splicing regulatory element by aminoglycoside antibiotics.,Drug-like molecules that bind RNA with sequence selectivity would provide valuable tools to elucidate gene expression pathways and new avenues to the treatment of degenerative and chronic conditions. Efforts at discovering such agents have been hampered  until recently  by the limited knowledge of RNA recognition principles. Several recent structures of aminoglycoside-RNA complexes have begun to reveal the structural basis for RNA-drug recognition. However  the absence of suitable chemical scaffolds known to bind the RNA major groove  where specificity could be provided by the diversity of functional groups exposed on the RNA bases  has represented a major obstacle. Here we report an investigation of the structural basis for recognition of an RNA stem-loop by neomycin  a naturally occurring aminoglycoside antibiotic. We found that neomycin binds the RNA stem-loop that regulates alternative splicing of exon 10 within the gene coding for human tau protein. Mutations within this splicing regulatory element destabilise the RNA structure and cause frontotemporal dementia and Parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17)  an autosomal dominant condition leading to neurodegeneration and death. The three-dimensional structure of the RNA-neomycin complex shows interaction of the drug in the major groove of the short RNA duplex  where familial mutations cluster. Analysis of the structure shows how aminoglycosides and related drugs bind to the RNA major groove  adding to our understanding of the principles of drug-RNA recognition.,0,Structural basis for recognition of the RNA major groove in the tau exon 10 splicing regulatory element by aminoglycoside antibiotics.Drug-like molecules that bind RNA with sequence selectivity would provide valuable tools to elucidate gene expression pathways and new avenues to the treatment of degenerative and chronic conditions.

PET correctly demonstrated 30 metastases in lung  brain  pancreas  nasal cavity  skin and subcutaneous tissue  and lymph nodes. It detected 97% of all metastases exceeding its spatial resolution (> 5 mm). Two cutaneous metastases (approximately 3 mm) did not show increased FDG uptake; the overall detection sensitivity was 91%. Two false-positive lesions in one patient were due to severe wound infection. PET correctly excluded malignancy in four cases where suspicious lesions were found with conventional cross-sectional imaging modalities but later ruled out by fine-needle biopsy. PET therefore proved to be an excellent method for staging of metastatic melanoma. Due to its high sensitivity for malignant lesions and the possibility of covering the whole body in one examination  it can replace staging techniques employing multiple imaging modalities: chest X-ray  ultrasonography and computed tomography.

40226,Impaired memory and executive function associated with decreased medial temporal and prefrontal blood flow in Clinical Dementia Rating 0.5 status: the Osaki-Tajiri project.,AIM: The Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) is an assessment of dementia severity based on observations of activities of daily living  and a CDR of 0.5 (CDR 0.5) represents questionable dementia. A combination of the Cognitive Abilities Screening Instrument (CASI) and the Trail Making Test (TMT) scores discriminated CDR 0.5 subjects from healthy participants with a high degree of accuracy. We investigated the neurological background of CDR 0.5 subjects by correlating CASI and TMT scores with regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) as measured by single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). METHODS: From a community-based cohort  22 CDR 0.5 participants were recruited. CASI and TMT scores  rCBF measure using [(123) I]-N-isopropyl-p-iodoamphetamine and SPECT were obtained. We evaluated the relationships between the CASI domain scores  between TMT scores and rCBF in a regions-of-interest-based analysis  and voxel-based analysis using Statistical Parametric Mapping 5 software. RESULTS: We found that lower rCBF in the left medial temporal cortex correlated with a decreased CASI domain recent memory score both in the regions-of-interest and statistical parametric mapping analysis. In both the regions-of-interest and statistical parametric mapping analysis  the rCBF in the left prefrontal cortex correlated with CASI domain remote memory and mental manipulation and concentration. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that some CDR 0.5 subjects have functional impairments in the medial temporal lobe as well as in the prefrontal cortex  as reflected in the cognitive decline measured by CASI and TMT.,0,Impaired memory and executive function associated with decreased medial temporal and prefrontal blood flow in Clinical Dementia Rating 0.5 status: the Osaki-Tajiri project.AIM: The Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) is an assessment of dementia severity based on observations of activities of daily living  and a CDR of 0.5 (CDR 0.5) represents questionable dementia.

Although cerebral white matter (WM) damage predicts cognitive function in CAD  conventional neuroimaging measures only partially explain the effect of CAD on cognition. The purpose of this study was to determine if WM microstructural integrity and CAD using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) correlates with cognitive function in older adults with CAD. METHODS: Forty-nine CAD patients (66 EEE 7 years old  86% male) underwent neurocognitive assessments using the cognitive battery recommended by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke-Canadian Stroke Network for the study of vascular cognitive impairment. Composite scores for each cognitive domain were calculated. Microstructural integrity in normal-appearing WM was quantified as fractional anisotropy (FA) using DTI in nine bilateral and two interhemispheric WM tracts from the Johns Hopkins University WM Tractography Atlas. Linear regression models examined associations between FA and cognitive performance  controlling for age  sex  and education  with correction for multiple comparisons using a false discovery rate of 5%.

53985,Cholinesterase inhibitor use does not significantly influence the ability of 123I-FP-CIT imaging to distinguish Alzheimer's disease from dementia with Lewy bodies.,BACKGROUND: 123I-labelled 2beta-carbomethoxy-3beta-(4-iodophenyl)-N-(3-fluoropropyl) nortropane (123I-FP-CIT) imaging is a diagnostic tool to help differentiate dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) from Alzheimer's disease (AD). However  in animals  cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEi) have been reported to reduce radioligand binding to the striatal dopamine transporter. As ChEi are frequently used in people with dementia  it is important to determine whether their use affects 123I-FP-CIT uptake in the striatum. OBJECTIVE: To clarify whether chronic ChEi therapy modulates striatal dopamine transporter binding measured by 123I-FP-CIT in patients with AD  DLB and Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD). DESIGN: Cross sectional study in 99 patients with AD (nine on ChEi  25 not on ChEi)  DLB (nine on ChEi  19 not on ChEi) and PDD (six on ChEi  31 not on ChEi) comparing 123I-FP-CIT striatal binding (caudate  anterior and posterior putamen) in patients receiving compared with those not receiving ChEi  correcting for key clinical variables including diagnosis  age  sex  Mini-Mental State Examination score  severity of parkinsonism and concurrent antidepressant use. RESULTS: As previously described  123I-FP-CIT striatal uptake was lower in DLB and PDD subjects compared with those with AD. Median duration of ChEi use was 180 days. 123I-FP-CIT uptake was not significantly reduced in subjects receiving ChEi compared those not receiving ChEi (mean percentage reduction: AD 4.3%; DLB 0.7%; PDD 6.1%; p = 0.40). ChEi use did not differentially affect striatal 123FP-CIT uptake between patient groups (p = 0.83).

22441,A semantic network approach to measuring sentiment,"Sentiment research is dominated by studies that assign texts to positive and negative categories. This classification is often based on a bag-of-words approach that counts the frequencies of sentiment terms from a predefined vocabulary, ignoring the contexts for these words. We test an aspect-based network analysis model that computes sentiment about an entity from the shortest paths between the sentiment words and the target word across a corpus. Two ground-truth datasets in which human annotators judged whether tweets were positive or negative enabled testing the internal and external validity of the automated network-based method, evaluating the extent to which this approach's scoring corresponds to the annotations. We found that tweets annotated as negative had an automated negativity score that was nearly twice as strong than positivity, while positively annotated tweets were six times stronger in positivity than negativity. To assess the predictive validity of the approach, we analyzed sentiment associated with coronavirus coverage in television news from January 1 to March 25, 2020. Support was found for the four hypotheses tested, demonstrating the utility of the approach. H1: broadcast news expresses less sentiment about coronavirus, panic, and social distancing than non-broadcast news outlets. H2: there is a negative bias in the news across channels. H3: sentiment increases are associated with an increased volume of news stories. H4: sentiment is associated with uncertainty in news coverage of coronavirus over time. We also found that as the type of channel moved from broadcast network news to 24-h business, general, and foreign news sentiment increased for coronavirus, panic, and social distancing.

57946,"Amyloid seeds formed by cellular uptake, concentration, and aggregation of the amyloid-beta peptide.",One of the neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the amyloid plaque  primarily composed of aggregated amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide. In vitro  Abeta(1-42)  the major alloform of Abeta found in plaques  self-assembles into fibrils at micromolar concentrations and acidic pH. Such conditions do not exist in the extracellular fluid of the brain where the pH is neutral and Abeta concentrations are in the nanomolar range. Here  we show that extracellular soluble Abeta (sAbeta) at concentrations as low as 1 nM was taken up by murine cortical neurons and neuroblastoma (SHSY5Y) cells but not by human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells. Following uptake  Abeta accumulated in Lysotracker-positive acidic vesicles (likely late endosomes or lysosomes) where effective concentrations (>2.5 microM) were greater than two orders of magnitude higher than that in the extracellular fluid (25 nM)  as quantified by fluorescence intensity using laser scanning confocal microscopy. Furthermore  SHSY5Y cells incubated with 1 muM Abeta(1-42) for several days demonstrated a time-dependent increase in intracellular high molecular weight (HMW) (>200 kDa) aggregates  which were absent in cells grown in the presence of Abeta(1-40). Homogenates from these Abeta(1-42)-loaded cells were capable of seeding amyloid fibril growth. These results demonstrate that Abeta can be taken up by certain cells at low physiologically relevant concentrations of extracellular Abeta  and then concentrated into endosomes/lysosomes. At high concentrations  vesicular Abeta aggregates to form HMW species which are capable of seeding amyloid fibril growth. We speculate that extrusion of these aggregates may seed extracellular amyloid plaque formation during AD pathogenesis.,0,"Amyloid seeds formed by cellular uptake, concentration, and aggregation of the amyloid-beta peptide.One of the neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the amyloid plaque  primarily composed of aggregated amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide.

61089,Perforated Meckel's diverticulum presenting with combined bowel and urinary obstruction and mimicking Crohn's disease: A case report,"Introduction: Meckel's diverticulum is a common congenital anomaly of the gastrointestinal tract, but is an uncommon cause of serious complications in adults. Although cases of patients with hemorrhage, bowel obstruction or perforation associated with Meckel's diverticulum have been reported, there have been no prior reports of patients with combined urinary and bowel obstruction due to abscess formation. Case Presentation: We describe the case of a 21-year-old man with a history of recurrent papillary thyroid cancer, but no prior abdominal surgeries, who presented with a one-month history of rectal pain and new-onset obstipation with urinary retention. He reported night sweats and weight loss, and had a second-degree relative with known Crohn's disease. A digital rectal examination was notable and revealed marked tenderness with proximal induration. A computed tomography scan of the patient's abdomen revealed a large, complex, circumferential perirectal abscess compressing the rectal lumen and base of the urinary bladder, associated with terminal ileal thickening and an ileocecal fistula. A flexible sigmoidoscopy with an endorectal ultrasound scan displayed a complex abscess with extensive mucosal and surrounding inflammation. An exploratory laparotomy revealed a Meckel's diverticulum with a large perforation at its base, positioned near the ileocecal fistula and immediately superior to the perirectal abscess. The section of small bowel containing the Meckel's diverticulum, the terminal ileum, and the cecum, were all resected, and the abscess was debrided. Conclusions: Pre-operative diagnosis of Meckel's diverticulum can be difficult. If the nature of the complication makes ultimate surgical management likely, an early laparoscopic or open exploration should be performed to prevent the morbidity and mortality associated with late complications.",0,"Perforated Meckel's diverticulum presenting with combined bowel and urinary obstruction and mimicking Crohn's disease: A case reportIntroduction: Meckel's diverticulum is a common congenital anomaly of the gastrointestinal tract, but is an uncommon cause of serious complications in adults.

The Alzheimer's Disease Anti-inflammatory Prevention Trial (ADAPT) randomized 2 528 elderly persons to naproxen or celecoxib versus placebo for 2 years (standard deviation = 11 months) before treatments were terminated. During the treatment interval  32 cases of AD revealed increased rates in both NSAID-assigned groups. METHODS: We continued the double-masked ADAPT protocol for 2 additional years to investigate incidence of AD (primary outcome). We then collected cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from 117 volunteer participants to assess their ratio of CSF tau to AEEE(1-42.) RESULTS: Including 40 new events observed during follow-up of 2 071 randomized individuals (92% of participants at treatment cessation)  there were 72 AD cases. Overall  NSAID-related harm was no longer evident  but secondary analyses showed that increased risk remained notable in the first 2.5 years of observations  especially in 54 persons enrolled with cognitive impairment--no dementia (CIND). These same analyses showed later reduction in AD incidence among asymptomatic enrollees who were given naproxen.

METHODS: Our data stem from an adult cohort created to prospectively investigate the relationship between diet and morbidity and mortality from chronic non-communicable diseases in Brazil. For this study, we selected the first participants (n = 10,116) who answered twice to a simplified questionnaire on their diet the day before, the first time when entering the study, between January 26 and February 15, 2020, and the second between May 10 and 19, 2020. The questionnaire inquiries about the consumption of healthy (vegetables, fruits and legumes) and unhealthy (ultra-processed foods) eating markers. Comparisons of indicators based on the consumption of these markers before and during the pandemic are presented for the study population and according to gender, age group, macro-region of residence and schooling. Chi-square tests and t-tests were used to compare proportions and means, respectively, adopting p < 0.05 to identify significant differences. RESULTS: For all participants, we found a modest but statistically significant increase in the consumption of healthy eating markers and stability in the consumption of unhealthy food markers. This favorable pattern of dietary changes during the pandemic occurred in most sociodemographic strata. We observed a less favorable changing pattern, with a tendency to increasing consumption of healthy and unhealthy food markers, in the Northeast and North macro-regions and among people with less schooling, suggesting social inequalities in the response to the pandemic.

However  few studies have demonstrated decline rates in cognition and hippocampal volume in MCI subjects with stable clinical presentation. Furthermore  the effects of apolipoprotein E (ApoE) on the change rates of medial temporal structures and cognition in MCI are rarely investigated. Fifty-eight subjects with amnestic MCI and 20 normal aging elderly controls received annual neuropsychological and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) assessments. Annual decline rates in neuropsychological test scores  hippocampal and amygdalar volumes were calculated. ApoE genotypes were examined. Nineteen (32.7%) MCI subjects converted to AD during an average 22.5-month follow-up period. The annual hippocampal atrophy rate was correlated with a decline in memory test scores. The presence of the ApoE varepsilon4 allele did not affect the change rates in neuropsychological test scores and medial temporal structures volume. Compared to subjects with stable MCI (MCI-S) and normal aging  progressive MCI (MCI-P) had the highest annual decline rates in cognition and hippocampal volume. Logistic regression analysis showed that higher annual decline rates in hippocampal volume and global cognitive test scores were associated with conversion to AD. Furthermore  although MCI-S subjects had little cognitive decline  their hippocampal atrophy rates were higher than those of normal aging controls. Therefore  accelerated hippocampal atrophy rates may be an early and important presentation in MCI subjects.,0,Accelerated hippocampal atrophy rates in stable and progressive amnestic mild cognitive impairment.Studies suggest that smaller hippocampal volume predicts Alzheimer's disease (AD) in mild cognitive impairment (MCI).

8938,Crohn Disease: Correlation of Findings at Contrast-enhanced US with Severity at Endoscopy,"Purpose: To evaluate the effectiveness of visualization of vascularization at contrast material-enhanced ultrasonography (US) for assessment of the activity of Crohn disease, with severity grade determined at endoscopy as the reference standard.     Materials and Methods: Ethics committee approval and written informed consent were obtained. Sixty-one patients (age range, 21-67 years; median age, 36 years) who had Crohn disease underwent both colonoscopy and US, including color Doppler and contrast-enhanced US, prospectively. To assess the vascularization of the involved bowel loop in a region expected to be seen at colonoscopy, the contrast agent uptake was measured by using quantitative analysis of the enhancement in regions of interest. Measurement of contrast enhancement was assessed as the increase in wall brightness with respect to the baseline brightness. Results were compared with the severity grade determined at endoscopy by using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and logistic regression analysis.     Results: Colonoscopy showed inflammatory lesions in 53 patients (mild disease, seven; moderate disease, 12; and severe disease, 34). Bowel wall thickness and grade at color Doppler US (P = .019 and .002, respectively) correlated with severity grade at endoscopy. Mural contrast enhancement in patients with active disease at endoscopy was markedly increased in comparison with enhancement in patients with inactive disease (P = .001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that an increase in wall brightness was a significant and independent variable predictive of severity grade at endoscopy. A threshold brightness value of percentage of increase of 46% had a sensitivity and specificity of 96% and 73%, respectively, in the prediction of moderate or severe grade for inflammation at endoscopy.     Conclusion: Quantitative measurements of bowel enhancement obtained by using contrast-enhanced US correlate with severity grade determined at endoscopy. Contrast-enhanced US could be a useful technique to monitor the activity of Crohn disease.

6498,Clostridium difficile infection is associated with persistent increased mortality in patients with ulcerative colitis: Results of a nationwide analysis,"Introduction: Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) has been associated with worse outcomes in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC): from increased resource utilization to increased mortality. No study has addressed the impact of a previous CDI on outcomes among UC patients. Therefore, the aim of this study was to explore the current magnitude of the impact that previous or currnet episode of CDI has on UC. Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study using the 2013 National Inpatient Sample, the largest publically available inpatient database in the US. All patients with a principal ICD-9 CM diagnosis code for UC were included. There were no exclusion criteria. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes were morbidity measured by need for colectomy, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, shock and multi-organ failure; resource utilization measured by colonoscopy, abdominal CT scan, abdominal ultrasound (US), total parenteral nutrition (TPN), length of hospital stay (LOS) and total hospitalization charges. Patients were classified as having CDI and being CDI-free using ICD-9 CM codes. Using multivariate regression analysis, odds ratios and means were adjusted for age, sex, race, median income in the patient's zip code, Charlson Comorbidity Index, hospital region, urban location, size and teaching status. Results: 37,610 patients with UC were included, 1,675 (4.5%) of whom had CDI. Mean age was 45 years and 52% were female. The in-hospital mortality rate was 0.5% (3% in the CDI subgroup). Table 1 shows all adjusted odds ratios, means and p-values. On multivariate analysis, patients with CDI had higher mortality (OR:7.81, 95%CI:3.14-19.39, p < 0.01) compared to CDI-free patients. Looking at morbidity, patients with CDI had significantly increased odds of shock, ICU admission, and multi-organ failure. Colectomy rates did not significantly differ among the two groups. Both groups did not differ in abdominal CT, abdominal ultrasound or colonoscopy use. Further, total charges and LOS were significantly higher in patients with CDI. Conclusion: A previous or current episode of CDI is associated with increased mortality among patients with UC. This rate has been increasing over the past decade. Furthermore, CDI is associated with worse disease course as measured by rates of ICU admission, shock and multi-organ failure. CDI also has a direct negative impact on resource utilization, as measured by increased odds of abdominal CT use, LOS and total hospitalization charges.

No study has addressed the impact of a previous CDI on outcomes among UC patients. Therefore, the aim of this study was to explore the current magnitude of the impact that previous or currnet episode of CDI has on UC. Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study using the 2013 National Inpatient Sample, the largest publically available inpatient database in the US. All patients with a principal ICD-9 CM diagnosis code for UC were included. There were no exclusion criteria. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes were morbidity measured by need for colectomy, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, shock and multi-organ failure; resource utilization measured by colonoscopy, abdominal CT scan, abdominal ultrasound (US), total parenteral nutrition (TPN), length of hospital stay (LOS) and total hospitalization charges. Patients were classified as having CDI and being CDI-free using ICD-9 CM codes. Using multivariate regression analysis, odds ratios and means were adjusted for age, sex, race, median income in the patient's zip code, Charlson Comorbidity Index, hospital region, urban location, size and teaching status. Results: 37,610 patients with UC were included, 1,675 (4.5%) of whom had CDI. Mean age was 45 years and 52% were female. The in-hospital mortality rate was 0.5% (3% in the CDI subgroup).

25183,Inflammatory prostaglandin E2 signaling in a mouse model of Alzheimer disease.,OBJECTIVE: There is significant evidence for a central role of inflammation in the development of Alzheimer disease (AD). Epidemiological studies indicate that chronic use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) reduces the risk of developing AD in healthy aging populations. As NSAIDs inhibit the enzymatic activity of the inflammatory cyclooxygenases COX-1 and COX-2  these findings suggest that downstream prostaglandin signaling pathways function in the preclinical development of AD. Here  we investigate the function of prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2) ) signaling through its EP3 receptor in the neuroinflammatory response to AEEE peptide. METHODS: The function of PGE(2) signaling through its EP3 receptor was examined in vivo in a model of subacute neuroinflammation induced by administration of AEEE(42) peptides. Our findings were then confirmed in young adult APPSwe-PS1EEEE9 transgenic mice. RESULTS: Deletion of the PGE(2) EP3 receptor in a model of AEEE(42) peptide-induced neuroinflammation reduced proinflammatory gene expression  cytokine production  and oxidative stress. In the APPSwe-PS1EEEE9 model of familial AD  deletion of the EP3 receptor blocked induction of proinflammatory gene and protein expression and lipid peroxidation. In addition  levels of AEEE peptides were significantly decreased  as were EEE-secretase and EEE C-terminal fragment levels  suggesting that generation of AEEE peptides may be increased as,0,Inflammatory prostaglandin E2 signaling in a mouse model of Alzheimer disease.OBJECTIVE: There is significant evidence for a central role of inflammation in the development of Alzheimer disease (AD).

43384,Evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies using of a CPE-based Colorimetric live virus micro-neutralization assay in human serum samples,"The micro-neutralization assay is a fundamental test in virology, immunology, vaccine assessment and epidemiology studies. Since the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak at the end of December 2019 in China, it has become extremely important to have well-established and validated diagnostic and serological assays for this new emerging virus. Here, we present a micro-neutralization assay with the use of SARS-CoV-2 wild type virus with two different methods of read-out. We evaluated the performance of this assay using human serum samples taken from an italian seroepidemiological study being performed at the University of Siena, along with the human monoclonal antibody CR3022 and some iper-immune animal serum samples against Influenza and Adenovirus strains. The same panel of human samples have been previously tested in ELISA as a pre-screening. Positive, borderline and negative ELISA samples were evaluated in neutralization assay using two different method of read-out: subjective (by means of an inverted optical microscope) and objective (by means of a spectrophotometer). Our findings suggest that at least 50% of positive ELISA samples are positive in neutralization as well, and that method is able to quantify different antibody concentrations in a specific manner. Taken together, our results confirm that the colorimetric cytopathic effect-based microneutralization assay could be used as a valid clinical test method for epidemiological and vaccines studies.

11958,COVID-19 is Associated with an Unusual Pattern of Brain Microbleeds in Critically Ill Patients,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Covid-19, initially described as a respiratory system's infection, is currently more and more recognized as a multiorganic disease, including neurological manifestations. There is growing evidence about a potential neuroinvasive role of SARS-CoV-2. The purpose of this study is to describe new findings, in the form of cerebral microbleeds affecting different brain structures, observed in MRIs of critically ill patients. METHOD(S): For this purpose, the MR images of 9 patients with a common pattern of abnormal findings (2 women/7 men; 55-79 years of age; mean age: 67.7 years) were depicted. All patients were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and presented with delayed recovery of consciousness or important agitation, requiring brain MRI. RESULT(S): All patients had suffered from severe (5/9) or moderate (4/9) acute respiratory distress syndrome, requiring prolonged stay in the intensive care unit. Their common MRI finding was the presence of microbleeds in unusual distribution with a specific predilection for the corpus callosum. Other uncommon locations of microbleeds were the internal capsule (5/9), as well as middle cerebellar peduncles (5/9). Subcortical regions were also affected in the majority of patients. CONCLUSION(S): Brain MRI raised evidence that Covid-19 or its related treatment may involve the brain with an unusual pattern of microbleeds, predominantly affecting the corpus callosum. The mechanism of this finding is still unclear but the differential diagnosis should include thrombotic microangiopathy related to direct or indirect-through the cytokine cascade-damage by the SARS-CoV-2 on the endothelium of brain's vessels, as well as mechanisms similar to the hypoxemia brain-blood-barrier injury.Copyright ÁE© 2020 American Society of Neuroimaging",0,"COVID-19 is Associated with an Unusual Pattern of Brain Microbleeds in Critically Ill PatientsBACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Covid-19, initially described as a respiratory system's infection, is currently more and more recognized as a multiorganic disease, including neurological manifestations.

19547,Phase II study of thalidomide and radiation in children with newly diagnosed brain stem gliomas and glioblastoma multiforme,A phase II study was conducted to assess the efficacy of administering daily thalidomide concomitantly with radiation and continuing for up to 1 year following radiation in children with brain stem gliomas (BSG) or glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Secondary objectives were to obtain preliminary evidence of biologic activity of thalidomide and to evaluate toxicities from chronic administration of thalidomide in this population. Thirteen patients (2-14 years old) with newly diagnosed BSG (12 patients) or GBM (one patient) were enrolled between July 1999 and June 2000. All patients received focal radiotherapy to a total dose of 5 580 cGy. Thalidomide was administered once daily beginning on the first day of radiation and continued for 12 months or until the patient came off study. The starting dose was 12 mg/kg (rounded down to the nearest 50 mg) and was increased by 20% weekly  if tolerated  to 24 mg/kg or 1 000 mg (whichever was lower). Advanced imaging techniques and urine and serum analysis for anti-angiogenic markers were performed in some patients in an attempt to correlate changes with clinical effect of therapy. No patients completed the planned 12 months of thalidomide therapy and all have since died of disease progression. The median duration of therapy was 5 months (range 2-11 months). Nine patients came off study for progressive disease (PD)  three patients due to toxicity and one patient withdrew consent. Several patients on this study required more extended courses of high dose steroids than would have been otherwise expected for this population due to significant peritumoral edema and necrosis. No consistent pattern emerged from the biologic correlative studies from 11 patients. However  advanced imaging with techniques such as MR spectroscopy  MR perfusion and 18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) were helpful in distinguishing growing tumor from treatment effect and necrosis in some patients. The median time to progression (TTP) was 5 months (range 2-11 months) and the median time to death (TTD) was 9 months (range 5-17 months). In this small patient sample adding thalidomide to radiation did not improve TTP or TTD from historical controls  however  toxicity appeared to be increased.

The diagnoses were additionally supported by neuroimaging techniques for AD and PD. In ALS  the levels of Mg (p<0.01 significant difference)  Fe  Cu (p<0.05)  and Zn (p<0.10) in CSF were higher than those in controls. Some patients showed very high levels of Cu and Zn before the critical deterioration of the disease.

22694,Patient Satisfaction With Telemedicine During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Retrospective Cohort Study,"BACKGROUND: New York City was the international epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic. Healthcare providers responded by rapidly transitioning from in-person to video visits. Telemedicine (i.e. video visits) is a potentially disruptive innovation; however, little is known about patient satisfaction with this emerging alternative to the traditional clinical encounter. OBJECTIVE: To determine if patient satisfaction differs between video vs. in-person visits. METHODS: Retrospective observational cohort study in which we analyzed 38,609 Press Ganey patient satisfaction survey outcomes from clinic encounters (620 video visits vs. 37,989 in-person visits) at a single-institution urban, quaternary academic medical center in New York City for patients aged 18 years during April 1, 2019 to March 31, 2020. Time was categorized as pre-COVID-19 vs. COVID-19 (before vs. after March 4, 2020). Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney tests and multivariable linear regression were used for hypothesis testing and statistical modeling, respectively. RESULTS: We experienced an 8,729% increase in video visit utilization during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the same period last year. Video visit Press Ganey scores were significantly higher than in-person visits (94.9% vs. 92.5%; P<0.001). In adjusted analysis, video visits (Parameter Estimate [PE] 2.18; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.20, 3.16) and the COVID-19 period (PE 0.55; 95%CI 0.04, 1.06) were associated with higher patient satisfaction. Younger age (PE -2.05; 95%CI -2.66, -1.22), female gender (PE -0.73; 95%CI -0.96, -0.50), and new visit type (PE -0.75; 95%CI -1.00, -0.49) were associated with lower patient satisfaction, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Patient satisfaction with video visits is high and is not a barrier towards a paradigm shift away from traditional in-person clinic visits. Future research to compare other clinic visit quality indicators is needed to guide and implement widespread adoption of telemedicine.

To investigate these issues  [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) was performed in 11 nondemented PD patients with advanced disease and 10 age-matched controls. PD patients were studied after withdrawal of all dopaminergic medication to produce a practically defined off condition  and a second time 1 hour after levodopa  resulting in a clinical on state. Dynamic PET scans and simultaneous arterialised venous blood samples of [(18)F] activity were obtained. A graphical approach was used to generate parametric images of rCMRGlc and statistical parametric mapping to localise significant metabolic changes in PD. Compared with controls  global rCMRGlc was reduced in the on but not in the off condition in PD. In both states  significant regional reductions of glucose uptake were found in the parietal  frontal  temporal cortex  and caudate nucleus. Reductions correlated with the severity of disability in frontal and temporal cortex. Direct comparison between on and off conditions revealed relatively greater reductions of uptake in the ventral/orbital frontal cortex and the thalamus during on. Results suggest that cortical and caudate hypometabolism are common in advanced PD and that caution is mandatory if [(18)F]FDG PET is being used to differentiate advanced PD from dementia and progressive supranuclear palsy where similar reductions are seen. Furthermore  in PD  administration of levodopa is associated with further hypometabolism in orbitofrontal cortex; an area known to be relevant for reversal learning where performance is typically impaired after dopaminergic treatment.,0,Resting regional cerebral glucose metabolism in advanced Parkinson's disease studied in the off and on conditions with [(18)F]FDG-PET.Studies of resting regional cerebral glucose consumption (rCMRGlc) in nondemented patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) have produced conflicting results  reporting both reduced and normal metabolism in advanced disease and reduced or normal metabolism after dopaminergic therapy.

11731,Hippocampal volume in geriatric depression.,BACKGROUND: There is a growing literature on the importance of hippocampal volume in geriatric depression. METHODS: We examined hippocampal volume in a group of elderly depressed patients and a group of elderly control subjects (N = 66 geriatric depressed patients and 18 elderly nondepressed control subjects) recruited through Duke's Mental Health Clinical Research Center for the Study of Depression in the Elderly. The subjects received a standardized evaluation  including a magnetic resonance imaging scan of the brain. Patients had unipolar major depression and were free of comorbid major psychiatric illness and neurologic illness. Differences were assessed using t tests and linear regression modeling. RESULTS: Accounting for the effects of age  gender  and total brain volume  depressed patients tended to have smaller right hippocampal volume (p =.014) and left hippocampal volume (p =.073). Among depressed patients  age of onset was negatively but not significantly related to right hippocampal volume (p =.052) and to left hippocampal volume (p =.062). We noted that among subjects with either right or left hippocampal volume of 3 mL or less  the vast majority were patients rather than control subjects. CONCLUSIONS: These results support a role for hippocampal dysfunction in depression  particularly in late-age onset depression. Longitudinal studies examining both depressive and cognitive outcomes are needed to clarify the relationships between the hippocampus  depression  and dementia.,0,Hippocampal volume in geriatric depression.BACKGROUND: There is a growing literature on the importance of hippocampal volume in geriatric depression.

All 40 patients also had a CT or MRI scan  and a histological diagnosis was available for 27 of the patients. For each patient  the ratio of counts in the lesion region of interest (ROI) to counts in the contralateral ROI was calculated and found to be between 0.58 and 9.60. The ratios for high-grade gliomas  metastases and meningiomas were high (> 2.7)  especially in tumours with good vascularization.

METHODS: A prospective online survey was sent out to 4234 surgeons of the AGA - Society of Arthroscopy and Joint-Surgery (Gesellschaft fur Arthroskopie und Gelenkchirurgie, AGA). The survey was created using SurveyMonkey software and consisted of 23 questions relating to the reduction of orthopaedic services at the participating centres and the impact that the pandemic is having on each surgeon. RESULTS: A total of 890 orthopaedic surgeons responded to the online survey. Approximately 90% of them experienced a reduction in their surgical caseload and patient contact. 38.7% stated that their institutions returned to providing diagnostic arthroscopies. 54.5% reported that they went back to performing anterior cruciate ligament reconstructions (ACLR), 62.6% were performing arthroscopic meniscus procedures, and 55.8% had resumed performing shoulder arthroscopy. Only 31.9% of the surgeons were able to perform elective total joint arthroplasty. 60% of the participants stated that they had suffered substantial financial loss due to the pandemic. CONCLUSION: A gradual resumption of orthopaedic health-care services was observed in May 2020. Typical orthopaedic surgical procedures like ACLR, shoulder arthroscopy and elective total joint arthroplasty were reported to be currently performed by 54%, 56% and 32% of surgeons, respectively.

Some behavioural observations suggest a common source of impaired naming across these patient groups  while others find partially unique patterns of naming difficulty. We hypothesized that a large-scale neural network underlies naming  and that patterns of impaired naming in AD  FTD and CBD reflect cortical atrophy that interrupts this network in a manner that is partially shared and partially unique across these patient groups. We tested this hypothesis by correlating naming impairments with voxel-based morphometric (VBM) analyses of cortical atrophy in structural MRIs of 50 patients. We found significant naming deficits in all patient groups. Naming also correlated with lexical retrieval in all patient groups  including subgroups of patients with FTD. VBM analyses showed significant cortical atrophy  which was shared across AD  FTD and CBD patients in the left lateral temporal cortex; this area correlated with naming accuracy in all groups. Left lateral temporal atrophy thus appears to interfere with a lexical retrieval component of naming in AD  FTD and CBD. Impaired naming also correlated with semantic memory and visual perceptual-spatial functioning in specific groups of patients and  correspondingly  naming correlated with cortical atrophy in partially distinct neuroanatomical distributions in AD  FTD  CBD and subgroups of patients with FTD.

53922,Influence of the Covid-19 pandemic on out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. A Spanish nationwide prospective cohort study,"AIMS: The influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on attendance to out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) has only been described in city or regional settings. The impact of COVID-19 across an entire country with a high infection rate is yet to be explored. METHODS: The study uses data from 8629 cases recorded in two time-series (2017/2018 and 2020) of the Spanish national registry. Data from a non-COVID-19 period and the COVID-19 period (February 1st to April 30th 2020) were compared. During the COVID-19 period, data a further analysis comparing non-pandemic and pandemic weeks (defined according to the WHO declaration on March 11th, 2020) was conducted. The chi-squared analysis examined differences in OHCA attendance and other patient and resuscitation characteristics. Multivariate logistic regression examined survival likelihood to hospital admission and discharge. The multilevel analysis examined the differential effects of regional COVID-19 incidence on these same outcomes. RESULTS: During the COVID-19 period, the incidence of resuscitation attempts declined and survival to hospital admission (OR = 1.72; 95%CI = 1.46-2.04; p < 0.001) and discharge (OR = 1.38; 95%CI = 1.07-1.78; p = 0.013) fell compared to the non-COVID period. This pattern was also observed when comparing non-pandemic weeks and pandemic weeks. COVID-19 incidence impinged significantly upon outcomes regardless of regional variation, with low, medium, and high incidence regions equally affected. CONCLUSIONS: The pandemic, irrespective of its incidence, seems to have particularly impeded the pre-hospital phase of OHCA care.

A Spanish nationwide prospective cohort studyAIMS: The influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on attendance to out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) has only been described in city or regional settings. The impact of COVID-19 across an entire country with a high infection rate is yet to be explored. METHODS: The study uses data from 8629 cases recorded in two time-series (2017/2018 and 2020) of the Spanish national registry. Data from a non-COVID-19 period and the COVID-19 period (February 1st to April 30th 2020) were compared. During the COVID-19 period, data a further analysis comparing non-pandemic and pandemic weeks (defined according to the WHO declaration on March 11th, 2020) was conducted. The chi-squared analysis examined differences in OHCA attendance and other patient and resuscitation characteristics. Multivariate logistic regression examined survival likelihood to hospital admission and discharge. The multilevel analysis examined the differential effects of regional COVID-19 incidence on these same outcomes. RESULTS: During the COVID-19 period, the incidence of resuscitation attempts declined and survival to hospital admission (OR = 1.72; 95%CI = 1.46-2.04; p < 0.001) and discharge (OR = 1.38; 95%CI = 1.07-1.78; p = 0.013) fell compared to the non-COVID period. This pattern was also observed when comparing non-pandemic weeks and pandemic weeks. COVID-19 incidence impinged significantly upon outcomes regardless of regional variation, with low, medium, and high incidence regions equally affected. CONCLUSIONS: The pandemic, irrespective of its incidence, seems to have particularly impeded the pre-hospital phase of OHCA care. Present findings call for the need to adapt out-of-hospital care for periods of serious infection risk. STUDY REGISTRATION NUMBER: ISRCTN10437835. Copyright ÁE© 2020.

61234,Thirty-day mortality following surgical management of hip fractures during the COVID-19 pandemic: findings from a prospective multi-centre UK study,"PURPOSE: Thirty-day mortality of patients with hip fracture is well researched and predictive; validated scoring tools have been developed (Nottingham Hip Fracture Score, NHFS). COVID-19 has significantly greater mortality in the elderly and comorbid patients which includes hip fracture patients. Non-operative treatment is not appropriate due to significantly higher mortality, and therefore, these patients are often exposed to COVID-19 in the peri-operative period. What is unclear is the effect of concomitant COVID-19 infection in these patients. METHODS: A multicentre prospective study across ten sites in the United Kingdom (responsible for 7% of hip fracture patients per annum in the UK). Demographic and background information were collected by independent chart review. Data on surgical factors included American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score, time to theatre, Nottingham Hip fracture score (NHFS) and classification of fracture were also collected between 1st March 2020 and 30th April 2020 with a matched cohort from the same period in 2019.

2514,"Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease surveillance in Argentina, 1997-2008.",BACKGROUND: Epidemiological data on Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) from Latin America are limited. We present a comprehensive epidemiological survey on CJD patients in Argentina based on systematic surveillance between 1997 and 2008. METHODS: A CJD Surveillance Referral Center (SRC) was established in Argentina in 1997; previously a Neuropathology Referral Center was used from 1983 to 1996. All suspected cases referred to the SRC were classified using established criteria on the basis of information derived from the following: clinical data form  EEG  MRI (both for central review)  cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for protein 14-3-3 Western blot (WB)  autopsy or biopsy material for neuropathology  prion protein (PrP) immunohistochemistry and PrP WB  as well as blood for DNA studies (when brain tissue was not available). RESULTS: Of the 517 patients referred to the SRC between 1997 and 2008  211 (40.8%) had CJD or other transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) (definite or probable). Possible cases totaled 14.5%  while cases with no WHO criteria accounted for 16.4%. Non-CJD cases excluded by biopsy/autopsy or during follow-up corresponded to 28.2% of the 517 referrals. Main differential diagnoses included neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease  frontotemporal dementia  vascular  metabolic or viral encephalopathy  and Hashimoto's disease. Five percent of referred patients ultimately recovered. Eighty-three percent of TSE cases were sporadic CJD; 17% were genetic  mainly E200K (15.6%); the remaining 1.4% included an octarepeat insertion and two Gerstmann-Str~}dussler-Scheinker cases (P102L). Seventy-four of 100 definite cases had frozen tissue available for molecular subtyping (PrP(Sc)/codon 129). CSF protein 14-3-3 WB sensitivity was 72.3% and specificity was 92.1%. Clinical diagnostic criteria for probable CJD when compared to definite diagnosis by neuropathology showed 71.3% sensitivity  86.2% specificity  94.4% positive predictive value and 48% negative predictive value. Country incidence increased over time and reached 0.85 cases per million in 2008  with the highest rate detected in the city of Buenos Aires (1.8).

However  if Abeta42 was not degraded in their cytoplasm  then Abeta42-expressing cells underwent apoptosis. The number of Abeta42-expressing cells is significantly increased by the inhibition of proteasome with MG132.

45312,The impact of COVID-19 on smoking patterns in Pakistan: findings from a longitudinal survey of smokers,"INTRODUCTION: We investigated the influence of COVID-19 on smoking patterns in Pakistan. METHODS: In a longitudinal survey, we asked cigarette smokers in Pakistan about their smoking behaviours before and since COVID-19. Smokers were recruited before COVID-19 using two-stage random probability sampling. Since COVID-19, three subsequent waves were conducted over the telephone, asking additional questions on social determinants, mental health and wellbeing. Based on the first two waves, we estimated the proportion of smokers who stopped, decreased, maintained, or increased smoking. We also explored any factors associated with the change in smoking patterns. In those who stopped smoking soon after COVID-19, we estimated the proportion relapsed in subsequent waves. We estimated all proportions based on complete-case analysis. RESULTS: We recruited 6,014 smokers between September 2019 and February 2020; of these, 2,087 (2,062 reported smoking outcomes) were followed up in May 2020 after COVID-19. Since COVID-19, 14% (290/2,062) smokers reported quitting. Among those who continued smoking: 68% (1210/1772) reduced, 14% (239/1772) maintained, and 18% (323/1772) increased cigarette consumption; 37% (351/938) reported at least one quit attempt; 41% (669/1619) were more motivated while 21% (333/1619) were less motivated to quit. Changes in smoking patterns varied with nicotine dependence, motivation to quit, and financial stability since COVID-19. Among those reporting quitting soon after COVID-19, 39% (81/206) relapsed in the subsequent months (June-July 2020). CONCLUSIONS: There have been significant bidirectional changes in smoking patterns since COVID-19 in Pakistan. While many people stopped, reduced, or tried quitting smoking, some increased smoking, and some relapsed after quitting. IMPLICATIONS: We observed significant and complex changes in people's smoking patterns, which are likely to be attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic and replicated in similar events in the future. Assessing these changes are essential for most low- and middle-income countries like Pakistan, where the vast majority of tobacco users live, but cessation support is still rudimentary.

METHODS: In a longitudinal survey, we asked cigarette smokers in Pakistan about their smoking behaviours before and since COVID-19. Smokers were recruited before COVID-19 using two-stage random probability sampling. Since COVID-19, three subsequent waves were conducted over the telephone, asking additional questions on social determinants, mental health and wellbeing. Based on the first two waves, we estimated the proportion of smokers who stopped, decreased, maintained, or increased smoking. We also explored any factors associated with the change in smoking patterns. In those who stopped smoking soon after COVID-19, we estimated the proportion relapsed in subsequent waves. We estimated all proportions based on complete-case analysis. RESULTS: We recruited 6,014 smokers between September 2019 and February 2020; of these, 2,087 (2,062 reported smoking outcomes) were followed up in May 2020 after COVID-19. Since COVID-19, 14% (290/2,062) smokers reported quitting. Among those who continued smoking: 68% (1210/1772) reduced, 14% (239/1772) maintained, and 18% (323/1772) increased cigarette consumption; 37% (351/938) reported at least one quit attempt; 41% (669/1619) were more motivated while 21% (333/1619) were less motivated to quit. Changes in smoking patterns varied with nicotine dependence, motivation to quit, and financial stability since COVID-19. Among those reporting quitting soon after COVID-19, 39% (81/206) relapsed in the subsequent months (June-July 2020). CONCLUSIONS: There have been significant bidirectional changes in smoking patterns since COVID-19 in Pakistan. While many people stopped, reduced, or tried quitting smoking, some increased smoking, and some relapsed after quitting. IMPLICATIONS: We observed significant and complex changes in people's smoking patterns, which are likely to be attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic and replicated in similar events in the future. Assessing these changes are essential for most low- and middle-income countries like Pakistan, where the vast majority of tobacco users live, but cessation support is still rudimentary. If provided routinely, smoking cessation interventions can potentially support millions of highly motivated individuals in quitting successfully both in general as well as in global events like COVID-19, in particular.

48200,Prediction models for diagnosis and prognosis of covid-19 infection: systematic review and critical appraisal,"OBJECTIVE: To review and critically appraise published and preprint reports of prediction models for diagnosing coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) in patients with suspected infection, for prognosis of patients with covid-19, and for detecting people in the general population at risk of being admitted to hospital for covid-19 pneumonia. DESIGN: Rapid systematic review and critical appraisal. DATA SOURCES: PubMed and Embase through Ovid, Arxiv, medRxiv, and bioRxiv up to 24 March 2020. STUDY SELECTION: Studies that developed or validated a multivariable covid-19 related prediction model. DATA EXTRACTION: At least two authors independently extracted data using the CHARMS (critical appraisal and data extraction for systematic reviews of prediction modelling studies) checklist; risk of bias was assessed using PROBAST (prediction model risk of bias assessment tool). RESULTS: 2696 titles were screened, and 27 studies describing 31 prediction models were included. Three models were identified for predicting hospital admission from pneumonia and other events (as proxy outcomes for covid-19 pneumonia) in the general population; 18 diagnostic models for detecting covid-19 infection (13 were machine learning based on computed tomography scans); and 10 prognostic models for predicting mortality risk, progression to severe disease, or length of hospital stay. Only one study used patient data from outside of China. The most reported predictors of presence of covid-19 in patients with suspected disease included age, body temperature, and signs and symptoms. The most reported predictors of severe prognosis in patients with covid-19 included age, sex, features derived from computed tomography scans, C reactive protein, lactic dehydrogenase, and lymphocyte count. C index estimates ranged from 0.73 to 0.81 in prediction models for the general population (reported for all three models), from 0.81 to more than 0.99 in diagnostic models (reported for 13 of the 18 models), and from 0.85 to 0.98 in prognostic models (reported for six of the 10 models). All studies were rated at high risk of bias, mostly because of non-representative selection of control patients, exclusion of patients who had not experienced the event of interest by the end of the study, and high risk of model overfitting. Reporting quality varied substantially between studies. Most reports did not include a description of the study population or intended use of the models, and calibration of predictions was rarely assessed. CONCLUSION: Prediction models for covid-19 are quickly entering the academic literature to support medical decision making at a time when they are urgently needed. This review indicates that proposed models are poorly reported, at high risk of bias, and their reported performance is probably optimistic. Immediate sharing of well documented individual participant data from covid-19 studies is needed for collaborative efforts to develop more rigorous prediction models and validate existing ones. The predictors identified in included studies could be considered as candidate predictors for new models. Methodological guidance should be followed because unreliable predictions could cause more harm than benefit in guiding clinical decisions. Finally, studies should adhere to the TRIPOD (transparent reporting of a multivariable prediction model for individual prognosis or diagnosis) reporting guideline.

39672,The chromosome 21 transcription factor ETS2 transactivates the beta-APP promoter: implications for Down syndrome.,The gene that codes for beta-amyloid precursor protein (beta-APP)  a protein centrally involved in senile plaque formation in Down syndrome (DS) and Alzheimer's disease (AD)  is located on chromosome 21. In DS beta-APP expression is three- to fourfold higher than what is expected from the 1.5-fold increased gene load  suggesting that other genes on chromosome 21 directly or indirectly can further up-regulate beta-APP. Here we show that the chromosome 21 transcription factor ETS2 transactivates the beta-APP gene via specific Ets binding sites in the beta-APP promoter and  in this respect  cooperates with the transcription factor complex AP1. We further show that brains and primary neuronal cultures from Ets2 transgenic mice  as well as 3T3 fibroblasts that overexpress ETS2  display molecular abnormalities also seen in DS  such as elevated expression of beta-APP protein  an increase in presenilin-1 and increased beta-amyloid production. We conclude that ETS2 is a transcriptional regulator of beta-APP and that overexpression of ETS2 in DS may play a role in the pathogenesis of the brain abnormalities in DS and possibly AD.,0,The chromosome 21 transcription factor ETS2 transactivates the beta-APP promoter: implications for Down syndrome.The gene that codes for beta-amyloid precursor protein (beta-APP)  a protein centrally involved in senile plaque formation in Down syndrome (DS) and Alzheimer's disease (AD)  is located on chromosome 21.

51336,Applications of digital holographic microscopy in therapeutic evaluation of Chinese herbal medicines.,Therapeutic use of Chinese herbal medicines (CHMs) is a new approach to treat neurodegenerative diseases  such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. The detection of soma volume and neurite outgrowth of living neurons is a highly relevant biomarker related to various application fields  including therapy efficacy and drug safety evaluation. Through the use of digital holographic microscopy (DHM)  we may evaluate the therapeutic effect of CHMs in curing neurodegeneration. Panax ginseng has been used in traditional Chinese herbal medicine for centuries. In this study  DHM is applied to monitor the three-dimensional morphology change of retinoic acid-induced human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells during Panax ginseng treatment. We demonstrate the capability of DHM to detect noninvasively SH-SY5Y cell apoptosis and rescue through the measurement of neuronal volume and neurite outgrowth regulation without any labeling reagent. Through DHM  we observed the phase images of the rapidly shrinking cells with decreasing soma volume and shortening neurite outgrowth during glutamate treatments. Then shrinkage in glutamate-induced cells is significantly alleviated during Panax ginseng treatment. The results through DHM are consistent with the result from MTT assay for assessing cell viability during Panax ginseng treatment. Thus  we suggest that application of DHM for measuring soma volume and neurite outgrowth of living neurons may be one appropriate therapeutic evaluation for CHMs.,0,Applications of digital holographic microscopy in therapeutic evaluation of Chinese herbal medicines.Therapeutic use of Chinese herbal medicines (CHMs) is a new approach to treat neurodegenerative diseases  such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease.

METHODS: The subjects were 48 elderly people who consulted a memory disorder clinic. The visual event-related potential was measured using oddball tasks. Brain waves were recorded from four sites. We analyzed the P300 amplitude and latency. Subjects were divided into three groups (the dementia with Alzheimer's disease group [ADG]; the intermediate group [MG]  and the healthy group [HG]) based on the Revised Hasegawa Dementia Scale  Mini-mental State Examination scores and the Clinical Dementia Rating. RESULTS: For all subjects  there was a significant positive correlation between P300 latency and Z-score of voxel-based specific regional analysis for Alzheimer's disease for crying or smiling faces. There was a negative correlation between P300 amplitude and Z-score for the crying face. MG subjects were divided into two groups (high risk: HRMG  low risk: LRMG) based on Z-scores (HRMGEEEEEE2.0). The P300 amplitude of ADG was significantly smaller than that of HG  and the P300 latency of ADG was significantly longer than those of other groups for crying or smiling faces. The P300 latency of HRMG was significantly longer than that of LRMG for the smiling face. Furthermore  the P300 latency for the crying face was significantly shorter than that for the smiling face in HG and ADG.

12981,Health system resilience in managing the COVID-19 pandemic: lessons from Singapore,"Singapore, one of the first countries affected by COVID-19, adopted a national strategy for the pandemic which emphasised preparedness through a whole-of-nation approach. The pandemic was well contained initially until early April 2020, when there was a surge in cases, attributed to Singapore residents returning from hotspots overseas, and more significantly, rapid transmission locally within migrant worker dormitories. In this paper, we present the response of Singapore to the COVID-19 pandemic based on core dimensions of health system resilience during outbreaks. We also discussed on the surge in cases in April 2020, highlighting efforts to mitigate it. There was: (1) clear leadership and governance which adopted flexible plans appropriate to the situation; (2) timely, accurate and transparent communication from the government; (3) public health measures to reduce imported cases, and detect as well as isolate cases early; (4) maintenance of health service delivery; (5) access to crisis financing; and (6) legal foundation to complement policy measures. Areas for improvement include understanding reasons for poor uptake of government initiatives, such as the mobile application for contact tracing and adopting a more inclusive response that protects all individuals, including at-risk populations.

We discuss extended interval dosing as a risk-reduction strategy for multiple sclerosis patients on natalizumab, and the use of interleukin-6 inhibitors in such patients who contract COVID-19.Copyright ÁE© The Author(s) 2020.","{'judgement': 'False', 'index': 762}",0,"{'judgement': 'False', 'index': 762}",0,"{'judgement': 'False', 'index': 762}",0,"{'judgement': 'False', 'index': 762}",0,"{'judgement': 'False', 'index': 762}",0
63018,Multimodal analysis of functional and structural disconnection in Alzheimer's disease using multiple kernel SVM.,Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients exhibit alterations in the functional connectivity between spatially segregated brain regions which may be related to both local gray matter (GM) atrophy as well as a decline in the fiber integrity of the underlying white matter tracts. Machine learning algorithms are able to automatically detect the patterns of the disease in image data  and therefore  constitute a suitable basis for automated image diagnostic systems. The question of which magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) modalities are most useful in a clinical context is as yet unresolved. We examined multimodal MRI data acquired from 28 subjects with clinically probable AD and 25 healthy controls. Specifically  we used fiber tract integrity as measured by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)  GM volume derived from structural MRI  and the graph-theoretical measures 'local clustering coefficient' and 'shortest path length' derived from resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) to evaluate the utility of the three imaging methods in automated multimodal image diagnostics  to assess their individual performance  and the level of concordance between them. We ran the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm and validated the results using leave-one-out cross-validation. For the single imaging modalities  we obtained an area under the curve (AUC) of 80% for rs-fMRI  87% for DTI  and 86% for GM volume. When it came to the multimodal SVM  we obtained an AUC of 82% using all three modalities  and 89% using only DTI measures and GM volume.

61734,Prevalence and Psychosocial Correlates of Mental Health Outcomes Among Chinese College Students During the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Pandemic,"Objectives: To investigate the prevalence and risk factors for poor mental health of Chinese university students during the Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Method: Chinese nation-wide on-line cross-sectional survey on university students, collected between February 12th and 17th, 2020. Primary outcome was prevalence of clinically-relevant posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms. Secondary outcomes on poor mental health included prevalence of clinically-relevant anxiety and depressive symptoms, while posttraumatic growth was considered as indicator of effective coping reaction. Results: Of 2,500 invited Chinese university students, 2,038 completed the survey. Prevalence of clinically-relevant PTSD, anxiety, and depressive symptoms, and post traumatic growth (PTG) was 30.8, 15.5, 23.3, and 66.9% respectively. Older age, knowing people who had been isolated, more ACEs, higher level of anxious attachment, and lower level of resilience all predicted primary outcome (all p < 0.01). Conclusions: A significant proportion of young adults exhibit clinically relevant posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxious or depressive symptoms, but a larger portion of individuals showed to effectively cope with COVID-19 pandemic. Interventions promoting resilience should be provided, even remotely, to those subjects with specific risk factors to develop poor mental health during COVID-19 or other pandemics with social isolation.

DESIGN: Studies were included in the meta-analysis if they had cohort, case-control or case series designs and provided sufficient details on clinical symptoms, laboratory outcomes and asymptomatic patients. SETTING: PubMed, Embase, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, Wanfang, China Science and Technology Journal Database and China National Knowledge Infrastructure databases were electronically searched to identify related studies published between 1 January 2020 and 16 March 2020. Three reviewers independently examined the literature, extracted relevant data and assessed the risk of publication bias before including the studies in the meta-analysis. PARTICIPANTS: The confirmed cases of COVID-19. RESULTS: A total of 55 unique retrospective studies involving 8697 patients with COVID-19 were identified. Meta-analysis showed that a higher proportion of infected patients were male (53.3%), and the two major symptoms observed were fever (78.4%) and cough (58.3%). Other common symptoms included fatigue (34%), myalgia (21.9%), expectoration (23.7%), anorexia (22.9%), chest tightness (22.9%) and dyspnoea (20.6%). Minor symptoms included nausea and vomiting (6.6%), diarrhoea (8.2%), headache (11.3%), pharyngalgia (11.6%), shivering (15.2%) and rhinorrhea (7.3%). About 5.4% of the patients were asymptomatic. Most patients showed normal leucocyte counts (64.7%) and elevated C reactive protein levels (65.9%). Lymphopaenia was observed in about 47.6% of the infected patients, along with abnormal levels of myocardial enzymes (49.4%) and liver function (26.4%). Other findings included leucopenia (23.5%), elevated D-dimer (20.4%), elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (20.4%), leucocytosis (9.9%), elevated procalcitonin (16.7%) and abnormal renal function (10.9%). CONCLUSIONS: The most commonly experienced symptoms of patients with COVID-19 were fever and cough. Myalgia, anorexia, chest tightness and dyspnoea were found in some patients. A relatively small percentage of patients were asymptomatic and could act as carriers of the disease. Most patients showed normal leucocyte counts, elevated levels of C reactive protein and lymphopaenia, confirming the viral origin of the disease. Copyright ÁE© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical utility of GAI-memory discrepancy scores to identify memory impairment in 34 patients with Alzheimer's type dementia (DAT) versus a sample of 34 demographically matched healthy participants. On average  patients with DAT obtained significantly lower scores on all WAIS-III and WMS-III indexes and had larger GAI-memory discrepancy scores. Clinical outcome analyses revealed that GAI-memory scores were useful at identifying memory impairment in patients with DAT versus matched healthy participants. However  GAI-memory discrepancy scores failed to provide unique interpretive information beyond that which is gained from the memory indexes alone.

32542,Missense mutations in the progranulin gene linked to frontotemporal lobar degeneration with ubiquitin-immunoreactive inclusions reduce progranulin production and secretion.,Loss of function mutations in progranulin cause tau-negative frontotemporal lobar degeneration with ubiquitin-positive inclusions. A major protein component of these inclusions is TDP-43  which becomes hyperphosphorylated  ubiquitinated  and cleaved to generate C-terminal fragments  which apparently translocate from nuclei to the cytoplasm. Most progranulin mutations are nonsense mutations resulting in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay and consequently reduced progranulin protein levels. However  some missense mutations are described that occur within the signal sequence and mature progranulin. We now demonstrate that a progranulin mutation located within the signal sequence (PGRN A9D) results in cytoplasmic missorting with extremely low expression. In contrast  two other progranulin mutations (PGRN P248L and R432C) are expressed as immature proteins but are inefficiently transported through and partially degraded within the secretory pathway  resulting in a significantly reduced secretion. Thus apparently all progranulin mutations cause reduced protein expression or secretion  although by different cellular mechanisms. To investigate a putative relationship between reduced expression of progranulin and TDP-43 relocalization and deposition  we down-regulated progranulin in human cell lines and in zebrafish. Upon reduction of progranulin  neither a major redistribution of TDP-43 nor proteolytic processing to disease-characterizing C-terminal fragments could be observed.,0,Missense mutations in the progranulin gene linked to frontotemporal lobar degeneration with ubiquitin-immunoreactive inclusions reduce progranulin production and secretion.Loss of function mutations in progranulin cause tau-negative frontotemporal lobar degeneration with ubiquitin-positive inclusions.

59110,High prevalence of cerebral microbleeds at 7Tesla MRI in patients with early Alzheimer's disease.,The prevalence of microbleeds on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) is lower than that of its presumed pathological correlate  cerebral amyloid angiopathy. We examined 18 patients with early AD or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 18 non-demented controls with ultra-high field strength 7Tesla MRI  to assess if the actual prevalence of microbleeds could be higher than is currently reported. One or more microbleeds were visualized in 78% of the MCI/AD patients and in 44% of the controls (p = 0.04). 7Tesla MRI shows that presence of microbleeds may be the rule  rather than exception in patients with MCI/AD.,0,High prevalence of cerebral microbleeds at 7Tesla MRI in patients with early Alzheimer's disease.The prevalence of microbleeds on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) is lower than that of its presumed pathological correlate  cerebral amyloid angiopathy.

54760,"Assessing Knowledge, Attitudes and Practices of dental practitioners regarding the COVID-19 pandemic: A multinational study","BACKGROUND: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been declared a global public health emergency that is affecting people across the globe. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess the Knowledge, Attitudes and Practices (KAP) of dental practitioners regarding the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-2019) pandemic. MATERIAL AND METHODS: An online questionnaire was distributed among dentists across the globe using a combination of convenience and snowball sampling. The questionnaire was divided into 4 sections: the 1st one contained personal information, whereas the 2nd, 3rd and 4th sections assessed knowledge (11 questions), attitudes (6 questions) and practices (7 questions) of the dentists. The data was subjected to the Shapiro-Wilk test, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), multivariate linear regression, and Pearson's correlation; 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated and odds ratio (OR) was obtained. The analysis was done using IBM SPSS for Windows, v. 21.0. RESULTS: The total number of the responses received (860) was divided with regard to various continents (Asia, Americas - North and South, Europe, Africa, and other - Australia and Antarctica). The largest number of dentists came from the Asian continent (264; 30.7%). Most dentists had a degree of MDS (Master of Dental Science) (301; 35.0%), followed by BDS (Bachelor of Dental Surgery) (282; 32.8%) and DDS (Doctor of Dental Surgery) (226; 26.3%). High/Good knowledge and practice scores were observed among 92.7% and 79.5 % of the dentists, respectively. Good knowledge scores were significantly associated with qualifications (p = 0.04) and years of practice (p = 0.02); good practice scores were associated with qualifications only (p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: The dentists were found to have good knowledge and practice scores, which is important to combat COVID-19. They are advised to follow the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines in their clinics, and sensitize their staff so that no stone is left unturned in defeating this pandemic.",0,"Assessing Knowledge, Attitudes and Practices of dental practitioners regarding the COVID-19 pandemic: A multinational studyBACKGROUND: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been declared a global public health emergency that is affecting people across the globe.

32536,"Pyroglutamate Abeta pathology in APP/PS1KI mice, sporadic and familial Alzheimer's disease cases.",The presence of Abeta(pE3) (N-terminal truncated Abeta starting with pyroglutamate) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) has received considerable attention since the discovery that this peptide represents a dominant fraction of Abeta peptides in senile plaques of AD brains. This was later confirmed by other reports investigating AD and Down's syndrome postmortem brain tissue. Importantly  Abeta(pE3) has a higher aggregation propensity  and stability  and shows an increased toxicity compared to full-length Abeta. We have recently shown that intraneuronal accumulation of Abeta(pE3) peptides induces a severe neuron loss and an associated neurological phenotype in the TBA2 mouse model for AD. Given the increasing interest in Abeta(pE3)  we have generated two novel monoclonal antibodies which were characterized as highly specific for Abeta(pE3) peptides and herein used to analyze plaque deposition in APP/PS1KI mice  an AD model with severe neuron loss and learning deficits. This was compared with the plaque pattern present in brain tissue from sporadic and familial AD cases. Abundant plaques positive for Abeta(pE3) were present in patients with sporadic AD and familial AD including those carrying mutations in APP (arctic and Swedish) and PS1. Interestingly  in APP/PS1KI mice we observed a continuous increase in Abeta(pE3) plaque load with increasing age  while the density for Abeta(1-x ) plaques declined with aging. We therefore assume that  in particular  the peptides starting with position 1 of Abeta are N-truncated as disease progresses  and that  Abeta(pE3) positive plaques are resistant to age-dependent degradation likely due to their high stability and propensity to aggregate.,0,"Pyroglutamate Abeta pathology in APP/PS1KI mice, sporadic and familial Alzheimer's disease cases.The presence of Abeta(pE3) (N-terminal truncated Abeta starting with pyroglutamate) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) has received considerable attention since the discovery that this peptide represents a dominant fraction of Abeta peptides in senile plaques of AD brains.

7804,Revisiting brain reserve hypothesis in frontotemporal dementia: evidence from a brain perfusion study.,BACKGROUND: Literature data on Alzheimer's disease suggest that years of schooling and occupational level are associated with a reserve mechanism. No data on patients with behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) are available yet. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of education  occupation  and midlife leisure activities on brain reserve in bvFTD. METHODS: Fifty-four bvFTD patients entered the study and underwent neuropsychological and behavioral assessment  including the FTD-modified Clinical Dementia Rating for FTD (FTD-modified CDR)  and SPECT imaging. We tested for the linear correlation of educational and occupational level  and midlife leisure activities with regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF)  controlling for demographic variables (age and gender) and for cognitive performance (FTD-modified CDR) (statistical parametric mapping). RESULTS: A significant relationship between higher educational and occupational attainments and lower rCBF in medial frontal cortex and dorsolateral frontal cortex  bilaterally  was found (p < 0.005). When midlife leisure activities were considered  no correlation was found. The correlation between a reserve index  accounting for both educational and occupational level  and rCBF showed the same pattern of hypoperfusion. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that education and occupation act as proxies for reserve capacity in bvFTD. These lifestyle attainments may counteract the onset of this genetic-based disease in at-risk individuals.,0,Revisiting brain reserve hypothesis in frontotemporal dementia: evidence from a brain perfusion study.BACKGROUND: Literature data on Alzheimer's disease suggest that years of schooling and occupational level are associated with a reserve mechanism.

54455,Effects on splicing and protein function of three mutations in codon N296 of tau in vitro.,Three Mutations were recently reported in the same codon (N296) in exon 10 of the tau gene. Two of these mutations  N296N and N296H  lead to a clinical syndrome similar to autosomal dominant fronto-temporal dementia with Parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17. In contrast the third mutation  delN296  gives rise to atypical progressive supranuclear palsy in individuals homozygous for the mutation  but in heterozygous individuals this mutation is incompletely penetrant and associated with a phenotype similar to idiopathic Parkinson's disease. Functional assays were employed to determine the effects of these mutations on alternative splicing of exon 10  on microtubule assembly and self-aggregation of recombinant tau protein. We demonstrate that these mutations exhibit a spectrum of potentially pathogenic changes in tau function  and provide insight into the possible cause of the incompletely penetrant phenotype of the delN296 mutation.,0,Effects on splicing and protein function of three mutations in codon N296 of tau in vitro.Three Mutations were recently reported in the same codon (N296) in exon 10 of the tau gene.

20620,Discovery of dihydrochalcone as potential lead for Alzheimer's disease: in silico and in vitro study.,By the virtual screening method we have screened out Dihydrochalcone as a top-lead for the Alzheimer's disease using the database of about 32364 natural compounds. The binding affinity of this ligand to amyloid beta (AEEE) fibril has been thoroughly studied by computer simulation and experiment. Using the Thioflavin T (ThT) assay we have obtained the inhibition constant IC50 EEEM. This result is in good agreement with the estimation of the binding free energy obtained by the molecular mechanic-Poisson Boltzmann surface area method and all-atom simulation with the force field CHARMM 27 and water model TIP3P. Cell viability assays indicated that Dihydrochalcone could effectively reduce the cytotoxicity induced by AEEE. Thus  both in silico and in vitro studies show that Dihydrochalcone is a potential drug for the Alzheimers disease.,0,Discovery of dihydrochalcone as potential lead for Alzheimer's disease: in silico and in vitro study.By the virtual screening method we have screened out Dihydrochalcone as a top-lead for the Alzheimer's disease using the database of about 32364 natural compounds.

3675,False positive cerebrospinal fluid cryptococcus antigen in libman sacks endocarditis,LEARNING OBJECTIVE #1: Recognize false positive cerebrospinal fluid cryptococcal antigen of low titers in the setting of systemic lupus erythematous. LEARNING OBJECTIVE #2: Distinguish the clinical features of cryptococcal meningoencephalitis. CASE: 58 year old lady who presented with acute and suddent onset of altered mental status. It was described to be lethargy with slurring of the speech and inability to recognize her husband. Notably  our patient had a long history of SLE with secondary immune thrombocytopenic purpura. She was also formerly diagnosed with cerebral vasculitis and stable cerebral aneurysmal dilatation. For the past year she had been maintained on mycophenolate mofetil and hydrochloroquine. During evaluation  16 h after the initial symptom onset  the patient was back to her normal state of health. By that time no intervention had been done yet. On evaluation she was afebrile with stable vital signs and unremarkable findings on physical examination. She was awake  alert and fully oriented. She had no neck stiffness and had intact sensation and motor power in all four extremities. Reflexes were symmetric and cranial nerve exam was grossly intact. Her recent and remote memory were appropriate and she had fluent speech with no dysarthria. The initial work-up revealed a slightly elevated white blood cell count of 11.6 K/uL and a platelet count of 450 K/uL. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate and antinuclear antibody were at 72mm/h and 1:320 Titer  respectively. Angiographic computed tomography  to evaluate for aneurysmal rupture  revealed a stable small 2.5-3.0 mm carotid terminus aneurysm with no evidence of intra-cranial hemorrhage. CSF fluid sample was then obtained. The opening pressure  glucose and protein were all within normal limits  however there was evidence of mild pleocytosis with a total of 24 leukocytes /mm3. Few hours later CSF Cryptococcus antigen testing resulted as 1-2 Titer. At that time she was started on antifungal therapy with intravenous liposomal amphotericin B along with oral flucytosine. Given the paucity of congruent infectious signs along with the acuity of symptom onset and resolution  a repeat lumbar puncture was done 3 days later. On repeat analysis the leukocyte count dropped to 16/mm3 and the Cryptococcus antigen titer was negative. Results of India-ink examinations were negative and CSF cultures showed no growth on both occasions and therefore anti-fungal therapy was discontinued. Further assessment with magnetic resonance imaging showed signal abnormality within the cortex of the superior left frontal lobe with cortical enhancement favored to represent subacute ischemia of unknown etiology. A trans-esophageal echocardiogram  done to investigate for an embolic source  showed thickening and calcification of posterior mitral leaflet suggestive of SLE-associated valvular abnormalities. The patient was diagnosed with having thrombo-embolic cerebrovascular transient ischemia  for which she was started on long term anticoagulation. DISCUSSION: Cryptococcus neoformans meningoencephalitis usually presents in immuno-compromised patients. Typically  it presents as subacute to chronic meningitis with headache  lethargy  personality and memory change. In our patient  her presentation was more acute in both onset and resolution. Definitive diagnosis of Cryptococcus meningoencephalitis in HIV-seronegative patients requires a lumbar puncture with opening pressures and careful evaluation of the CSF with India-ink  antigen testing and cultures. While culturing the organism from the CSF is the preferred confirmatory test with a positive result in 90 % of non-AIDS patients  cultures can take 3-7 days to growin the laboratory. As prompt initiation of therapy is crucial  CSF Cryptococcus antigen testing has been established as an indispensable adjunct test with results available more rapidly. These assays possess a high degree of sensitivity and specificity  ranging 93- 100 % and 93-98 %  respectively. However  false positive results have been previously reported in the literature  and sually take place at extremely low titers (1:8 or under). While initial CSF evaluation revealed a positive Cryptococcus antigen assay  patient's symptoms were inconsistent with Cryptococcus meningoencephalitis  and a repeat CSF evaluation  done 3 days later  revealed a negative CSF Cryptococcus antigen assay. A significant proportion of serological studies in patients with SLE may have cross reactivity or non-specific interference from circulating autoantibodies causing false-positive results.

1817,Default-mode network activity distinguishes amnestic type mild cognitive impairment from healthy aging: a combined structural and resting-state functional MRI study.,Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)  have revealed coactivation in a distributed network that characterizes the default-mode in the human brain. However  details from resting-state imaging in amnestic type mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) is poorly understand. Regional homogeneity  which characterizes low-frequency blood oxygenation level dependent fluctuation  after statistically controlling for the regional atrophy and age in resting-state  were examined and compared between the two groups. When regional atrophy was controlled  decreased regional homogeneity in posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus still remained significant in aMCI patients. In addition the aMCI subjects displayed several regions of increased homogeneity  typically in right inferior parietal lobule  right fusiform gyrus and bilateral putamen. The impairment of posterior cingulate and precuneus could be an important marker to distinguish aMCI from healthy aging in the resting-state. Moreover  the increased regional homogeneity changes would be consistent with compensation for damage to the medial temporal regions and limbic structures  perhaps by recruitment of alternative regions.,0,Default-mode network activity distinguishes amnestic type mild cognitive impairment from healthy aging: a combined structural and resting-state functional MRI study.Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)  have revealed coactivation in a distributed network that characterizes the default-mode in the human brain.

26661,Reverse vaccinology assisted designing of multiepitope-based subunit vaccine against SARS-CoV-2,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) linked with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) cause severe illness and life-threatening pneumonia in humans. The current COVID-19 pandemic demands an effective vaccine to acquire protection against the infection. Therefore, the present study was aimed to design a multiepitope-based subunit vaccine (MESV) against COVID-19. METHODS: Structural proteins (Surface glycoprotein, Envelope protein, and Membrane glycoprotein) of SARS-CoV-2 are responsible for its prime functions. Sequences of proteins were downloaded from GenBank and several immunoinformatics coupled with computational approaches were employed to forecast B- and T- cell epitopes from the SARS-CoV-2 highly antigenic structural proteins to design an effective MESV. RESULTS: Predicted epitopes suggested high antigenicity, conserveness, substantial interactions with the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) binding alleles, and collective global population coverage of 88.40%. Taken together, 276 amino acids long MESV was designed by connecting 3 cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL), 6 helper T lymphocyte (HTL) and 4 B-cell epitopes with suitable adjuvant and linkers. The MESV construct was non-allergenic, stable, and highly antigenic. Molecular docking showed a stable and high binding affinity of MESV with human pathogenic toll-like receptors-3 (TLR3). Furthermore, in silico immune simulation revealed significant immunogenic response of MESV. Finally, MEV codons were optimized for its in silico cloning into the Escherichia coli K-12 system, to ensure its increased expression. CONCLUSION: The MESV developed in this study is capable of generating immune response against COVID-19. Therefore, if designed MESV further investigated experimentally, it would be an effective vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2 to control and prevent COVID-19.",0,"Reverse vaccinology assisted designing of multiepitope-based subunit vaccine against SARS-CoV-2BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) linked with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) cause severe illness and life-threatening pneumonia in humans.

I-125 brachy therapy has an established albeit limited role in surgically accessible recurrent gliomas. Carboplatin has anti-tumoral; activity against gliomas and demonstrated sensitization of tumor to radiotherapy. In 15 patients (age range 30-77 years; median 53) with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme  stereotactically placed catheters were afterloaded with I-125 sources. A median 50 Gy minimum treatment volume dose was delivered during a 100 h period in conjunction with continuous infusion carboplatin (100 mg/m(2)/20 h x 5). Tumor volumes ranged from 13 to 63 cm(3) (median  32 cm(3)). Early complications included: headache (n=7)  transient exacerbations of pre existing neurologic deficits (n=5)  seizures (n=2)  nausea/vomiting (n=2)  myelosuppression (n=2) and a catheter site wound CSF leak (n=1).

It derives from the proteolytic attacks of the beta-amyloid precursor protein (betaAPP) by beta- and gamma-secretase activities. An additional epsilon cleavage taking place a few residues C-terminal to the gamma-site has been reported  leading to the formation of an intracellular fragment referred to as APP intracellular domain C50.

Indeed  APP intracellular domain  like its Notch counterpart  appears to mediate important physiological functions. gamma and epsilon cleavages on betaAPP appear spatio-temporally linked but pharmacologically distinct and discriminable by mutagenesis approaches. As these cleavages could be seen as either deleterious (gamma-site) or beneficial (epsilon-site)  it appears of most interest to set up models aimed at studying these activities separately  particularly to design specific and bioavailable inhibitors. On the other hand  it is important to respect the topology of the substrates in order to examine physiologically relevant cleavages. Here we describe the obtention of cells overexpressing APPepsilon  the epsilon-secretase-derived N-terminal fragment of betaAPP.

Furthermore  APPepsilon is targeted by the beta-secretase beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme and is subsequently cleaved by gamma-secretase.

Rapid and innovative advances in digital media offer opportunities for health education, which could result in increased preventive behaviors. This study assessed preventive behaviors against contracting COVID-19 and tested mediation pathways linking four types of digital media consumption (social media, mobile social networking apps [MSNs], online news media, and social live steaming services [SLSSs]) to preventive behaviors, mediated by worry. Results from an online survey (N = 511) revealed that the vast majority (>90 percent) of respondents had very often or always practiced preventive behaviors against contracting COVID-19 such as washing their hands more regularly with soap and water, staying away from crowded places, and wearing face masks out in public. In addition, COVID-19 information seeking through the four types of digital media was a salient parameter that encouraged people to practice preventive behaviors either directly or indirectly. Specifically, seeking COVID-19-related information on MSNs, SLSSs, and online news media was directly associated with preventive behaviors.

After i.v. injection of a mixture of 3H-MET  14C-ETH and 11C- PRO into mice bearing FM3A mammary carcinoma  the highest FM3A uptake was found in 14C-ETH  followed by 3H-MET and 11C-PRO  while the FM3A-to- brain and FM3A-to-muscle ratios were nearly the same for all three compounds. The FM3A uptake of 14C-ETH and 11C-PRO were nearly equal or slightly higher than the liver uptake. In the pancreas  liver  FM3A and brain tissues  incorporation of 14C-ETH into acid-precipitable materials was much lower than that of 3H-MET  whereas no incorporation of 11C-PRO was found.

57853,Silent brain infarcts and the risk of dementia and cognitive decline.,BACKGROUND: Silent brain infarcts are frequently seen on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in healthy elderly people and may be associated with dementia and cognitive decline. METHODS: We studied the association between silent brain infarcts and the risk of dementia and cognitive decline in 1015 participants of the prospective  population-based Rotterdam Scan Study  who were 60 to 90 years of age and free of dementia and stroke at base line. Participants underwent neuropsychological testing and cerebral MRI at base line in 1995 to 1996 and again in 1999 to 2000 and were monitored for dementia throughout the study period. We performed Cox proportional-hazards and multiple linear-regression analyses  adjusted for age  sex  and level of education and for the presence or absence of subcortical atrophy and white-matter lesions. RESULTS: During 3697 person-years of follow-up (mean per person  3.6 years)  dementia developed in 30 of the 1015 participants. The presence of silent brain infarcts at base line more than doubled the risk of dementia (hazard ratio  2.26; 95 percent confidence interval  1.09 to 4.70). The presence of silent brain infarcts on the base-line MRI was associated with worse performance on neuropsychological tests and a steeper decline in global cognitive function. Silent thalamic infarcts were associated with a decline in memory performance  and nonthalamic infarcts with a decline in psychomotor speed. When participants with silent brain infarcts at base line were subdivided into those with and those without additional infarcts at follow-up  the decline in cognitive function was restricted to those with additional silent infarcts. CONCLUSIONS: Elderly people with silent brain infarcts have an increased risk of dementia and a steeper decline in cognitive function than those without such lesions.,0,Silent brain infarcts and the risk of dementia and cognitive decline.BACKGROUND: Silent brain infarcts are frequently seen on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in healthy elderly people and may be associated with dementia and cognitive decline.

38392,Overexpression of the neuritotrophic cytokine S100beta precedes the appearance of neuritic beta-amyloid plaques in APPV717F mice.,Homozygous APPV717F transgenic mice overexpress a human beta-amyloid precursor protein (betaAPP) minigene encoding a familial Alzheimer's disease mutation. These mice develop Alzheimer-type neuritic beta-amyloid plaques surrounded by astrocytes. S100beta is an astrocyte-derived cytokine that promotes neurite growth and promotes excessive expression of betaAPP. S100beta overexpression in Alzheimer's disease correlates with the proliferation of betaAPP-immunoreactive neurites in beta-amyloid plaques. We found age-related increases in tissue levels of both betaAPP and S100beta mRNA in transgenic mice. Neuronal betaAPP overexpression was found in cell somas in young mice  whereas older mice showed betaAPP overexpression in dystrophic neurites in plaques. These age-related changes were accompanied by progressive increases in S100beta expression  as determined by S100beta load (percent immunoreactive area). These increases were evident as early as 1 and 2 months of age  months before the appearance of beta-amyloid deposits in these mice. Such precocious astrocyte activation and S100beta overexpression are similar to our earlier findings in Down's syndrome. Accelerated age-related overexpression of S100beta may interact with age-associated overexpression of mutant betaAPP in transgenic mice to promote development of Alzheimer-like neuropathological changes.,0,Overexpression of the neuritotrophic cytokine S100beta precedes the appearance of neuritic beta-amyloid plaques in APPV717F mice.Homozygous APPV717F transgenic mice overexpress a human beta-amyloid precursor protein (betaAPP) minigene encoding a familial Alzheimer's disease mutation. These mice develop Alzheimer-type neuritic beta-amyloid plaques surrounded by astrocytes. S100beta is an astrocyte-derived cytokine that promotes neurite growth and promotes excessive expression of betaAPP. S100beta overexpression in Alzheimer's disease correlates with the proliferation of betaAPP-immunoreactive neurites in beta-amyloid plaques. We found age-related increases in tissue levels of both betaAPP and S100beta mRNA in transgenic mice. Neuronal betaAPP overexpression was found in cell somas in young mice  whereas older mice showed betaAPP overexpression in dystrophic neurites in plaques. These age-related changes were accompanied by progressive increases in S100beta expression  as determined by S100beta load (percent immunoreactive area). These increases were evident as early as 1 and 2 months of age  months before the appearance of beta-amyloid deposits in these mice. Such precocious astrocyte activation and S100beta overexpression are similar to our earlier findings in Down's syndrome.

19121,Hyperpyrexia in COVID-19 patients,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a global health emergency, in which its effective treatment and prevention remain obscured. Hyperpyrexia is an elevation of body temperature (BT) above 106.7 degreeF (41.5 degreeC) due to an abnormally increased hypothalamic thermo-regulatory set. The pathophysiology, impact, and outcomes of hyperpyrexia in COVID-19 patients have not yet been studied. Herein, we present clinical features and outcomes of six COVID-19 patients who had developed hyperpyrexia during hospitalization. All patients expired shortly after the onset of hyperpyrexia. Hyperpyrexia seems to adversely impact the outcomes and mortality in patients with COVID-19. The underlying mechanisms of developing hyperpyrexia in COVID-19 are mysterious. We propose it may be caused by SARS-CoV-2 related brain injury, exuberant immune response, and thrombus formation. More research is needed to verify our results. Understanding the association between hyperpyrexia and SARS-CoV-2 will help to elucidate the COVID-19 pathogenesis, which is mandatory for developing effective treatment strategies.

35460,Does This Adult Patient With Jolt Accentuation of Headache Have Acute Meningitis?,OBJECTIVE: In order to identify appropriate candidates with suspected meningitis for lumbar puncture (LP)  study designs and diagnostic values of jolt accentuation of headache (JA) were reviewed.  BACKGROUND: Acute meningitis is a life-threatening disease that requires LP for accurate diagnosis. JA was reported the most sensitive indicator of cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis; however  subsequent studies have failed to confirm this claim.  METHODS: We reviewed articles concerning JA  published prior to December 2017  using MEDLINE and Japanese medical databases. Seven original articles based on independent cohorts were eligible for inclusion and articles citing these 7 were thoroughly searched (11 in total). Additionally  all medical records of our previously reported cohort were reviewed again to explore how the patients' background influenced diagnostic values of JA.  RESULTS: We hypothesized that an oversimplified dichotomy of JA findings  pleocytosis  and meningitis created a misconception that JA is a universal indicator of meningitis. We clarify the difference between them and present altered mental status (AMS) as a key to decrease the sensitivity of JA. Notably  the sensitivity and specificity of JA were relatively low in unselected groups  while they tended to be high in the selected sub-groups with acute onset of headache and fever  without AMS or neurological deficits. Unselected populations included etiologies of pleocytosis other than acute meningitis  which might weaken the association between JA and pleocytosis.  CONCLUSION: JA is not a universal  stand-alone  indicator of meningitis in febrile patients with headache. Therefore  we propose a stepwise approach for patients with suspected acute meningitis. AMS or neurological deficits suggest an intracranial pathology  which may necessitate a lumbar puncture. JA seems a useful tool for distinguishing acute aseptic meningitis from upper respiratory infection when used in the selected cohort of febrile patients (>=37degreeC) with recent-onset headache (within 2 weeks before presentation) and normal mental status. This approach and diagnostic values of JA should be further investigated by prospective studies using operationally sorted candidates.Copyright © 2018 American Headache Society.,1,Does This Adult Patient With Jolt Accentuation of Headache Have Acute Meningitis?OBJECTIVE: In order to identify appropriate candidates with suspected meningitis for lumbar puncture (LP)  study designs and diagnostic values of jolt accentuation of headache (JA) were reviewed.

37796,Association between weather data and COVID-19 pandemic predicting mortality rate: Machine learning approaches,"Nowadays, a significant number of infectious diseases such as human coronavirus disease (COVID-19) are threatening the world by spreading at an alarming rate. Some of the literatures pointed out that the pandemic is exhibiting seasonal patterns in its spread, incidence and nature of the distribution. In connection to the spread and distribution of the infection, scientific analysis that answers the questions whether the next summer can save people from COVID-19 is required. Many researchers have been exclusively asked whether high temperature during summer can slow down the spread of the COVID-19 as it has with other seasonal flues. Since there are a lot of questions that are unanswered right now, and many mysteries aspects about the COVID-19 that is still unknown to us, in-depth study and analysis of associated weather features are required. Moreover, understanding the nature of COVID-19 and forecasting the spread of COVID-19 request more investigation of the real effect of weather variables on the transmission of the COVID-19 among people. In this work, various regressor machine learning models are proposed to extract the relationship between different factors and the spreading rate of COVID-19. The machine learning algorithms employed in this work estimate the impact of weather variables such as temperature and humidity on the transmission of COVID-19 by extracting the relationship between the number of confirmed cases and the weather variables on certain regions. To validate the proposed method, we have collected the required datasets related to weather and census features and necessary prepossessing is carried out. From the experimental results, it is shown that the weather variables are more relevant in predicting the mortality rate when compared to the other census variables such as population, age, and urbanization. Thus, from this result, we can conclude that temperature and humidity are important features for predicting COVID-19 mortality rate. Moreover, it is indicated that the higher the value of temperature the lower number of infection cases. Copyright ÁE© 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

The consequences of the accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau in the somatodendritic compartment remain poorly characterized at the early stage of disease before the formation of tau insoluble filaments. We investigated the ultrastructural changes induced by this accumulation in the neuronal soma of motor neurons in asymptomatic JNPL3 mice that overexpress mutant tau  P301L. More numerous contacts between rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) membranes and mitochondria were observed in JNLP3 mice compared with wild-type mice. This correlated with a preferential increase of the amount of tau at the surface of RER membranes but not at the surface of mitochondria  as revealed by tau immunogold labeling. Using a subcellular fractionation procedure  an increased amount of phosphorylated tau was identified in the rough microsome subfraction  wherein the RER marker  ribophorin  was enriched. A similar increase was noted in the rough microsome subfraction isolated from Alzheimer disease brains. The association of hyperphosphorylated tau with ER membranes was confirmed by double immunogold labeling of the subfraction enriched in ER membranes isolated from Alzheimer disease brains.

23467,"Nursing Diagnoses for Coronavirus Disease, COVID-19: Identification by Taxonomic Triangulation","PURPOSE: To identify the nursing care problems related to the clinical process of disease by COVID-19. METHOD: The study applied the taxonomic triangulation technique on a clinical management guide to coronavirus disease, COVID-19, from the World Health Organization. The technique is divided into the phases: extraction of knowledge in natural language about assessment, planning and intervention, translation into standard language NOC and NIC, linking to NANDA-I diagnoses, triangulation looking for diagnostic matches in the three sets, and, finally, validation by a panel of experts from a hospital and a university. FINDINGS: The extraction identified 159 terms in natural language that were translated into 173 variables: 34 NOC for assessment, 19 NOC for planning, and 120 NIC for intervention. The relationships to NANDA-I diagnoses recorded 2,182 links and the triangulation returned 109 diagnoses, 54 of them for a critical situation. The panel of experts unanimously validated the 29 diagnoses with the highest number of links. CONCLUSION: Coronavirus disease, COVID-19, involves a complex situation with multiple associated care problems that can be identified using the taxonomic triangulation technique.

Three neocortical areas  the hippocampus  and the cerebellum of 20 CJD  10 AD and 10 control patients were immunohistochemically examined for the presence of astroglia  microglia  and protein depositions. To investigate the level of oxidative stress the percentage of neurons with cytoplasmic hydroxylated DNA was determined. Astroglia  microglia and oxidative stress were located around amyloid-beta depositions and a clear quantitative relation was identified. These markers were only increased in the hippocampus of AD compared to controls. Quantitative analysis in these groups showed a correlation between the oxidative stress level and the number of microglia in the grey matter. All markers were increased in the grey matter and the cerebellum of CJD when compared to AD and controls. The highest numbers of lesions were observed in a CJD population with a rapid disease progression. Quantitative analysis showed a correlation between the oxidative stress level and all glial cells. Further analysis showed that the number of microglia was related to the intensity of the prion depositions. Glial cells in the brain are thought to be the main producers of oxidative stress  resulting in neuronal death. Our results confirm that this close relationship exists in both AD and CJD.

Some orthopaedic surgeons in Wuhan were infected with COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted a survey to identify the orthopaedic surgeons who were infected with COVID-19 in Wuhan. A self-administered questionnaire was distributed to collect information such as social demographic variables, clinical manifestations, exposure history, awareness of the outbreak, infection control training provided by hospitals, and individual protection practices. To further explore the possible risk factors at the individual level, a 1:2 matched case-control study was conducted. RESULTS: A total of 26 orthopaedic surgeons from 8 hospitals in Wuhan were identified as having COVID-19. The incidence in each hospital varied from 1.5% to 20.7%. The onset of symptoms was from January 13 to February 5, 2020, and peaked on January 23, 8 days prior to the peak of the public epidemic. The suspected sites of exposure were general wards (79.2%), public places at the hospital (20.8%), operating rooms (12.5%), the intensive care unit (4.2%), and the outpatient clinic (4.2%). There was transmission from these doctors to others in 25% of cases, including to family members (20.8%), to colleagues (4.2%), to patients (4.2%), and to friends (4.2%). Participation in real-time training on prevention measures was found to have a protective effect against COVID-19 (odds ratio [OR], 0.12). Not wearing an N95 respirator was found to be a risk factor (OR, 5.20 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.09 to 25.00]). Wearing respirators or masks all of the time was found to be protective (OR, 0.15). Severe fatigue was found to be a risk factor (OR, 4 [95% CI, 1 to 16]) for infection with COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Orthopaedic surgeons are at risk during the COVID-19 pandemic. Common places of work could be contaminated. Orthopaedic surgeons have to be more vigilant and take more precautions to avoid infection with COVID-19. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Diagnostic Level IV.

Participation in real-time training on prevention measures was found to have a protective effect against COVID-19 (odds ratio [OR], 0.12). Not wearing an N95 respirator was found to be a risk factor (OR, 5.20 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.09 to 25.00]). Wearing respirators or masks all of the time was found to be protective (OR, 0.15). Severe fatigue was found to be a risk factor (OR, 4 [95% CI, 1 to 16]) for infection with COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Orthopaedic surgeons are at risk during the COVID-19 pandemic. Common places of work could be contaminated. Orthopaedic surgeons have to be more vigilant and take more precautions to avoid infection with COVID-19. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Diagnostic Level IV.

72,Assessment of endocrine disorders of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis by nuclear medicine techniques,The following article reviews nuclear medicine techniques which can be used for assessment of endocrine disorders of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. For planar and SPECT imaging somatostatin-receptor- and dopamine-D2-receptor-scintigraphy are the most widely distributed techniques. These nuclear medicine techniques may be indicated in selected cases to answer differential diagnostic problems. They can be helpful to search for presence and localization of receptor positive tissue. Furthermore they can detect metastasis in the rare cases of a pituitary carcinoma. Scintigraphy with Gallium-67 is suitable for further diagnostic evaluation in suspected hypophysitis. Other SPECT radiopharmaca do not have relevant clinical significance. F-18-FDG as PET radiopharmacon is not ideal because obvious pituitary adenomas could not be visualized. Other PET radiopharmaca including C-11-methionine  C-11-tyrosine  F-18-fluoroethylspiperone  C-11-methylspiperone  and C-11-raclopride are available in specialized centers only. Overall indications for nuclear medicine in studies for the assessment of endocrine disorders of the hypothalamic-pituitary-axis are rare. Original studies often report only about a small number of patients. According to the authors' opinion the relevance of nuclear medicine in studies of clinically important endocrinologic fields  e.g. localization of small ACTH-producing pituitary adenomas  tumor localization in ectopic ACTH syndrome  localization of recurrent pituitary tissue  assessment of small incidentalomas  can not be definitely given yet,0,Assessment of endocrine disorders of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis by nuclear medicine techniquesThe following article reviews nuclear medicine techniques which can be used for assessment of endocrine disorders of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis.

Here  we find that both subunits of calcineurin bind tau  and calmodulin interferes with the association between calcineurin and tau. The domains of both subunits of calcineurin and tau involved in binding are mapped. We also investigate the functional consequences of the interactions between both subunits of calcineurin  tau and calmodulin  and reveal the interactions affect dephosphorylation of tau by calcineurin and contribute to the balance of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of tau in vivo. Our findings may be of potential significance in neuronal physiology and also in neurodegenerative disorders. They shed some light on how the interactions might control the phosphorylation state of tau under physiological conditions  and provide new insights into the treatment of tauopathies such as Alzheimer's disease.,0,"Tau binds both subunits of calcineurin, and binding is impaired by calmodulin.Calcineurin  an important protein Ser/Thr phosphatase which acts on tau in vivo  is a heterodimer of a catalytic subunit  calcineurin A  and a regulatory subunit  calcineurin B  and is unique in being regulated by calmodulin.

8382,Brain tumor imaging with PET and 2-[carbon-11]thymidine,Methods: To assess the potential of thymidine for imaging brain tumors  20 patients with untreated (n = 14) and recurrent (n = 6) supratentorial intracranial tumors were studied with PET by using 2-[11C]thymidine (Tdr)  and the results were compared with [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET data. Results: Blood analysis consistently revealed a rapid clearance of the intact Tdr together with the appearance of CO2/HCO3/- that  with time  accounted for approximately 70% of the total blood activity. As soon as 10 min after tracer injection  brain images showed a low and homogeneous Tdr distribution over the normal brain structures (cortex-to-blood ratio approximately 1). Visual and quantitative analysis revealed increased Tdr uptake (tumor-to- cortex ratio EEE 1.2) in 11 of 14 untreated tumors and in 5 of 6 recurrent tumors. No correlation was found between Tdr uptake and tumor grade. In 12 of the 14 untreated tumors  FDG uptake was low (tumor-to-cortex ratio: 0.83 EEE 0.79)  but a FDG hot spot was visualized in 8 of 10 high-grade and in none of the 4 low-grade tumors.

15042,Optimizing clinical monitoring of central nervous system involvement in SLE,Central Nervous System (CNS) involvement is a frequent SLE manifestation occurring in 15-75% of patients. However  diagnosis of CNS involvement is a difficult task and requires a careful clinical and laboratory assessment along with instrumental evaluation. In recent years major advances in neuroimaging techniques allowed a great improvement in our understanding of SLE pathogenesis. Anyway  since no single imaging technique covers all brain pathology and both inflammation and neurodegeneration contribute to SLE pathogenesis  it is very important to use a multimodality approach coupling a morphological with a functional imaging modality. In this setting  to date  conventional magnetic resonance imaging and single photon emission computed tomography are the most largely available and accessible techniques. Modern techniques such as perfusion weighted imaging  diffusion weighted imaging  magnetization transfer imaging and magnetic resonance spectroscopy provide useful information to assess brain tissue damage however  their clinical relevance in individual patients needs further evidence. In this review we would like to summarize what have we learned in the last few years about neuroimaging in NPSLE  what have been major advances in neuroimaging techniques and  finally  we would like to give some suggestions about what should be done in daily clinical practice to approach SLE patients with NP symptoms.,0,Optimizing clinical monitoring of central nervous system involvement in SLECentral Nervous System (CNS) involvement is a frequent SLE manifestation occurring in 15-75% of patients.

46687,Intestinal ultrasound accurately assesses disease activity in inflammatory bowel disease when compared to faecal calprotectin,"Introduction Current guidelines recommend a treat to target approach in the management of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) utilising objective measures of disease activity. Faecal calprotectin is a non-invasive biomarker which has been shown to be a surrogate marker for mucosal healing. However, calprotectin has significant limitations including a lack of information regarding disease location, inter-patient variability and moderate rates of both false negative and positive results. Intestinal ultrasound (IUS) is a non-invasive imaging modality which has the ability to provide information on both disease activity and location. There is a paucity of data comparing the accuracy of IUS to calprotectin results. Aim To assess the accuracy of IUS compared to calprotectin levels in evaluating disease activity in IBD. Methods A prospective IUS database for all imaging is maintained at the Alfred Hospital. All patients with an IUS and faecal calprotectin performed within 7 days of each other in 2014 were enrolled. C-reactive protein (CRP) values were also analysed with a CRP <3mg/L considered normal. IUS was performed by one of two IBD gastroenterologists with expertise in IUS. Statistical analyses were undertaken to assess the accuracy of IUS using different thresholds for calprotectin including 30EEEg/g, 50EEEg/g, 100EEEg/g and 250EEEg/ g. Results The database included 139 patients (47% females) with the majority having Crohn's disease (86%). Forty-eight IUS patients had matched faecal calprotectin levels. Sensitivities, specificities, positive (PPV) and negative predictive values (NPV) are shown in Table 1. For each threshold, IUS had very high negative predictive values. Conversely, IUS had a high positive predictive value only when calprotectin levels exceeded 250EEEg/g. 107 patients undergoing an IUS had a matched CRP measured with 7 days of the scan. 45 patients had an elevated CRP. The sensitivity and specificity of CRP with positive IUS findings were 65% and 68% respectively.

52295,The role of low-density receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) as a competitive substrate of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) for BACE1.,Cleavage of APP by BACE1 is the first proteolytic step in the production of amyloid-beta (Abeta)  which accumulates in senile plaques in Alzheimer's disease. Through its interaction with APP  the low-density receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) enhances APP internalization. Recently  BACE1 has been shown to interact with and cleave the light chain (lc) of LRP1. Since LRP1 is known to compete with APP for cleavage by gamma-secretase  we tested the hypothesis that LRP1 also acts as a competitive substrate for beta-secretase. We found that the increase in secreted APP (sAPP) mediated by over-expression of BACE1 in APP-transfected cells could be decreased by simultaneous LRP1 over-expression. Analysis by multi-spot ELISA revealed that this is due to a decrease in sAPPbeta  but not sAPPalpha. Interaction between APP and BACE1  as measured by immunoprecipitation and fluorescence lifetime assays  was impaired by LRP1 over-expression. We also demonstrate that APP over-expression leads to decreased LRP1 association with and cleavage by BACE1. In conclusion  our data suggest that--in addition to its role in APP trafficking--LRP1 affects APP processing by competing for cleavage by BACE1.,0,The role of low-density receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) as a competitive substrate of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) for BACE1.Cleavage of APP by BACE1 is the first proteolytic step in the production of amyloid-beta (Abeta)  which accumulates in senile plaques in Alzheimer's disease.

582,Aerodynamic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 in two Wuhan hospitals,"The ongoing COVID-19 outbreak has spread rapidly on a global scale. While the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 via human respiratory droplets and direct contact is clear, the potential for aerosol transmission is poorly understood1-3. This study investigated the aerodynamic nature of SARS-CoV-2 by measuring viral RNA in aerosols in different areas of two Wuhan hospitals during the COVID-19 outbreak in February and March 2020. The concentration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in aerosols detected in isolation wards and ventilated patient rooms was very low, but it was elevated in the patients' toilet areas. Levels of airborne SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the majority of public areas was undetectable except in two areas prone to crowding, possibly due to infected carriers in the crowd. We found that some medical staff areas initially had high concentrations of viral RNA with aerosol size distributions showing peaks in submicrometre and/or supermicrometre regions, but these levels were reduced to undetectable levels after implementation of rigorous sanitization procedures. Although we have not established the infectivity of the virus detected in these hospital areas, we propose that SARS-CoV-2 may have the potential to be transmitted via aerosols. Our results indicate that room ventilation, open space, sanitization of protective apparel, and proper use and disinfection of toilet areas can effectively limit the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in aerosols.

18721,Response of major air pollutants to COVID-19 lockdowns in China,"COVID-19 suddenly struck Wuhan at the end of 2019 and soon spread to the whole country and the rest of world in 2020. To mitigate the pandemic, China authority has taken unprecedentedly strict measures across the country. That provides a precious window to study how the air quality response to quick decline of anthropogenic emissions in terms of national scale, which would be critical basis to make atmospheric governance policies in the future. In this work, we utilized observations from both remote sensing and in-situ measurements to investigate impacts of COVID-19 lockdown on different air pollutions in different regions of China. It is witnessed that the PM2.5 concentrations exhibited distinct trends in different regions, despite of plunges of NO2 concentrations over the whole country. The steady HCHO concentration in urban area provides sufficient fuels for generations of tropospheric O3, leading to high concentrations of O3, especially when there is not enough NO to consume O3 via the titration effect. Moreover, the SO2 concentration kept steady at a low level regardless of cities. As a conclusion, the COVID-19 lockdown indeed helped reduce NO2 concentration. However, the atmospheric quality in urban areas of China has not improved overall due to lockdown measures. It underscores the significance of comprehensive control of atmospheric pollutants in cleaning air. Reducing VOCs (volatile organic compounds) concentrations in urban areas would be a critical mission for better air quality in the future.Copyright ÁE© 2020 Elsevier B.V.",0,"Response of major air pollutants to COVID-19 lockdowns in ChinaCOVID-19 suddenly struck Wuhan at the end of 2019 and soon spread to the whole country and the rest of world in 2020.

67671,"Characteristics, Comorbidities, and Outcomes in a Multicenter Registry of Patients with HIV and Coronavirus Disease-19","BACKGROUND: People with HIV (PWH) may have numerous risk factors for acquiring Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) and developing severe outcomes, but current data are conflicting. METHODS: Healthcare providers enrolled consecutively by non-random sampling PWH with lab-confirmed COVID-19, diagnosed at their facilities between April 1st and July 1st, 2020. De-identified data were entered into an electronic Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap). The primary endpoint was severe outcome, defined as a composite endpoint of intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation, or death. The secondary outcome was the need for hospitalization. RESULTS: 286 patients were included; the mean age was 51.4 years (SD, 14.4), 25.9% were female, and 75.4% were African-American or Hispanic. Most patients (94.3%) were on antiretroviral therapy (ART), 88.7% had HIV virologic suppression, and 80.8% had comorbidities. Within 30 days of positive SARS-CoV-2 testing, 164 (57.3%) patients were hospitalized, and 47 (16.5%) required ICU admission. Mortality rates were 9.4% (27/286) overall, 16.5% (27/164) among those hospitalized, and 51.5% (24/47) among those admitted to an ICU. The primary composite endpoint occurred in 17.5% (50/286) of all patients and 30.5% (50/164) of hospitalized patients. Older age, chronic lung disease, and hypertension were associated with severe outcomes. A lower CD4 count (<200 cells/mm3) was associated with the primary and secondary endpoints. There was no association between the antiretroviral regimen or lack of viral suppression and predefined outcomes. CONCLUSION: Severe clinical outcomes occurred commonly in PWH and COVID-19. The risk for poor outcomes was higher in those with comorbidities and lower CD4 cell counts, despite HIV viral suppression. Copyright ÁE© The Author(s) 2020.

35103,Voxelwise spectral diffusional connectivity and its applications to Alzheimer's disease and intelligence prediction.,Human brain connectivity can be studied using graph theory. Many connectivity studies parcellate the brain into regions and count fibres extracted between them.

16965,A longitudinal EEG study of Alzheimer's disease progression based on a complex network approach.,A complex network approach is combined with time dynamics in order to conduct a space-time analysis applicable to longitudinal studies aimed to characterize the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in individual patients. The network analysis reveals how patient-specific patterns are associated with disease progression  also capturing the widespread effect of local disruptions. This longitudinal study is carried out on resting electroence phalography (EEGs) of seven AD patients. The test is repeated after a three months' period. The proposed methodology allows to extract some averaged information and regularities on the patients' cohort and to quantify concisely the disease evolution. From the functional viewpoint  the progression of AD is shown to be characterized by a loss of connected areas here measured in terms of network parameters (characteristic path length  clustering coefficient  global efficiency  degree of connectivity and connectivity density). The differences found between baseline and at follow-up are statistically significant. Finally  an original topographic multiscale approach is proposed that yields additional results.,0,A longitudinal EEG study of Alzheimer's disease progression based on a complex network approach.A complex network approach is combined with time dynamics in order to conduct a space-time analysis applicable to longitudinal studies aimed to characterize the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in individual patients.

27805,Measurement of clinical and subclinical tumour response using [18F]- fluorodeoxyglucose and positron emission tomography: Review and 1999 EORTC recommendations,[18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose ([18F]-FDG) uptake is enhanced in most malignant tumours which in turn can be measured using positron emission tomography (PET). A number of small clinical trials have indicated that quantification of the change in tumour [18F]-FDG uptake may provide an early  sensitive  pharmacodynamic marker of the tumoricidal effect of anticancer drugs. This may allow for the introduction of subclinical response for anticancer drug evaluation in early clinical trials and improvements in patient management. For comparison of results from smaller clinical trials and larger-scale multicentre trials a consensus is desirable for: (i) common measurement criteria; and (ii) reporting of alterations in [18F]-FDG uptake with treatment.

59340,Positron emission tomography-based boron neutron capture therapy using boronophenylalanine for high-grade gliomas: part I,Determination of tumor boron-10 (10B) levels is required for accurate neutron dosimetry during boron neutron capture therapy. We assessed a new method for quantitative measurement of boronated drug uptake in high-grade gliomas. This method uses positron emission tomography (PET) with fluorine-18-labeled L-fluoroborono-phenylalanine (L-18F-10B-FBPA)  which was synthesized as an analogue of L-boronophenylalanine. We studied the accumulation of L-18F-10B-FBPA by PET in patients with high-grade gliomas. Dynamic PET studies of brain tumors revealed that L-18F-10B-FBPA accumulated gradually after bolus injection  and the value of PET activity divided by the integrated plasma activity reached a constant level 42 min after injection  which was defined as the incorporation constant (Ic*). This constant reflected the appropriate L-18F-10B-FBPA accumulation in tumor tissue. Based on the Ic* constant  the methods for estimating tumor 10B concentration were devised. With this method  the estimated values of 10B concentration in gliomas were very close to the 10B levels in surgical specimens. This method was based solely on PET and can potentially provide data that would assist in the selection of patients for future treatment with boron neutron capture therapy after surgical resection of their brain tumors,0,Positron emission tomography-based boron neutron capture therapy using boronophenylalanine for high-grade gliomas: part IDetermination of tumor boron-10 (10B) levels is required for accurate neutron dosimetry during boron neutron capture therapy.

55185,Dynamical coupling of intrinsically disordered proteins and their hydration water: comparison with folded soluble and membrane proteins.,Hydration water is vital for various macromolecular biological activities  such as specific ligand recognition  enzyme activity  response to receptor binding  and energy transduction. Without hydration water  proteins would not fold correctly and would lack the conformational flexibility that animates their three-dimensional structures. Motions in globular  soluble proteins are thought to be governed to a certain extent by hydration-water dynamics  yet it is not known whether this relationship holds true for other protein classes in general and whether  in turn  the structural nature of a protein also influences water motions. Here  we provide insight into the coupling between hydration-water dynamics and atomic motions in intrinsically disordered proteins (IDP)  a largely unexplored class of proteins that  in contrast to folded proteins  lack a well-defined three-dimensional structure. We investigated the human IDP tau  which is involved in the pathogenic processes accompanying Alzheimer disease. Combining neutron scattering and protein perdeuteration  we found similar atomic mean-square displacements over a large temperature range for the tau protein and its hydration water  indicating intimate coupling between them. This is in contrast to the behavior of folded proteins of similar molecular weight  such as the globular  soluble maltose-binding protein and the membrane protein bacteriorhodopsin  which display moderate to weak coupling  respectively. The extracted mean square displacements also reveal a greater motional flexibility of IDP compared with globular  folded proteins and more restricted water motions on the IDP surface. The results provide evidence that protein and hydration-water motions mutually affect and shape each other  and that there is a gradient of coupling across different protein classes that may play a functional role in macromolecular activity in a cellular context.,0,Dynamical coupling of intrinsically disordered proteins and their hydration water: comparison with folded soluble and membrane proteins.Hydration water is vital for various macromolecular biological activities  such as specific ligand recognition  enzyme activity  response to receptor binding  and energy transduction.

METHODS: The FAB was administered to 177 patients with AD  and regional cerebral glucose metabolism (rCMglc) was measured by FDG-PET scan. Correlations between FAB scores and rCMglc were explored using both region-of-interest-based (ROI-based) and voxel-based approaches. RESULTS: The ROI-based analysis showed that FAB scores correlated with the rCMglc of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortices. Voxel-based approach revealed significant positive correlations between FAB scores and rCMglc which were in various cortical regions including the temporal and parietal cortices as well as frontal regions  independent of age  gender  and education. After controlling the effect of global disease severity with Mini-Mental State Examination score  significant positive correlation was found only in the bilateral prefrontal regions. CONCLUSIONS: Although FAB scores are influenced by temporoparietal dysfunction due to the overall progression of AD  it likely reflects prefrontal dysfunction specifically regardless of global cognitive state or disease severity in patients with AD.,0,Functional Neuroanatomical Correlates of The Frontal Assessment Battery Performance in Alzheimer Disease: A FDG-PET Study.BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: We aimed to elucidate the functional neuroanatomical correlates of Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB) performances by applying [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) to a large population of patients with Alzheimer disease (AD).

29,"Shunt related changes in somatostatin, neuropeptide Y, and corticotropin releasing factor concentrations in patients with normal pressure hydrocephalus.",OBJECTIVES: Recent data indicate that alterations in brain neuropeptides may play a pathogenic role in dementia. Neuropeptide Y (NPY)  somastostatin (SOM)  and corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) are neuropeptides involved in cognitive performance. Decreased SOM and NPY concentrations have been found in patients with normal pressure hydrocephalus and are probably the result of neuronal dysfunction  which could potentially be restored by shunting. The effects of shunt surgery on preoperative SOM  NPY  and CRF concentrations were studied. Any improvements in neuropeptide concentrations that could lead to clinically significant neuropsychological and functional changes were also investigated. METHODS: A prospective study was performed in 14 patients with normal pressure hydrocephalus syndrome with a duration of symptoms between 3 months and 12 years. Diagnosis was based on intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring and CSF dynamics. Concentrations of SOM  NPY  and CRF in lumbar CSF were determined before shunting and again 6-9 months after surgery. A battery of neuropsychological tests and several rating functional scales were also given to patients before and after shunting. RESULTS: After shunting  SOM and CRF concentrations were significantly increased in all patients. Concentrations of NPY were increased in 12 of the 14 patients studied. The clinical condition of 13 of the 14 patients was significantly improved 6 months after surgery. This improvement was more pronounced in gait disturbances and sphincter dysfunction than in cognitive impairment. No significant differences in any of the neuropsychological tests were seen for the group of patients as a whole despite the increased neuropeptide concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: Shunting can restore SOM  NPY  and CRF concentrations even in patients with longstanding normal pressure hydrocephalus. However  despite the biochemical and clinical improvement in some areas such as ambulation and daily life activities  cognitive performance did not significantly improve. The role of neuropeptides in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with normal pressure hydrocephalus syndrome is discussed.,0,"Shunt related changes in somatostatin, neuropeptide Y, and corticotropin releasing factor concentrations in patients with normal pressure hydrocephalus.OBJECTIVES: Recent data indicate that alterations in brain neuropeptides may play a pathogenic role in dementia.

Clinical features of COVID-19 patients were described and the parameters of clinical characteristics between the two groups were compared. RESULTS: The rates of the acute cardiac and kidney complications were higher in IMV cases than those in NIV cases. Most patients had lymphocytopenia on admission, with lymphocyte levels dropping progressively on the following days, and the more severe lymphopenia developed in the IMV group. In both groups, T lymphocyte counts were below typical lower limit norms compared to B lymphocytes. On admission, both groups had higher than expected amounts of plasma interleukin-6 (IL-6), which over time declined more in NIV patients. The prothrombin time was increased and the levels of platelet, hemoglobin, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), D-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and IL-6 were higher in IMV cases compared with NIV cases during hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: Data showed that the rates of complications, dynamics of lymphocytopenia, and changes in levels of platelet, hemoglobin, BUN, D-dimer, LDH and IL-6, and prothrombin time in these ICU patients were significantly different between IMV and NIV cases.",0,"Clinical characteristics of 34 COVID-19 patients admitted to intensive care unit in Hangzhou, ChinaOBJECTIVE: This study summarizes and compares clinical and laboratory characteristics of 34 patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for complications from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) at the First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China from Jan. 22 to Mar. 5, 2020.

60626,Seroprevalence of N-methyl-D-aspartate glutamate receptor (NMDA-R) autoantibodies in aging subjects without neuropsychiatric disorders and in dementia patients.,N-methyl-D-aspartate glutamate receptors (NMDA-R) play a key role in learning and memory. Therefore  they may be involved in the pathophysiology of dementia. NMDA-R autoantibodies directed against the NR1a subunit of the NMDA-R  which were first identified as a specific marker for a severe form of encephalitis  cause a decrease in NMDA-Rs  resulting in cognitive impairment and psychosis. We examined the prevalence of NR1a NMDA-R autoantibodies in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 24 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD)  20 patients with subcortical ischemic vascular dementia (SIVD)  and 274 volunteers without neuropsychiatric disorder. The latter cases showed an association of seropositivity with age. Notably  the overall seroprevalence was not statistically different between dementia patients and matched controls. Further analysis of the patient samples showed that four patients with AD and three patients with SIVD had positive NMDA-R IgM  IgG  and/or IgA autoantibody titers in serum. These patients suffered from psychosis (with the exception of one case). CSF samples were negative for NMDA-R autoantibodies. We conclude that the seroprevalence of NMDA-R-directed autoantibodies is age-related. It has to be clarified by larger studies whether NMDA-R autoantibodies in peripheral blood may predispose patients with AD and SIVD to susceptibility for psychotic episodes if disturbances of blood-brain-barrier integrity occur.,0,Seroprevalence of N-methyl-D-aspartate glutamate receptor (NMDA-R) autoantibodies in aging subjects without neuropsychiatric disorders and in dementia patients.N-methyl-D-aspartate glutamate receptors (NMDA-R) play a key role in learning and memory.

4300,Plasma signaling proteins in persons at genetic risk for Alzheimer disease: influence of APOE genotype.,OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of familial Alzheimer disease (FAD) mutations and APOE genotype on plasma signaling protein levels. DESIGN: Cross-sectional comparison of plasma levels of 77 proteins measured using multiplex immune assays. SETTING: A tertiary referral dementia research center. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-three persons from families harboring PSEN1 or APP mutations  aged 19 to 59 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Protein levels were compared between FAD mutation carriers (MCs) and noncarriers (NCs) and among APOE genotype groups  using multiple linear regression models. RESULTS: Twenty-one participants were FAD MCs and 12 were NCs. Six had the APOE EEE2/3  6 had the EEE3/4  and 21 had the EEE3/3 genotype. Levels of 17 proteins differed among APOE genotype groups  and there were significant interactions between age and APOE genotype for 12 proteins. Plasma levels of apolipoprotein E and superoxide dismutase 1 were highest in the EEE2 carriers  lowest in EEE4 carriers  and intermediate in the EEE3 carriers. Levels of multiple interleukins showed the opposite pattern and  among the EEE4 carriers  demonstrated significant negative correlations with age.

38048,Asthma and COVID-19 in children - a systematic review and call for data,"RATIONALE: Whether asthma constitutes a risk factor for COVID-19 is unclear. Here we aimed to assess whether asthma, the most common chronic disease in children, is associated with higher COVID-19 risk or severity in pediatric populations. METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search in three stages: First, we reviewed PubMed, EMBASE and CINAHL for systematic reviews of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 in pediatric populations, and reviewed their primary articles; second, we searched PubMed for studies on COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2 and asthma/wheeze, and evaluated whether the resulting studies included pediatric populations; third, we repeated the second search in BioRxiv.org and MedRxiv.org to find pre-prints that may have information on pediatric asthma. RESULTS: In the first search, eight systematic reviews were found, of which five were done in pediatric populations; none of the 67 primary studies included data on pediatric asthma as a comorbidity for COVID-19. In the second search, we found 34 results in PubMed, of which five reported asthma in adults, but none included data on children. In the third search, 25 pre-prints in MedRxiv included data on asthma, but none on children. We found one report by the U.S. CDC stating that 40/345 (~11.5%) children with data on chronic conditions had ""chronic lung diseases including asthma"", and one from a tertiary hospital in New York that reported asthma in 11/46 (~23.9%) children hospitalized for COVID-19. CONCLUSION: There is scarcely any data on whether childhood asthma (or other pediatric respiratory diseases) constitute risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19 severity.

36856,Triple rule out computed tomography angiography for evaluation of acute chest pain in the emergency department. Is it beneficial,Background: Acute chest pain (ACP) in emergency department represents a health care challenge. Triple-rule-out (TRO) CTA can provide an evaluation of the coronary arteries  aorta  pulmonary arteries  and chest structures in one scan. The aim of our work was to compare the image quality  contrast material and radiation doses of TRO with standard CTA. In addition  to assess the benefit of the TRO CTA on the patient 's management plan. Methods: prospective analysis of 134 TRO CTA data  to assess the presence of coronary artery disease(CAD)  aortic dissection  pulmonary embolism and other chest pathology. Then retrospectively to compare the results with 132 standard CTA. The results: normal coronaries or non significant CAD was seen in 97 (72.9%) patients  19 (14.2%)had moderate or significant CAD  two(1.5%) had aortic dissection  three(2.2 %)had a pulmonary embolism  61% had other findings. The image quality score and noise were comparable between the standard and TRO CTA (2.8±0.6 Vs 2.96 ± 0.6  P =0. 28) and (30.5±10.6 Vs 28.4±1 P=0. 1)Respectively. The effective radiation dose was significantly lower in the standard compared to the TRO CTA using prospective (4.4±1.7 Vs 5.1±0.5 msv  P=0.008) and (11.9 Vs 18.3±5 msv  P=0. 0001) for retrospective gating protocols. The contrast dose was lower with standard protocol (83±5 Vs 102 ±9ml. p=0. 001 ). Conclusions: TRO CTA is a valid tool for diagnosis of CAD and can provide accurate detection of non coronary pathology  but it was associated with higher radiation and contrast doses compared to the standard CTA.

32535,Stimulus pattern dependence of the Alzheimer's disease amyloid-beta 42 peptide's inhibition of long term potentiation in mouse hippocampal slices.,Increasing evidence has pointed to inhibition of Long Term Potentiation (LTP) by soluble A beta 42 oligomers as central in the etiology of the learning and memory deficits that are hallmarks of Alzheimer Disease. These effects are thought to occur by an interaction between A beta 42 and certain cellular effectors that induce LTP  however  the precise identity of the A beta 42-interactive signaling molecules is unknown. Identification of such effectors is made more difficult because LTP induced by different stimulation protocols can be expressed through heterogeneous signaling pathways. The aim of this study was to compare differences in the A beta 42-dependent levels of inhibition of LTPs that were induced using high frequency stimulation (HFS)  versus theta burst stimulation (TBS). Our results show that untreated control brain slices tetanized with either HFS or TBS gave similar levels of LTP and post tetanic stimulation (PTP)  suggesting that the response induced by either protocol was comparable. However  A beta 42 peptide significantly blocked LTP and PTP induced by HFS  but not when TBS was used. NMDA receptor antagonists  D-AP5 and ifenprodil  both blocked LTPs that were induced by HFS or TBS. We propose that unknown signaling effectors  other than the NMDA receptor  which are differentially involved in the induction of LTP by TBS  as compared to HFS  may be responsible for this resistance of TBS-induced LTP to A beta 42 dependent inhibition.,0,Stimulus pattern dependence of the Alzheimer's disease amyloid-beta 42 peptide's inhibition of long term potentiation in mouse hippocampal slices.Increasing evidence has pointed to inhibition of Long Term Potentiation (LTP) by soluble A beta 42 oligomers as central in the etiology of the learning and memory deficits that are hallmarks of Alzheimer Disease.

In this review, we highlight the hospital and cardiac surgical experience at Baylor St. Luke's Medical Center in the Texas Medical Center in Houston, Texas as of mid-July 2020. Our local experience has consisted of a spring surge (early March to early May), followed by a relative flattening and then a summer surge (early June to present day), similar to a sine wave.

32815,COVID-19 Stroke Apical Lung Examination Study: A Diagnostic and Prognostic Imaging Biomarker in Suspected Acute Stroke,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) relies on clinical features and reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction testing, but the sensitivity is limited. Carotid CTA is a routine acute stroke investigation and includes the lung apices. We evaluated CTA as a potential COVID-19 diagnostic imaging biomarker. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a multicenter, retrospective study (n = 225) including CTAs of patients with suspected acute stroke from 3 hyperacute stroke units (March-April 2020). We evaluated the reliability and accuracy of candidate diagnostic imaging biomarkers. Demographics, clinical features, and risk factors for COVID-19 and stroke were analyzed using univariate and multivariate statistics. RESULTS: Apical ground-glass opacification was present in 22.2% (50/225) of patients. Ground-glass opacification had high interrater reliability (Fleiss kappa = 0.81; 95% CI, 0.68-0.95) and, compared with reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, had good diagnostic performance (sensitivity, 75% [95% CI, 56-87]; specificity, 81% [95% CI, 71-88]; OR = 11.65 [95% CI, 4.14-32.78]; P < .001) on multivariate analysis. In contrast, all other contemporaneous demographic, clinical, and imaging features available at CTA were not diagnostic for COVID-19. The presence of apical ground-glass opacification was an independent predictor of increased 30-day mortality (18.0% versus 5.7%, P = .017; hazard ratio = 3.51; 95% CI, 1.42-8.66; P = .006). CONCLUSIONS: We identified a simple, reliable, and accurate COVID-19 diagnostic and prognostic imaging biomarker obtained from CTA lung apices: the presence or absence of ground-glass opacification.

30818,Synergistic induction of ER stress by homocysteine and beta-amyloid in SH-SY5Y cells.,Clinical studies have raised the possibility that elevated plasma levels of homocysteine increase the risk of atherosclerosis  stroke and possibly neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD); however  the direct impact of homocysteine on neuron cells and the mechanism by which it could induce neurodegeneration have yet to be clearly demonstrated. Here  we investigated the effect of homocysteine on endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress  the suggested mechanism of neurotoxicity  in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. The effect of homocysteine on amyloid-beta (Abeta)-induced neurotoxicity and the protective activity of folate were also investigated. Homocysteine led to increased expressions of the binding protein (BiP) and the spliced form of X-box-protein (XBP)-1 mRNAs  suggesting activation of the unfolded-protein response and an increase in apoptosis. When cells were cotreated with homocysteine and Abeta  caspase-3 activity was significantly increased  and expressions of BiP and the spliced form of XBP-1 mRNAs were significantly induced. The neurotoxicity of homocysteine was attenuated by the treatment of cells with folate  as determined by caspase-3 activity and apoptotic body staining. These findings indicate that homocysteine induces ER stress and  ultimately  apoptosis and sensitizes neurons to amyloid toxicity via the synergistic induction of ER stress. Furthermore  a neuroprotective effect of folate against homocysteine-induced toxicity was also observed. Therefore  the findings of our study suggest that ER stress-induced homocysteine toxicity may play an important physiological role in enhancing the pathogenesis of Abeta-induced neuronal degeneration.,0,Synergistic induction of ER stress by homocysteine and beta-amyloid in SH-SY5Y cells.Clinical studies have raised the possibility that elevated plasma levels of homocysteine increase the risk of atherosclerosis  stroke and possibly neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD); however  the direct impact of homocysteine on neuron cells and the mechanism by which it could induce neurodegeneration have yet to be clearly demonstrated.

13175,Contact tracing with digital assistance in Taiwan's COVID-19 outbreak response,"AIM: Comprehensive case investigation and contact tracing are crucial to prevent community spread of COVID-19. We demonstrated a utility of using traditional contact tracing measures supplemented with symptom tracking and contact management system to assist public health workers with high efficiency. METHODS: A centralized contact tracing system was developed to support data linkage, cross-jurisdictional coordination, and follow-up of contacts' health status. We illustrated the process of how digital tools support contact tracing and management of COVID-19 cases and measured the timeliness from case detection to contact monitoring to evaluate system performance. RESULTS: Among the 8,051 close contacts of the 487 confirmed cases (16.5 close contacts/case, 95% CI [13.9-19.1]), the median elapsed time from last exposure to quarantine was three days (IQR 1-5). By implementing the approach of self-reporting using automatic text-messages and web-app, the percentage of health status updates from self-reporting increased from 22.5% to 61.5%. The high proportion of secondary cases detected via contact tracing (88%) might reduce the R0 to under one and minimize the impact of local transmission in the community. CONCLUSION: Comprehensive contact tracing and management with complementary technology would still be a pillar of strategies for containing outbreaks during de-escalation or early in the next wave of COVID-19 pandemic.

4381,Public's Perceptions and Knowledge Towards the 2019 Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19): A Social Media Cross-Sectional Study,"BACKGROUND: Social media represents a rapid and impactful way to obtain and deliver information in the 21st century. OBJECTIVE: The aim was to rapidly obtain information regarding public's perceptions, knowledge and behaviors towards the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), in order to identify key areas of public education. METHODS: In a cross-sectional study design, a survey weblink was posted on the social media platforms: Instagram, Twitter and WhatsApp, by the study investigators. Participants included all users of social media, aged 18-years and above. The main outcomes measured were knowledge of symptoms of COVID-19, protective measures against COVID-19 and source(s) of information about COVID-19. Sub-group analyses were conducted examining effects of age, gender, underlying illness and working/studying in healthcare on likelihood of acquiring COVID-19 and likelihood of vaccinating against COVID-19. RESULTS: A total of 5,677 subjects completed the survey in 1 week. ""Fever or chills"" (87.6%) and ""shortness of breath"" (82.7%) were identified as main symptoms of COVID-19. Washing/sanitizing hands (87.9%) and avoiding public places/crowds (85.7%) were identified as most frequent protective measures against COVID-19. Social media was the most utilized source of COVID-19 information (83.5%), followed by the World Health Organization (50.1%). Subgroup analysis revealed younger subjects (age <35 years), males and those working/studying in healthcare had reported higher perceived likelihood of acquiring COVID-19, whereas older subjects, females and those in non-healthcare areas reported lower perceived likelihood of acquiring COVID-19. Similar trends were observed for vaccination against COVID-19; with older subjects, females and those in non-healthcare areas reporting lower likelihood of vaccinating against COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Our results are indicative of a relatively well-informed cohort, implementing appropriate protective measures. However, key knowledge deficiencies exist with regards to vaccination against COVID-19.

59137,Normative database of the serotonergic system in healthy subjects using multi-tracer PET.,The highly diverse serotonergic system with at least 16 different receptor subtypes is implicated in the pathophysiology of most neuropsychiatric disorders including affective and anxiety disorders  obsessive compulsive disorder  post-traumatic stress disorder  eating disorders  sleep disturbance  attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder  drug addiction  suicidal behavior  schizophrenia  Alzheimer  etc. Alterations of the interplay between various pre- and postsynaptic receptor subtypes might be involved in the pathogenesis of these disorders. However  there is a lack of comprehensive in vivo values using standardized procedures. In the current PET study we quantified 3 receptor subtypes  including the major inhibitory (5-HT(1A) and 5-HT(1B)) and excitatory (5-HT(2A)) receptors  and the transporter (5-HTT) in the brain of healthy human subjects to provide a database of standard values.

A standard template in MNI stereotactic space served for region of interest delineation. This template follows two anatomical parcellation schemes: 1) Brodmann areas including 41 regions and 2) AAL (automated anatomical labeling) including 52 regions. Standard values (mean  SD  and range) for each receptor and region are presented. Mean cortical and subcortical binding potential (BP) values were in good agreement with previously published human in vivo and post-mortem data.

However  patients with these mutations express substantially different clinical phenotypes. Therefore  secondary structure and cytotoxic effects of the three Abeta(12-42) variants [wild-type (WT)  Dutch and Flemish] were tested. At a concentration of 5 microM the aggregation of these peptides followed the order: Abeta(1-42) WT > Abeta(12-42) WT > Abeta(12-42) Flemish > Abeta(12-42) Dutch. The stability of the secondary structure of these peptides upon decreasing the trifluoroethanol (TFE) concentration in the buffer was followed by circular dichroism measurements. WT peptides progressively lost their alpha-helical structure; this change occurred faster for both the Flemish and Dutch peptides  and at higher percentages of TFE in the buffer  and was accompanied by an increase in beta-sheet and random coil content. Apoptosis was induced in neuronal cells by the Abeta(12-42) WT and Flemish peptides at concentrations as low as 1-5 microM  as evidenced by propidium iodide (PI) staining  DNA laddering and caspase-3 activity measurements. Even when longer incubation times and higher peptide concentrations were applied the N-truncated Dutch peptide did not induce apoptosis. Apoptosis induced by the full length Abeta(1-42) peptide was weaker than that induced by its N-truncated variant.

These data suggest that N-truncation enhanced the cytotoxic effects of Abeta WT and Flemish peptides  which may play a role in the accelerated progression of dementia.","{'judgement': 'False', 'index': 853}",0,"{'judgement': 'False', 'index': 853}",0,"{'judgement': 'False', 'index': 853}",0,"{'judgement': 'False', 'index': 853}",0,"{'judgement': 'True', 'probability': '0.85', 'index': 853}",1
44291,Case of colonic intussusception secondary to mobile cecum syndrome repaired by laparoscopic cecopexy using a barbed wound suture device,"A 27-year-old man with recurrent right lower quadrant pain was admitted to our hospital. Ultrasonography and computed tomography examination of the abdomen revealed a target sign in the ascending colon, which was compatible with the diagnosis of cecal intussusception. The intussusception was spontaneously resolved at that time, but it relapsed 6 mo later. The patient underwent a successful colonoscopic disinvagination; there was no evidence of neoplastic or inflammatory lesions in the colon and terminal ileum. The patient underwent laparoscopic surgery for recurring cecal intussusception. During laparoscopy, we observed an unfixed cecum on the posterior peritoneum (i.e. A mobile cecum). Thus, we performed laparoscopic appendectomy and cecopexy with a lateral peritoneal flap using a barbed wound suture device. The patient's post-operative course was uneventful, and he continued to do well without recurrence at 10 mo after surgery. Laparoscopic cecopexy using a barbed wound suture device is a simple and reliable procedure that can be the treatment of choice for recurrent cecal intussusception associated with a mobile cecum.",0,"Case of colonic intussusception secondary to mobile cecum syndrome repaired by laparoscopic cecopexy using a barbed wound suture deviceA 27-year-old man with recurrent right lower quadrant pain was admitted to our hospital.

23719,Subcellular compartment and molecular subdomain of beta-amyloid precursor protein relevant to the Abeta 42-promoting effects of Alzheimer mutant presenilin 2.,Increased production of amyloid beta peptides ending at position 42 (Abeta42) is one of the pathogenic phenotypes caused by mutant forms of presenilins (PS) linked to familial Alzheimer's disease. To identify the subcellular compartment(s) in which familial Alzheimer's disease mutant PS2 (mt PS2) affects the gamma-cleavage of betaAPP to increase Abeta42  we co-expressed the C-terminal 99-amino acid fragment of betaAPP (C100) tagged with sorting signals to the endoplasmic reticulum (C100/ER) or to the trans-Golgi network (C100/TGN) together with mt PS2 in N2a cells. C100/TGN co-transfected with mt PS2 increased levels or ratios of intracellular as well as secreted Abeta42 at similar levels to those with C100 without signals (C100/WT)  whereas C100/ER yielded a negligible level of Abeta  which was not affected by co-transfection of mt PS2. To identify the molecular subdomain of betaAPP required for the effects of mt PS2  we next co-expressed C100 variously truncated at the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain together with mt PS2. All types of C-terminally truncated C100 variants including that lacking the entire cytoplasmic domain yielded the secreted form of Abeta at levels comparable with those from C100/WT  and co-transfection of mt PS2 increased the secretion of Abeta42. These results suggest that (i) late intracellular compartments including TGN are the major sites in which Abeta42 is produced and up-regulated by mt PS2 and that (ii) the anterior half of C100 lacking the entire cytoplasmic domain is sufficient for the overproduction of Abeta42 caused by mt PS2.,0,Subcellular compartment and molecular subdomain of beta-amyloid precursor protein relevant to the Abeta 42-promoting effects of Alzheimer mutant presenilin 2.Increased production of amyloid beta peptides ending at position 42 (Abeta42) is one of the pathogenic phenotypes caused by mutant forms of presenilins (PS) linked to familial Alzheimer's disease.

142,Early Description of Coronavirus 2019 Disease in Kidney Transplant Recipients in New York,"BACKGROUND: The novel SARS-CoV-2 virus has caused a global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Although immunosuppressed individuals are thought to be at an increased risk of severe disease, little is known about their clinical presentation, disease course, or outcomes. METHODS: We report 15 kidney transplant recipients from the Columbia University kidney transplant program who required hospitalization for confirmed COVID-19, and describe their management, clinical course, and outcomes. RESULTS: Patients presented most often with a fever (87%) and/or cough (67%). Initial chest x-ray most commonly showed bilateral infiltrates, but 33% had no acute radiographic findings. Patients were managed with immunosuppression reduction and the addition of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin. Although 27% of our patients needed mechanical ventilation, over half were discharged home by the end of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Kidney transplant recipients with COVID-19 have presentations that are similar to that of the general population.

49918,Signaling events in amyloid beta-peptide-induced neuronal death and insulin-like growth factor I protection.,Amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) is implicated as the toxic agent in Alzheimer's disease and is the major component of brain amyloid plaques. In vitro  Abeta causes cell death  but the molecular mechanisms are unclear. We analyzed the early signaling mechanisms involved in Abeta toxicity using the SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell line. Abeta caused cell death and induced a 2- to 3-fold activation of JNK. JNK activation and cell death were inhibited by overexpression of a dominant-negative SEK1 (SEK1-AL) construct. Butyrolactone I  a cdk5 inhibitor  had an additional protective effect against Abeta toxicity in these SEK1-AL-expressing cells suggesting that cdk5 and JNK activation independently contributed to this toxicity. Abeta also weakly activated ERK and Akt but had no effect on p38 kinase. Inhibitors of ERK and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways did not affect Abeta-induced cell death  suggesting that these pathways were not important in Abeta toxicity. Insulin-like growth factor I protected against Abeta toxicity by strongly activating ERK and Akt and blocking JNK activation in a PI3K-dependent manner. Pertussis toxin also blocked Abeta-induced cell death and JNK activation suggesting that G(i/o) proteins were upstream activators of JNK. The results suggest that activation of the JNK pathway and cdk5 may be initial signaling cascades in Abeta-induced cell death.,0,Signaling events in amyloid beta-peptide-induced neuronal death and insulin-like growth factor I protection.Amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) is implicated as the toxic agent in Alzheimer's disease and is the major component of brain amyloid plaques.

16961,Surgical Education in the Time of COVID: Understanding the Early Response of Surgical Training Programs to the Novel Coronavirus Pandemic,"Objective: Describe the early impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on general surgery residency training nationwide. Design(s): A 31-question electronic survey was distributed to general surgery program directors. Qualitative data underwent iterative coding analysis. Quantitative data were evaluated with summary statistics and bivariate analyses. Participant(s): Eighty-four residency programs (33.6% response rate) with representation across US geographic regions, program affiliations, and sizes. Result(s): Widespread changes were observed in the surgical training environment. One hundred percent of programs reduced the number of residents on rounds and 95.2% reduced the size of their in-hospital resident workforce; on average, daytime staffing decreased by nearly half. With telehealth clinics (90.5%) and remote inpatient consults (26.2%), both clinical care and resident didactics (86.9%) were increasingly virtual, with similar impact across all program demographics. Conversely, availability of some wellness initiatives was significantly higher among university programs than independent programs, including childcare (51.2% vs 6.7%), housing (41.9% vs 13.3%), and virtual mental health services (83.7% vs 53.3%). Conclusion(s): Changes in clinical care delivery dramatically reduced in face-to-face learning opportunities for surgical trainees during the COVID-19 pandemic. While this effect had equal impact across all program types, sizes, and geographies, the same cannot be said for wellness initiatives. Though all programs initiated some strategies to protect resident health, the disparity between university programs and independent programs may be cause for action.Copyright ÁE© 2020 Association of Program Directors in Surgery",0,"Surgical Education in the Time of COVID: Understanding the Early Response of Surgical Training Programs to the Novel Coronavirus PandemicObjective: Describe the early impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on general surgery residency training nationwide.

33592,Longitudinal progression of Alzheimer's-like patterns of atrophy in normal older adults: the SPARE-AD index.,A challenge in developing informative neuroimaging biomarkers for early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease is the need to identify biomarkers that are evident before the onset of clinical symptoms  and which have sufficient sensitivity and specificity on an individual patient basis. Recent literature suggests that spatial patterns of brain atrophy discriminate amongst Alzheimer's disease  mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and cognitively normal (CN) older adults with high accuracy on an individual basis  thereby offering promise that subtle brain changes can be detected during prodromal Alzheimer's disease stages. Here  we investigate whether these spatial patterns of brain atrophy can be detected in CN and MCI individuals and whether they are associated with cognitive decline. Images from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) were used to construct a pattern classifier that recognizes spatial patterns of brain atrophy which best distinguish Alzheimer's disease patients from CN on an individual person basis. This classifier was subsequently applied to longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging scans of CN and MCI participants in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) neuroimaging study. The degree to which Alzheimer's disease-like patterns were present in CN and MCI subjects was evaluated longitudinally in relation to cognitive performance. The oldest BLSA CN individuals showed progressively increasing Alzheimer's disease-like patterns of atrophy  and individuals with these patterns had reduced cognitive performance. MCI was associated with steeper longitudinal increases of Alzheimer's disease-like patterns of atrophy  which separated them from CN (receiver operating characteristic area under the curve equal to 0.89). Our results suggest that imaging-based spatial patterns of brain atrophy of Alzheimer's disease  evaluated with sophisticated pattern analysis and recognition methods  may be useful in discriminating among CN individuals who are likely to be stable versus those who will show cognitive decline. Future prospective studies will elucidate the temporal dynamics of spatial atrophy patterns and the emergence of clinical symptoms.,0,Longitudinal progression of Alzheimer's-like patterns of atrophy in normal older adults: the SPARE-AD index.A challenge in developing informative neuroimaging biomarkers for early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease is the need to identify biomarkers that are evident before the onset of clinical symptoms  and which have sufficient sensitivity and specificity on an individual patient basis.

48571,Aortic aneurysms in systemic lupus erythematosus: a meta-analysis of 35 cases in the literature and two different pathogeneses,BACKGROUND: Aortic aneurysms including dissection are uncommon complications of systemic lupus erythematosus  but the incidence has been increasing with an improved prognosis for this disease. However  the mechanisms contributing to aneurysm formation in systemic lupus erythematosus have not been fully clarified. METHODS: A meta-analysis of published cases was conducted to clarify the patient characteristics that may contribute to aneurysm formation in systemic lupus erythematosus. A search of relevant studies published over the past 40 years (1969-2008) was carried out in the publications on aortic aneurysms with systemic lupus erythematosus  and 35 cases were identified. The contributing factors to aneurysm formation as well as the patient prognosis were searched for sex  age  duration of corticosteroid treatment  aneurysm site (thoracic and/or abdominal)  mortality  evidence of atherosclerotic involvement  and presence or absence of an operation  rupture  dissection  cystic medial degeneration  vasculitis  and hypertension. Each of these factors was assigned to each point score. Based on the point scores  a statistical analysis of rank correlation was thereafter performed. RESULTS: The factors correlating with the presence of thoracic or abdominal lesions differed significantly. The presence of thoracic aneurysms correlated with dissection and cystic medial degeneration  whereas abdominal lesions correlated with the finding of atherosclerosis. Thoracic lesions showed a high rate of death  while abdominal lesions were associated with a relatively favorable prognosis. Abdominal lesions were related to the duration of steroid therapy. The other correlations among the various factors were also evaluated  with the finding of cystic medial degeneration associated with vasculitis. CONCLUSION: Two principal patterns emerged from this analysis. One was the fatal nonatherosclerotic thoracic aneurysm which was associated with cystic medial degeneration and probably due to vasculitis. The other was atherosclerotic abdominal aneurysm which was complicated by long-term steroid treatment and it showed a relatively favorable prognosis.,0,Aortic aneurysms in systemic lupus erythematosus: a meta-analysis of 35 cases in the literature and two different pathogenesesBACKGROUND: Aortic aneurysms including dissection are uncommon complications of systemic lupus erythematosus  but the incidence has been increasing with an improved prognosis for this disease.

Thoracic lesions showed a high rate of death  while abdominal lesions were associated with a relatively favorable prognosis. Abdominal lesions were related to the duration of steroid therapy. The other correlations among the various factors were also evaluated  with the finding of cystic medial degeneration associated with vasculitis. CONCLUSION: Two principal patterns emerged from this analysis. One was the fatal nonatherosclerotic thoracic aneurysm which was associated with cystic medial degeneration and probably due to vasculitis. The other was atherosclerotic abdominal aneurysm which was complicated by long-term steroid treatment and it showed a relatively favorable prognosis.,"{'judgement': 'False', 'index': 867}",0,"{'judgement': 'False', 'index': 867}",0,"{'judgement': 'False', 'index': 867}",0,"{'judgement': 'False', 'index': 867}",0,"{'judgement': 'True', 'probability': '0.8', 'index': 867}",1
37207,NINDS AIREN neuroimaging criteria do not distinguish stroke patients with and without dementia.,OBJECTIVE: To determine the utility of the neuroimaging component within the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) Association Internationale pour la Recherche et l'Enseignement en Neurosciences (AIREN) criteria for vascular dementia for distinguishing between patients with and without dementia in the context of cerebrovascular disease. METHOD: One hundred twenty-five poststroke patients age > or =75 (27 with and 98 without poststroke dementia) from representative hospital-based stroke registers in the North East of England were evaluated using a 1.5 T MR scanner. The proportion of patients with and without poststroke dementia meeting the imaging component of the NINDS AIREN criteria was determined  and hippocampal atrophy (measured using the Schelten scale) was compared between the two groups. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the patients with and without poststroke dementia on any criteria of the imaging parameters within the NINDS AIREN criteria. In addition  there were no significant differences in the number or size of cortical or subcortical infarcts between the two groups  with 13 patients without dementia having cortical infarcts >50 mm. Patients with dementia had greater hippocampal atrophy (right: Mann-Whitney U test  Z = 2.5  p = 0.01; left: Mann-Whitney U test  Z = 2.5  p = 0.01).

27215,Healthcare professionals' perceptions of critical care resource availability and factors associated with mental well-being during COVID-19: Results from a US survey,"BACKGROUND: Assessing the impact of COVID-19 on intensive care unit (ICU) providers' perceptions of resource availability and evaluating factors associated with emotional distress/burnout can inform interventions to promote provider well-being. METHODS: Between April 23-May 7, 2020, we electronically administered a survey to physicians, nurses, respiratory therapist (RTs) and advanced practice providers (APPs) caring for COVID-19 patients in the US. We conducted multivariate regression to assess associations between concerns, reported lack of resources and three outcomes: emotional distress/burnout (primary outcome), and two secondary outcomes: 1) fear that hospital is unable to keep providers safe, and 2) concern about transmitting COVID-19 to family/community. RESULTS: We included 1,651 respondents from all 50 states; 47% nurses, 25% physicians, 17% RTs, 11% APPS. Shortages of intensivists and ICU nurses were reported by 12% and 28% of providers, respectively. The largest supply restrictions reported were for powered air purifying respirators (PAPRs); (56% reporting restricted availability). Provider concerns included worries about transmitting COVID-19 to family/community (66%), emotional distress/burnout (58%), and insufficient personal protective equipment (PPE) (40%). After adjustment, emotional distress/burnout was significantly associated with insufficient PPE access (aRR: 1.43, 95% CI: 1.32 - 1.55), stigma from community (aRR: 1.32, 95% CI: 1.24 - 1.41), and poor communication with supervisors (aRR:1.13, 95% CI: 1.06 - 1.21). Insufficient PPE access was the strongest predictor of feeling that the hospital is unable to keep providers safe and worries about transmitting infection to families/communities. CONCLUSION: Addressing insufficient PPE access, poor communication from supervisors, and community stigma may improve provider mental well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic.

56947,Anatomy of the episodic buffer: a voxel-based morphometry study in patients with dementia.,"In 2000 Baddeley proposed the existence of a new component of working memory  the episodic buffer  which should contribute to the on-line maintenance of integrated memory traces. The author assumed that this component should be critical for immediate recall of a short story that exceeds the capacity of the phonological store. Accordingly  patients with Alzheimer's dementia (AD) should suffer of a deficit of the episodic buffer when immediate recall of a short story is impossible. On the other hand  the episodic buffer should be somewhat preserved in such patients when some IR can occur (Baddeley and Wilson  2002). We adopted this logic for a voxel-based morphometry study. We compared the distribution of grey-matter density of two such groups of AD patients with and of a group of age-matched controls. We found that both AD groups had a significant atrophy of the left mid-hippocampus; on the other hand  the anterior part of the hippocampus was significantly more atrophic in patients who were also impaired on the immediate prose recall task. Six out of ten patients with no immediate recall were spared at ""central executive"" tasks. Taken together our findings suggest that the left anterior hippocampus contributes to the episodic buffer of the revised working memory model.

50378,COVID-19-Related Information Sources and the Relationship With Confidence in People Coping with COVID-19: Facebook Survey Study in Taiwan,"BACKGROUND: People obtain information on the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) from the internet and other sources. Understanding the factors related to such information sources aids health professionals in educating individuals. OBJECTIVE: This study used data collected from the online survey study on COVID-19 in Taiwan to examine what major COVID-19 information sources are available and which sources are significantly related to the self-confidence of people in coping with COVID-19 in Taiwan. METHODS: A total of 1904 participants (1270 non-health-care workers and 634 health care workers) were recruited from the Facebook advertisement. Their major sources of information about COVID-19, the relationships between the sources and demographic factors, and the relationships between the sources and the self-confidence in coping with COVID-19 were surveyed. RESULTS: Most Taiwanese people relied on the internet for COVID-19 information. Many respondents also used a variety of sources of information on COVID-19; such variety was associated with sex, age, and the level of worry toward COVID-19, as well as if one was a health care worker. For health care workers, the use of formal lessons as an information source was significantly associated with better self-confidence in coping with COVID-19. The significant association between receiving information from more sources and greater self-confidence was found only in health care workers but not in non-health-care workers. CONCLUSIONS: Medical professionals should consider subgroups of the population when establishing various means to deliver information on COVID-19.

METHODS: Fifty-five subjects (19 normal older controls  NC  and 36 with mild cognitive impairment  MCI) underwent clinical assessments and dynamic PiB positron emission tomography imaging. RESULTS: A linear multiple regression model showed that greater IADL impairment was associated with greater global PiB retention in all subjects (R(2) = 0.40; unstandardized partial regression coefficient  EEE = 5.8; p = 0.0002) and in MCI subjects only (R(2) = 0.28; EEE = 6.1; p = 0.003)  but not in NC subjects only.

24524,Pathological determinants of the transition to clinical dementia in Alzheimer's disease.,"The authors developed multivariate models to examine the association between Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scale scores and the spatial distribution of paired helical filament tau (PHF-tau) pathology. Severity of tauopathy was examined in 14 cortical regions of interest (ROIs). Classification trees were used to test the independent hierarchical contributions of each ROI to dementia. Multiple-regression and cluster analyses were performed to determine the relative contributions of select ROIs to dementia. Dementia (CDR > or = 1) was modeled as a dichotomous variable. Autopsy material was obtained from 124 demented and nondemented elderly patients. All ROIs except the hippocampus made significant contributions to dementia. However  they were not independent. In multivariate models  only a single step (Step 7 in a hierarchical progression)  which contained four ROIs  contributed significantly to dementia. A classification tree resulted in a single decision split  suggesting that only Step 7 ROIs need be considered. A total of 89.4% of the cases were correctly classified (p < .0001). Twelve discrepant cases all had superimposed vasculopathy that might also have affected the function of Step 7 ROIs. The transition to clinical dementia was associated with the presence of tauopathy in A9/10  A22  A23  and A39. Animal studies suggest that these represent a single distributed cortical network focusing on prefrontal regions that provide ""executive control"" over complex goal-directed behaviors.

60012,Chronic kidney disease and acute kidney injury in the COVID-19 Spanish outbreak,"BACKGROUND: Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan and rapidly spread, affecting >10 million cases worldwide. Caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and primarily manifesting as an acute respiratory failure with interstitial and alveolar pneumonia, it can also affect multiple organs. Kidney involvement was underestimated in early reports and its role remains controversial. The aim of this study was to analyse the role of kidney damage in COVID-19 outcome. METHODS: This is a prospective cohort study of 1603 consecutive patients admitted in a University Reference Hospital in the heart of the European outbreak. RESULTS: Median age was 64 years, 40.4% were female, 15.2% presented diabetes mellitus, 35.7% hypertension and 20.3% obesity. On admission, the prevalence of elevated serum creatinine (sCr), proteinuria, leucocyturia and haematuria were 21.0, 37.8, 31.8 and 45.6%, respectively. In total, 43.5% of those with an elevated sCr had previous chronic kidney disease (CKD) and 11.4% of those with normal sCr developed an in-hospital acute kidney injury (AKI); 17 patients needed acute haemodialysis; and 197 patients died during hospitalization. Cox proportional hazard regression confirmed that elevated baseline sCr [hazard ratio (95% confidence interval) 2.40 (1.79-3.22)], previous CKD [1.59 (1.06-2.37)], haematuria [1 + 1.68 (0.92-3.06), 2-3 + 2.69 (1.49-4.87)] and in-hospital AKI [1.50 (0.92-2.44)] were independent risk factors for in-hospital death after adjusting for age, sex and comorbidity. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of acute and chronic kidney disease on admission and in-hospital AKI is higher than previously reported in Wuhan, and is associated with high in-hospital mortality.

The meta-analysis shows that there are differences in symptoms and other characteristics reported by the patients of COVID-19 inside and outside China. Patients in China have a higher proportion of fever, cough, and shortness of breath as compared to patients outside of China. However, we found the opposite results for the gastrointestinal symptoms such as Diarrhea. Patients outside of China have a significantly higher proportion of Diarrhea as compared to patients within China. We also observed gender disparity among our studies, with the male population being more susceptible than the female population. Moreover, the analysis suggests that the fatality rate in China is relatively lower as compared to the fatality rate in other countries.

30129,An early specific cell-cell interaction occurs in the production of beta-amyloid in cell cultures.,We have earlier proposed that a cell-cell interaction  mediated by the specific binding of molecules of the beta-amyloid precursor protein (beta-APP) on one cell surface with molecules of presenilin (PS) on the other cell surface  is a required initial step in the ultimate production of beta-amyloid (Abeta) from beta-APP. Abeta is widely believed to be the neurotoxic agent in Alzheimer's disease. In this paper  we test this proposal by modifying cells to express surface beta-APP but no PS  and other cells to express surface PS but no beta-APP. Coculturing these two cell populations at appropriate cell densities produces substantial amounts of Abeta that appear both in cell extracts and culture media. Such Abeta production could occur only if the two cell types interacted with one another to provide the beta-APP and the PS required for the generation of Abeta. The addition to the coculture  from the start  of the soluble specific N-terminal domain of the appropriate PS significantly reduces the amount of Abeta produced. These and related experiments  therefore  suggest a very different mechanism for Abeta production than the one that is currently widely accepted.,0,An early specific cell-cell interaction occurs in the production of beta-amyloid in cell cultures.We have earlier proposed that a cell-cell interaction  mediated by the specific binding of molecules of the beta-amyloid precursor protein (beta-APP) on one cell surface with molecules of presenilin (PS) on the other cell surface  is a required initial step in the ultimate production of beta-amyloid (Abeta) from beta-APP.

11236,Applying Telehealth Technologies and Strategies to Provide Acute Care Consultation and Treatment of Patients with Confirmed or Possible COVID-19,"Background and Purpose: The COVID-19 pandemic continues to grow, with 19% of total confirmed patients classified as severe or critical experiencing complications such as dyspnea, hypoxia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, or multiorgan failure. These complications require rehabilitative care. Considering the contagious nature of COVID-19 and the necessity to decrease the volume of health care professionals entering confirmed COVID-19 patient rooms and becoming a potential disease vector, can audiovisual technologies employed by telehealth and telerehabilitation help? Case Description: This case discusses the Baylor Scott and White Institute for Rehab (BSWIR) Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (PMR) department COVID-19 acute care therapy team's creation of a telehealth strategy to provide early rehabilitative intervention without increasing the odds of disease transmission. Outcome(s): The COVID-19 therapy team created a simple process for identifying and triaging care for patients with possible or confirmed COVID-19. These patients were evaluated and treated by the dedicated team using telehealth strategies. A structured risk-benefit analysis was used to determine when in-room care was indicated. Discussion(s): Acute care physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech-language pathology telehealth strategies can add value by mitigating COVID-19-related harm and influencing recovery, while not unnecessarily becoming additional disease vectors consuming personal protective equipment. COVID-19 is not only an aggressive respiratory illness similar to acute respiratory distress syndrome but also highly contagious and a risk for health care providers. Telehealth strategies allow therapists to intervene early, opening the possibility to maximize recovery and prevent harm or decompensation. Telehealth strategies can be more prevention-focused while the patient is experiencing relatively good health with goals to maximize strength and endurance before the disease process evolves to critical illness. As COVID-19 progresses, therapy can help mitigate potential complications associated with prolonged intensive care unit stay and ventilator management.Copyright ÁE© 2020 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Both viruses have similar transmission characteristics and common clinical manifestations. Influenza has been described to cause respiratory infection with some other respiratory pathogens. However the information of COVID-19 and influenza co-infection is limited. In this study, we reported our co-infected cases and reviewed the literature. We included all COVID-19 diagnosed patients. All patients with a presumed diagnosis of COVID-19 were routinely screened for influenza. Their thorax radiology was reviewed for COVID-19 -influenza differentiation. During the study period, 1103 patients have been diagnosed COVID-19. Among them, 6 patients (0.54%) were diagnosed co-infected with influenza. There have been 28 more co-infected patients reported. Laboratory-based, screening studies reported more patients. Thorax radiology findings were compatible with COVID-19 in 5 and with influenza in 1 one of our patients. Our cases were mild-to-moderate in severity. The reported cases in the literature included patients died (n=2) and those living ventilator dependent or under mechanical ventilation. COVID-19 and influenza co-infection is rare. Screening studies report more cases, suggesting that unless screening COVID-19 patients, the co-infection remains undiagnosed and underestimated. Increasing experience in thoracic radiology may contribute to diagnose the responsible virus(es) from the clinical illness.

Developmental origins of neurocognitive late-life functions are acknowledged  but detailed longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging studies of brain maturation and direct comparisons with aging are lacking. To these aims  a novel method was used to measure longitudinal volume changes in development (n=85  8-22 years) and aging (n=142  60-91 years). Developmental reductions exceeded 1% annually in much of the cortex  more than double to that seen in aging  with a posterior-to-anterior gradient. Cortical reductions were greater than the subcortical during development  while the opposite held in aging. The pattern of lateral cortical changes was similar across development and aging  but the pronounced medial temporal reduction in aging was not precast in development. Converging patterns of change in adolescents and elderly  particularly in the medial prefrontal areas  suggest that late developed cortices are especially vulnerable to atrophy in aging. A key question in future research will be to disentangle the neurobiological underpinnings for the differences and the similarities between brain changes in development and aging.,0,Brain development and aging: overlapping and unique patterns of change.Early-life development is characterized by dramatic changes  impacting lifespan function more than changes in any other period.

The lag-time for developing vaccines means it is of paramount importance to be able to quickly develop and repurpose therapeutic drugs. Protein-based biosensors allow screening to be performed using routine molecular laboratory equipment without a need for expensive chemical reagents. Here we present a biosensor for the 3-chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease from SARS-CoV-2, comprising a FRET-capable pair of fluorescent proteins held in proximity by a protease cleavable linker. We demonstrate the utility of this biosensor for inhibitor discovery by screening 1280 compounds from the Library of Pharmaceutically Active Compounds collection. The screening identified 65 inhibitors, with the 20 most active exhibiting sub-micromolar inhibition of 3CLpro in follow-up EC50 assays.

N-terminal antibodies did not detect intracellular Abeta. Abeta40 antibodies did not detect significant intracellular Abeta  but older cases showed Abeta40 IR in mature plaques. In contrast  Abeta42 antibodies revealed clear-cut intraneuronal IR. All Abeta42 antibodies tested showed strong intraneuronal Abeta42 IR in very young DS patients  especially in theyoungest cases studied (e.g.  3 or 4yr. old)  but this IR declined as extracellular Abeta plaques gradually accumulated and matured. No inflammatory changes were associated with intraneuronal Abeta. We also studied the temporal development of gliosis and NFT formation  revealing that in DS temporal cortex  inflammation and NFT follow Abeta deposition. We conclude that Abeta42 accumulates intracellularly prior to extracellular Abeta deposition in Down syndrome  and that subsequent maturation of extracellular Abeta deposits elicits inflammatory responses andprecedes NFTs.,0,Intraneuronal Abeta42 accumulation in Down syndrome brain.Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains display A beta (Abeta) plaques  inflammatory changes and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs).

59315,Dynamics identification and forecasting of COVID-19 by switching Kalman filters,"The COVID-19 pandemic has captivated scientific activity since its early days. Particular attention has been dedicated to the identification of underlying dynamics and prediction of future trend. In this work, a switching Kalman filter formalism is applied on dynamics learning and forecasting of the daily new cases of COVID-19. The main feature of this dynamical system is its ability to switch between different linear Gaussian models based on the observations and specified probabilities of transitions between these models. It is thus able to handle the problem of hidden state estimation and forecasting for models with non-Gaussian and nonlinear effects. The potential of this method is explored on the daily new cases of COVID-19 both at the state-level and the country-level in the US. The results suggest a common disease dynamics across states that share certain features. We also demonstrate the ability to make short to medium term predictions with quantifiable error bounds.

Of these receptors  the alpha7 nAChRs  which are abundant on hippocampal interneurons  have been implicated in the cytotoxic role of the beta-amyloid. Increased mRNA levels of alpha7 nAChR in the peripheral lymphocytes and hippocampus of AD patients have been reported. We tested the hypothesis that the allelic variant  2bp deletion  of the partially duplicated alpha7 nAChR gene confers susceptibility to Alzheimer's disease. The -2bp polymorphism was examined in 120 patients with AD and 98 normal controls. The distribution of the partially duplicated alpha7 nAChR genotypes (p = 0.372) and alleles (p = 0.465) did not differ significantly for AD patients and controls. This negative finding suggests that the partially duplicated alpha7 nAChR genetic polymorphism contributes no major effect to the development of AD.

17768,Longitudinal multimodal imaging in mild to moderate Alzheimer disease: a pilot study with memantine.,OBJECTIVE: To study the feasibility of multimodal neuroimaging in mild to moderate Alzheimer disease (AD) and to estimate the size of possible treatment effects of memantine on potential functional  structural and metabolic biomarkers of disease progression. METHODS: In this randomised  double-blind  placebo-controlled pilot study  36 patients with moderate AD received 52 weeks of memantine (20 mg/day) or placebo. Patients were re-evaluated after 26 and 52 weeks to measure the change from baseline in several outcome measures including global and regional glucose metabolism  total brain and hippocampal volumes  as well as chemical shift imaging-derived global and regional N-acetylaspartate and myoinositol concentrations. RESULTS: In the total population  global glucose metabolism decreased by 2.3% (p<0.01)  total brain volume by 2.1% (p<0.001) and hippocampal volume by 2.7% (p<0.01) after 52 weeks. Chemical shift imaging (CSI) spectra were severely affected by patient-induced artefacts and highly variable. Patients receiving memantine showed less decline in glucose metabolism in all brain areas than patients on placebo. Their loss of hippocampal volume was substantially smaller (2.4% vs 4.0%). No between-group differences were seen for changes in total brain volume. CONCLUSIONS: The results support the use of multimodal imaging including MRI and positron emission tomography (PET) to monitor the progression of moderate AD. CSI yielded unreliable longitudinal results.

These data suggest that the first proline of the PALP motif plays a crucial role in the stabilization and formation of the high molecular weight complex of PS  the latter being the active form with intramembrane proteolytic activities.","{'judgement': 'False', 'index': 889}",0,"{'judgement': 'False', 'index': 889}",0,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 889}",1,"{'judgement': 'False', 'index': 889}",0,"{'judgement': 'False', 'index': 889}",0
15446,Regional cerebral blood flow abnormalities associated with apathy and depression in Alzheimer disease.,The aim of this study was to identify brain areas related to apathy or depression in patients with Alzheimer disease (AD). Eighty-one AD patients were enrolled in this prospective study. (99m)Tc-HMPAO single photon emission computed tomography was performed to evaluate regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF). According to the Neuropsychiatric Inventory subscores of apathy and depression  9 patients were classified as clinically significant (cs) depressed and non-cs-apathetic (D+) groups and 9 were classified as cs-apathetic and non-cs-depressed (A+) groups. In addition  18 patients were classified as age-matched and Mini-Mental State Examination-matched disease control groups (D-  A-). The significance of rCBF differences between groups and the correlation between rCBF and subscores in 81 AD patients were estimated by SPM (uncorrected P < 0.005) analysis. D+ patients had significantly lower perfusion in the right orbitofrontal and inferior frontal gyri than D- patients  whereas A+ patients had this in the right amygdala  temporal  posterior cingulate  right superior frontal  postcentral  and left superior temporal gyri than A- patients. The negatively correlated areas with depression subscores included the left inferior frontal and the right middle frontal gyri and those with apathy subscores included the right temporal and right medial frontal gyri. We suggest that this finding may indicate that apathy and depression in AD patients involve distinct functional circuits.,0,Regional cerebral blood flow abnormalities associated with apathy and depression in Alzheimer disease.The aim of this study was to identify brain areas related to apathy or depression in patients with Alzheimer disease (AD).

34477,X11 alpha and x11 beta interact with presenilin-1 via their PDZ domains.,X11 alpha and X11 beta are two neuronal adaptor proteins that interact with the Alzheimer's disease amyloid precursor protein (APP). X11 alpha and X11 beta stabilise APP and inhibit production of proteolytic APP fragments including the A beta peptide that is deposited in the brains of Alzheimer's disease patients. The mechanisms by which X11 alpha and X11 beta modulate APP processing are not clear but one possibility is that they influence the activity of the secretases that cleave APP to give rise to A beta. Presenilin-1 is required for gamma-secretase activity and here we demonstrate that both X11 alpha and X11 beta interact with presenilin-1. X11/presenilin-1 binding is via two X11 PDZ domains and sequences within the carboxy-terminus of presenilin-1. We also demonstrate that both X11 alpha and X11 beta mediate the formation of complexes between APP and presenilin-1. These results suggest that the X11 regulation of APP processing is controlled  at least in part  via their interactions with APP and presenilin-1.,0,X11 alpha and x11 beta interact with presenilin-1 via their PDZ domains.X11 alpha and X11 beta are two neuronal adaptor proteins that interact with the Alzheimer's disease amyloid precursor protein (APP).

39241,Pediatric bone scintigraphy update,Bone scintigraphy is a sensitive tool to evaluate the musculoskeletal system in children. Hybrid imaging using computed tomography (CT) in combination with conventional bone scan and single photon emission computed tomography improves specificity and diagnostic accuracy.

We have found this technique to be particularly helpful in localizing a cause for pain in children who are nonverbal and to better delineate small bone and soft-tissue lesions that can occur with diagnoses of trauma  infection  and tumor. Special attention to technique of positioning the patient for potential CT examination is an adaptation that must be made by the technologist.

24949,Biophysical characterization of Abeta42 C-terminal fragments: inhibitors of Abeta42 neurotoxicity.,A key event in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is age-dependent  brain accumulation of amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) leading to Abeta self-association into neurotoxic oligomers. Previously  we showed that Abeta oligomerization and neurotoxicity could be inhibited by C-terminal fragments (CTFs) of Abeta42. Because these CTFs are highly hydrophobic  we asked if they themselves aggregated and  if so  what parameters regulated their aggregation. To answer these questions  we investigated the dependence of CTF aqueous solubility  aggregation kinetics  and morphology on peptide length and sequence and the correlation between these characteristics and inhibition of Abeta42-induced toxicity. We found that CTFs up to 8 residues long were soluble at concentrations >100 microM and had a low propensity to aggregate. Longer CTFs were soluble at approximately 1-80 microM  and most  but not all  readily formed beta-sheet-rich fibrils. Comparison to Abeta40-derived CTFs showed that the C-terminal dipeptide I41-A42 strongly promoted aggregation. Aggregation propensity correlated with the previously reported tendency to form beta-hairpin conformation but not with inhibition of Abeta42-induced neurotoxicity. The data enhance our understanding of the physical characteristics that affect CTF activity and advance our ability to design  synthesize  and test future generations of inhibitors.,0,Biophysical characterization of Abeta42 C-terminal fragments: inhibitors of Abeta42 neurotoxicity.A key event in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is age-dependent  brain accumulation of amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) leading to Abeta self-association into neurotoxic oligomers.

28857,Infliximab efficacy for stricturing pediatric crohn's disease,"Objectives and Study: Infliximab is nowadays among the top-choice treatments for paediatric Crohn's disease (CD) within its different phenotypes [1,2]. Though a risk of bowel stenosis caused by anti-TNFa was initially feared, recent studies have validated Infliximab efficacy as anti-stenosing agent [3]. Aim: evaluation of Infliximab effect on the evolution of pediatric stricturing CD. Methods: Retrospective and prospective descriptive analyses were made of data obtained from paediatric patients treated at the Pediatric Department of Padova University since the year 2000. All patients underwent upper and lower intestinal endoscopy, abdominal ultrasonography (US Technos Esaote, probe LA 523 13 Mhz) and magnetic resonance enterography (MR Philips Achieva 1.5 Tesla) to depict signs of active inflammation as well as complications such as bowel obstruction, fistulas and abscesses. In particular MR is able to distinguish active inflammation (mural post contrast hyperenhancement) from fibrostenotic stricture (low signal intensity wall thickening). Infliximab administration was performed according to the scheduled protocol (5 mg/Kg at week 0-2-6, then each 8 weeks). Results: Among 40 patients, 18 were treated with Infliximab. Five of these Infliximab-treated patients (2 males; median age 10 ys) presented a luminal stenosis (3 ileal, one pre-pyloric, one large-bowel and one anorectal; mean time since CD diagnosis: 26 months, range '1-72'). At the time of stenosis finding, all patients presented a severe disease activity (PCDAI >20). One child with persistent disease activity developed ileal fibrotic stenosis (MR) after 6 Infliximab infusions: a surgical resection was required and Infliximab therapy was discontinued. The other 4 patients, with inflammatory stenosis (US and MR), all started Infliximab therapy and showed disappearance of the initially identified stenosing tract (mean follow-up: 12 months). Conclusion: Our data-though limited - support Infliximab efficacy on pediatric CD, also as regards the stricturing phenotype. It is crucial for diagnosis and follow-up the use of adequate techniques to evidence the inflammatory component of the stenosing tract.

9206,Performance evaluation and clinical application of three antibody test kits for novel coronavirus. [Chinese],"Objective: To evaluate the performance of three antibody kits for novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and to investigate the feasibility and advantages of them in clinical application. Method(s): A total of 104 patients who were admitted to Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital with COVID-19 from January to February 2020 were selected as research group. Fifty-one healthy subjects were selected during the same period as negative control group. Serum antibodies (IgM/IgG) against SARS-CoV-2 were detected using two kinds of colloidal gold kits (A and B kits) and one chemiluminescence kit (C kit). The positive rates of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid in different samples from patients with COVID-19 were retrospectively analyzed. Result(s): The clinical sensitivity of A kit to detect SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM and IgG was 77.88% (81/104) and 65.38% (68/104), respectively, and the clinical specificity was 70.59% (36/51) and 100.00% (51/51). However, the false positive rate in IgM detection was as high as 29.41% (15/51). The sensitivity of B kit to test total antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 was 63.46% (66/104), and the clinical specificity was 94.12% (48/51). The clinical sensitivity of C kit to detect SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM and IgG were respectively 31.73% (33/104) and 64.42% (67/104), and the clinical specificity were both 98.04% (50/51). There was a moderate correlation between the detection results of two colloidal gold kits and the chemiluminescence kit with the Kappa values of 0.462 and 0.587 (Z=6.157, P<0.01; Z=7.345, P<0.01). C kit had the highest positive detection rate for IgG, and would be more reliable to be used for IgG detection in COVID-19 patients 14 d after onset. The total positive detection rate of nucleic acid in all types of samples was 63.46% (66/104). The highest positive detection rate was in throat swabs or sputum samples, followed by those in blood samples and anal swabs. No viral nucleic acid was detected in urine samples for the time being. Conclusion(s): SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies could be detected in the early or late stage of COVID-19. The method of antibody detection has the advantages of shorter detection time, simple operation and high biological safety, indicating that it could be used as a supplementary or auxiliary detection for the diagnosis of suspected COVID-19 cases with negative nucleic acid test results.

65681,Fibrinogen and beta-amyloid association alters thrombosis and fibrinolysis: a possible contributing factor to Alzheimer's disease.,Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder in which vascular pathology plays an important role. Since the beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) is a critical factor in this disease  we examined its relationship to fibrin clot formation in AD. In vitro and in vivo experiments showed that fibrin clots formed in the presence of Abeta are structurally abnormal and resistant to degradation. Fibrin(ogen) was observed in blood vessels positive for amyloid in mouse and human AD samples  and intravital brain imaging of clot formation and dissolution revealed abnormal thrombosis and fibrinolysis in AD mice. Moreover  depletion of fibrinogen lessened cerebral amyloid angiopathy pathology and reduced cognitive impairment in AD mice. These experiments suggest that one important contribution of Abeta to AD is via its effects on fibrin clots  implicating fibrin(ogen) as a potential critical factor in this disease.,0,Fibrinogen and beta-amyloid association alters thrombosis and fibrinolysis: a possible contributing factor to Alzheimer's disease.Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder in which vascular pathology plays an important role.

53253,MRI as a biomarker of disease progression in a therapeutic trial of milameline for AD.,OBJECTIVE: To assess the feasibility of using MRI measurements as a surrogate endpoint for disease progression in a therapeutic trial for AD. METHODS: A total of 362 patients with probable AD from 38 different centers participated in the MRI portion of a 52-week randomized placebo-controlled trial of milameline  a muscarinic receptor agonist. The therapeutic trial itself was not completed due to projected lack of efficacy on interim analysis; however  the MRI arm of the study was continued. Of the 362 subjects who underwent a baseline MRI study  192 subjects underwent a second MRI 1 year later. Hippocampal volume and temporal horn volume were measured from the MRI scans. RESULTS: The annualized percent changes in hippocampal volume (-4.9%) and temporal horn volume (16.1%) in the study patients were consistent with data from prior single-site studies. Correlations between the rate of MRI volumetric change and change in behavioral/cognitive measures were greater for the temporal horn than for the hippocampus. Decline over time was more consistently seen with imaging measures  99% of the time for the hippocampus  than behavioral/cognitive measures (p < 0.001). Greater consistency in MRI than behavioral/clinical measures resulted in markedly lower estimated sample size requirements for clinical trials. The estimated number of subjects per arm required to detect a 50% reduction in the rate of decline over 1 year are: AD Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale 320; Mini-Mental Status Examination 241; hippocampal volume 21; temporal horn volume 54. CONCLUSION: The consistency of MRI measurements obtained across sites  and the consistency between the multisite milameline data and that obtained in prior single-site studies  demonstrate the technical feasibility of using structural MRI measures as a surrogate endpoint of disease progression in therapeutic trials.

Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2, but clinical data supporting HCQ for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are limited. Methods This was a retrospective cohort study of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 who received >=1 dose of HCQ at two New York City hospitals. We measured incident Grade 3 or 4 blood count and liver test abnormalities, ventricular arrhythmias, and vomiting and diarrhea within 10 days after HCQ initiation, and the proportion of patients who completed HCQ therapy. We also describe changes in Sequential Organ Failure Assessment hypoxia scores between baseline and day 10 after HCQ initiation and in-hospital mortality. Results None of the 153 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 who received HCQ developed a sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia. Incident blood count and liver test abnormalities occurred in <15% of patients and incident vomiting or diarrhea was rare. Eighty-nine percent of patients completed their HCQ course and three patients discontinued therapy because of QT prolongation. Fifty-two percent of patients had improved hypoxia scores 10 days after starting HCQ. Thirty-one percent of patients who were receiving mechanical ventilation at the time of HCQ initiation died during their hospitalization, compared to 18% of patients who were receiving supplemental oxygen but not requiring mechanical ventilation, and 8% of patients who were not requiring supplemental oxygen. Co-administration of azithromycin was not associated with improved outcomes. Conclusions HCQ appears to be reasonably safe and tolerable in most hospitalized patients with COVID- 19.

Vascular endothelial growth factor is a mediator of hypoxia-induced endothelial cell proliferation and migration and is highly expressed in gliomas  where it acts as a potent regulator of angiogenesis. The use of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor antagonists and vascular endothelial growth factor scavenging antibodies has generated excitement in neuro-oncology because of the rapid but reversible decrease in vascular permeability. This decrease in vascular permeability is marked by a decrease in cerebral edema and a decrease in contrast enhancement visualized on magnetic resonance imaging. These effects on the tumor vasculature are mistakenly referred to as tumor responses because the historical method of measuring tumor response and progression was based on tumor size assessed by contrast permeability through a leaky blood brain barrier. Despite the difficulties in accurately measuring the effect of antivascular endothelial growth factor therapy on tumor viability  several studies confirm that the antivascular endothelial growth factor human monoclonal antibody bevacizumab combined with irinotecan can significantly improve 6-month progression free survival of patients with malignant gliomas compared with historical controls. The impact of cytotoxic chemotherapy on the efficacy of bevacizumab and the effect of this therapy on overall survival are important questions that remain to be answered.

47333,"Binding of copper (II) ion to an Alzheimer's tau peptide as revealed by MALDI-TOF MS, CD, and NMR.",The tau protein plays an important role in some neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs)  a biological marker for AD  are aggregates of bundles of paired helical filaments (PHFs). In general  the alpha-sheet structure favors aberrant protein aggregates. However  some reports have shown that the alpha-helix structure is capable of triggering the formation of aberrant tau protein aggregates and PHFs have a high alpha-helix content. In addition  the third repeat fragment in the four-repeat microtubule-binding domain of the tau protein (residues 306-336: VQIVYKPVDLSKVTSKCGSLGNIHHKPGGGQ  according to the longest tau protein) adopts a helical structure in trifluoroethanol (TFE) and may be a self-assembly model in the tau protein. In the human brain  there is a very small quantity of copper  which performs an important function. In our study  by means of matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS)  circular dichroism (CD)  and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy  the binding properties of copper (II) ion to the R3 peptide derived from the third repeat fragment (residues 318-335: VTSKCGSLGNIHHKPGGG) have been investigated. The results show that copper ions bind to the R3 peptide. CD spectra  ultraviolet (UV)-visible absorption spectra  and MALDI-TOF MS show pH dependence and stoichiometry of Cu2+ binding. Furthermore  CD spectra and NMR spectroscopy elucidate the copper binding sites located in the R3 peptide. Finally  CD spectra reveal that the R3 peptide adopts a mixture structure of random structures  alpha-helices  and beta-turns in aqueous solutions at physiological pH. At pH 7.5  the addition of 0.25 mol eq of Cu2+ induces the conformational change from the mixture mentioned above to a monomeric helical structure  and a beta-sheet structure forms in the presence of 1 mol eq of Cu2+. As alpha-helix and beta-sheet structures are responsible for the formation of PHFs  it is hypothesized that Cu2+ is an inducer of self-assembly of the R3 peptide and makes the R3 peptide form a structure like PHF. Hence  it is postulated that Cu2+ plays an important role in the aggregation of the R3 peptide and tau protein and that copper (II) binding may be another possible involvement in AD.,0,"Binding of copper (II) ion to an Alzheimer's tau peptide as revealed by MALDI-TOF MS, CD, and NMR.The tau protein plays an important role in some neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD).

56957,"Retropharyngeal and parapharyngeal abscess in children--epidemiology, clinical features and treatment.",OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical presentation  diagnosis  management and complications of children with retropharyngeal abscesses (RPAs) and parapharyngeal abscesses (PPAs). METHODS: A retrospective chart review was conducted at two tertiary care  pediatric hospitals in Israel. The medical records of all children <18 years who had been admitted with a diagnosis of RPA or PPA during an 11-year period (January 1997 to February 2008) were reviewed. Data on demographics  presenting symptoms  physical examination findings  imaging studies and interpretation  laboratory results  hospital course  medical treatment and surgical interventions were retrieved. RESULTS: A total of 39 children were diagnosed as having RPA (n=26  67%) or PPA (n=13  33%). There was a predominance of boys (61.5%). The mean age of all the children at diagnosis was 4 years. The annual incidence increased over the 11-year period. The most common symptoms at presentation included fever (n=27  70%) and neck pain (n=24  62%). The physical examination revealed cervical lymphadenopathy in 30 children (77%)  limitation of neck movements in 25 (64%)  torticollis in 21 (54%)  drooling in three (8%)  and stridor in two (5%). Computerized tomographic (CT) scanning with contrast was performed in 37 patients (95%)  of whom 17 underwent surgical drainage. Thirteen children were positively diagnosed as having an abscess by the finding of pus at surgery  of whom 12 had been found to have an abscess on their CT scan. All the patients received intravenous antibiotics. There was no significant difference in the duration of hospital stay between those who underwent surgery and those who were treated with antibiotics alone. There were no treatment failures and no complications in either of the two groups. CONCLUSION: Children with RPA most commonly present with restricted neck movements  fever and cervical lymphadenopathy  and rarely with respiratory distress or stridor.

DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective cohort study (March 16, 2020 to May 8, 2020). SETTING: Academic long-term chronic care facility (Boston, MA). PARTICIPANTS: Long-term care residents. METHODS: Patient characteristics and clinical symptoms were obtained via electronic medical records and Minimum Data Set. Staff residence was inferred by zip codes. COVID-19 infection was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction testing using nasopharyngeal swabs. Residents were followed until discharge from facility, death, or up to 21 days. Risks of COVID-19 infection were modeled by generalized estimating equation to estimate the relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of patient characteristics and staff community of residence. RESULTS: Overall 146 of 389 (37.5%) long-stay residents tested positive for COVID-19. At the time of positive test, 66 of 146 (45.5%) residents were asymptomatic. In the subsequent illness course, the most common symptom was anorexia (70.8%), followed by delirium (57.6%). During follow-up, 44 (30.1%) of residents with COVID-19 died. Mortality increased with frailty (16.7% in pre-frail, 22.2% in moderately frail, and 50.0% in frail; P < .001). The proportion of residents infected with COVID-19 varied across the long-term care units (range: 0%-90.5%). In adjusted models, male sex (RR 1.80, 95% CI 1.07, 3.05), bowel incontinence (RR 1.97, 95% CI 1.10, 3.52), and staff residence remained significant predictors of COVID-19. For every 10% increase in the proportion of staff living in a high prevalence community, the risk of testing positive increased by 6% (95% CI 1.04, 1.08). CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Among long-term care residents diagnosed with COVID-19, nearly one-half were asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis.

Since lymphocytes are the main immune cells battling with rapidly evolving viruses, it comes as no surprise to assume that a decreased number of these propitious soldiers may contribute to poor prognosis of the wide range of viral infections, including COVID-19. Method(s): To provide a better prospect representing the prognostic value of lymphopenia in COVID-19, we searched the national library of medicine Medline/PubMed and performed a meta-analysis of pertinent literature representing information on the lymphocyte count in COVID-19 patients. Result(s): The results of our meta-analysis revealed that the number of lymphocytes retains a specific clinical and biological significance in this infection and lymphopenia is seemingly an important hematological abnormality that contributes to mirror the evolution toward an unfavorable outcome. Conclusion(s): The rapidly evolving nature of COVID-19 together with relentless disclosure of novel findings denotes a major limitation to the current study, and further investigations in the field of prognostic biomarkers will definitively pave the way to better manage patients with severe COVID-19.Copyright ÁE© 2020, Iranian Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Society.

24580,Statins of different brain penetrability differentially affect CSF PLTP activity.,BACKGROUND/AIMS: Phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP) and apolipoprotein E (apoE) are key proteins involved in lipoprotein metabolism in the peripheral circulation and in the brain. Several epidemiological studies suggested that use of 3-hydroxyl-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) reduces risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However  the effects of statins of differing blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetrability on brain-derived molecules in cognitively normal individuals are largely unknown. METHODS: To assess the effect of statins on these indices as a function of BBB penetration  cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma PLTP activity and apoE concentration were measured in cognitively intact  modestly hypercholesterolemic adults randomly allocated to treatment with either pravastatin  which does not penetrate BBB (80 mg/day  n = 13)  or simvastatin  which penetrates BBB (40 mg/day  n = 10). RESULTS: Simvastatin significantly increased CSF PLTP activity (p = 0.005). In contrast  pravastatin had no such effect. In the pravastatin-treated group  CSF apoE concentration decreased significantly (p = 0.026)  while the simvastatin-treated group showed a tendency towards lower CSF apoE levels  with CSF apoE concentration lowered in 8 of 10 subjects. CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that statins differentially affect two key lipid transfer proteins in the brain  and that effect on PLTP activity depends on statin BBB penetrability.,0,Statins of different brain penetrability differentially affect CSF PLTP activity.BACKGROUND/AIMS: Phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP) and apolipoprotein E (apoE) are key proteins involved in lipoprotein metabolism in the peripheral circulation and in the brain.

4871,Is subacute thyroiditis an underestimated manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 infection? Insights from a case series,"CONTEXT: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has infected more than 18 million people worldwide and the pandemic is still spreading. After the first case we reported, we observed 4 additional cases of SAT related to SARS-CoV-2 infection. OBJECTIVES: To describe additional cases of SAT associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection in order to alert physicians that SAT may be a manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: We describe clinical, biochemical and imaging features of the 4 patients with SAT related to SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: All patients were female (age 29-46 years). SAT developed 16 to 36 days after the resolution of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Neck pain radiated to the jaw and palpitations were the main presenting symptoms and were associated with fever and asthenia. One patient was hospitalized because of atrial fibrillation. Thyroid function tests (available in three subjects) were suggestive of destructive thyroiditis and inflammatory markers were high. At neck ultrasound the thyroid was enlarged, with diffuse and bilateral hypoechoic areas and (in three patients) absent vascularization at color doppler. Symptoms disappeared a few days after commencement of treatment (prednisone in three patients and ibuprofen in one). Six weeks after the onset of SAT all patients were asymptomatic and inflammatory markers had turned back to the normal range. Two patients were euthyroid while two were diagnosed with subclinical hypothyroidism. CONCLUSIONS: SAT may be an underestimated manifestation of COVID-19. Clinicians should keep in mind the possible occurrence of SAT during and after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Copyright ÁE© Endocrine Society 2020. All rights reserved.

METHODS: Sixty-six participants (24 CHI  23 individuals with MCI  and 19 individuals with ADRD) were recruited in this cross-sectional study. The mean and standard deviation of the pTUG and iTUG completion times and the TUG delta time  as well as age  gender  and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores were used as outcomes. Participants were separated into three groups based on the tertilization of TUG delta time: lowest (<13.6%; nE=E22; best performance)  intermediate (13.6-52.2%; nE=E22)  and highest tertile (>52.2%; nE=E22  worst performance). RESULTS: Fewer CHI were in the group exhibiting the highest tertile of TUG delta time compared to individuals with lowest and intermediate TUG delta times (pE=E0.013).

49568,Multi-parametric classification of Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment: the impact of quantitative magnetization transfer MR imaging.,Multi-parametric and quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques have come into the focus of interest  both as a research and diagnostic modality for the evaluation of patients suffering from mild cognitive decline and overt dementia. In this study we address the question  if disease related quantitative magnetization transfer effects (qMT) within the intra- and extracellular matrices of the hippocampus may aid in the differentiation between clinically diagnosed patients with Alzheimer disease (AD)  patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and healthy controls. We evaluated 22 patients with AD (n=12) and MCI (n=10) and 22 healthy elderly (n=12) and younger (n=10) controls with multi-parametric MRI. Neuropsychological testing was performed in patients and elderly controls (n=34). In order to quantify the qMT effects  the absorption spectrum was sampled at relevant off-resonance frequencies. The qMT-parameters were calculated according to a two-pool spin-bath model including the T1- and T2 relaxation parameters of the free pool  determined in separate experiments. Histograms (fixed bin-size) of the normalized qMT-parameter values (z-scores) within the anterior and posterior hippocampus (hippocampal head and body) were subjected to a fuzzy-c-means classification algorithm with downstreamed PCA projection. The within-cluster sums of point-to-centroid distances were used to examine the effects of qMT- and diffusion anisotropy parameters on the discrimination of healthy volunteers  patients with Alzheimer and MCIs. The qMT-parameters T2(r) (T2 of the restricted pool) and F (fractional pool size) differentiated between the three groups (control  MCI and AD) in the anterior hippocampus.

There are few descriptions of the clinical presentation and evolution of consecutive SARS-CoV-2 infections with a long-enough follow up. Methods. Description of the first consecutive 100 patients with microbiologically-proven COVID-19 in a large hospital in Madrid, Spain including a minimum of two-month follow up. Results. The median age of the patients (52% males) was 61.5 years (IQR=39.5-82.0) and the median BMI was 28.8 kg/m2 (IQR=24.7-33.7). Overall 72% of the patients had one or more co-morbid conditions with a median age-adjusted Charlson index of 2 (IQR=0-5.7). Five patients (5%) were immunosup-pressed. The most common symptoms at the time of diagnosis were fever (80.0%), cough (53.0%) and dyspnea (23.0%). The median O2 saturation at the time of first examination was 94% (IQR=90-97). Chest X-ray on admission was compatible with pneumonia in 63% of the cases (bilateral in 42% and unilat-eral in 21%). Overall, 30% were managed at home and 70% were admitted to the hospital. Thirteen patients were admitted to the ICU with a median of 11 days of stay in the Unit (IQR=6.0-28.0). CALL score of our population ranged from 4 to 13. Overall, 60.0% of patients received antibiotic treatment and 66.0%, empirical antiviral treatment, mainly with lopina-vir/ritonavir (65%) or hydroxychloroquine (42%). Mortality, with a minimum of 60 days of follow up, was 23%. The median age of the deceased patients was 85 years (IQR=79-93). Conclusions.

26844,Midterm postoperative clinicoradiologic analysis of surgery for high/intermediate-type imperforate anus: prospective comparative study between laparoscopy-assisted and posterior sagittal anorectoplasty.,PURPOSE: The objective of this study is to analyze the outcome of surgery for high/intermediate-type imperforate anus using anal endosonography (AES)  magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)  and a continence evaluation questionnaire (CEQ). METHODS: In this study  24 cases of high/intermediate-type imperforate anus were studied. Fifteen of 24 had Georgeson's laparoscopy-assisted anorectoplasty (GLA)  and 9 of 24 had Pena's posterior sagittal anorectoplasty (PPA). All subjects had AES and MRI postoperatively. On AES  differences in thickness of the external sphincter (ES) and puborectalis (PR) at 3 and 9 o'clock were compared  and if pull-through colon was central  AES was 0. On MRI  differences in thickness were analyzed semiquantitatively and scored; if muscles were of even thickness  the score was 0; slight difference was 1  and marked difference was 2. A 5-parameter CEQ questionnaire (maximum score  10) was administered to 16 of 24 subjects followed up for more than 3 years (9 GLA  7 PPA). Surgical stress was assessed using mean febrile period  duration of raised white blood cell count  and peak C-reactive protein level. RESULTS: Mean age at surgery and mean postoperative period for both groups were not statistically different. There were no differences in mean muscle thickness for ES or PR on AES according to procedure (ES: GLA = 0.19 +/- 0.15 mm  PPA = 0.16 +/- 0.09 mm  P = .59; PR: GLA = 0.19 +/- 0.19 mm  PPA = 0.22 +/- 0.15 mm  P = .69). Magnetic resonance imaging scores were also not significantly different according to procedure (GLA: 0.77 +/- 0.83; PPA: 0.75 +/- 0.50  P = .97). When CEQ were compared annually  scores for GLA were generally higher throughout the study but only statistically significant at 3 and 4 years (P < .05). Differences in parameters of surgical stress were not significant. CONCLUSION: Although there were no differences in muscle thickness and parameters of surgical stress observed according to technique  GLA would appear to provide better outcome based on CEQ scores.,0,Midterm postoperative clinicoradiologic analysis of surgery for high/intermediate-type imperforate anus: prospective comparative study between laparoscopy-assisted and posterior sagittal anorectoplasty.PURPOSE: The objective of this study is to analyze the outcome of surgery for high/intermediate-type imperforate anus using anal endosonography (AES)  magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)  and a continence evaluation questionnaire (CEQ).

5203,"A thiol-reactive 18F-labeling agent, N-[2-(4-18F-fluorobenzamido)ethyl]maleimide, and synthesis of RGD peptide-based tracer for PET imaging of alpha v beta 3 integrin expression",The cell adhesion molecule integrin alpha v beta 3 plays a key role in tumor angiogenesis and metastasis. A series of 18F-labeled RGD peptides have been developed for PET of integrin expression based on primary amine-reactive prosthetic groups. In this study we introduced a new method of labeling RGD peptides through a thiol-reactive synthon  N-[2-(4-18F-fluorobenzamido)ethyl]maleimide (18F-FBEM). METHODS: 18F-FBEM was synthesized by coupling N-succinimidyl 4-18F-fluorobenzoate (18F-SFB) with N-(2-aminoethyl)maleimide. After high-pressure liquid chromatography purification  it was allowed to react with thiolated RGD peptides  and the resulting tracers were subjected to receptor-binding assay  in vivo metabolic stability assessment  biodistribution  and microPET studies in murine xenograft models. RESULTS: Conjugation of monomeric and dimeric sulfhydryl-RGD peptides with 18F-FBEM was achieved in high yields (85% +/- 5% nondecay-corrected on the basis of 18F-FBEM). The radiochemical purity of the 18F-labeled peptides was >98% and the specific activity was 100 approximately 150 TBq/mmol. Noninvasive microPET and direct tissue sampling experiments demonstrated that both 18F-FBEM-SRGD (RGD monomer) and 18F-FBEM-SRGD2 (RGD dimer) had integrin-specific tumor uptake in subcutaneous U87MG glioma and orthotopic MDA-MB-435 breast cancer xenografts. CONCLUSION: The new tracer 18F-FBEM-SRGD2 was synthesized with high specific activity via 18F-FBEM and the tracer exhibited high receptor-binding affinity  tumor-targeting efficacy  metabolic stability  as well as favorable in vivo pharmacokinetics.

3955,High resolution scanning tunnelling microscopy of the beta-amyloid protein (Abeta1-40) of Alzheimer's disease suggests a novel mechanism of oligomer assembly.,The aggregation of the beta-amyloid protein (Abeta) is an important step in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. There is increasing evidence that lower molecular weight oligomeric forms of Abeta may be the most toxic species in vivo. However  little is known about the structure of Abeta oligomers. In this study  scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) was used to examine the structure of Abeta monomers  dimers and oligomers. Abeta1-40 was visualised by STM on a surface of atomically flat gold. At low concentrations (0.5 microM) small globular structures were observed. High resolution STM of these structures revealed them to be monomers of Abeta. The monomers measured approximately 3-4 nm in diameter. Internal structure was seen in many of the monomers consistent with a conformation in which the polypeptide chain is folded into 3 or 4 domains. Oligomers were seen after ageing the Abeta solution for 24 h. The oligomers were also 3-4 nm in width and appeared to be formed by the end-to-end association of monomers with the polypeptide chain oriented at 90 degrees to the axis of the oligomer. The results suggest that the oligomer formation can proceed through a mechanism involving the linear association of monomers.,0,High resolution scanning tunnelling microscopy of the beta-amyloid protein (Abeta1-40) of Alzheimer's disease suggests a novel mechanism of oligomer assembly.The aggregation of the beta-amyloid protein (Abeta) is an important step in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.

38312,Identification of altered metabolic pathways in plasma and CSF in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease using metabolomics.,Alzheimer's Disease (AD) currently affects more than 5 million Americans  with numbers expected to grow dramatically as the population ages. The pathophysiological changes in AD patients begin decades before the onset of dementia  highlighting the urgent need for the development of early diagnostic methods. Compelling data demonstrate that increased levels of amyloid-beta compromise multiple cellular pathways; thus  the investigation of changes in various cellular networks is essential to advance our understanding of early disease mechanisms and to identify novel therapeutic targets. We applied a liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry-based non-targeted metabolomics approach to determine global metabolic changes in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the same individuals with different AD severity. Metabolic profiling detected a total of significantly altered 342 plasma and 351 CSF metabolites  of which 22% were identified. Based on the changes of >150 metabolites  we found 23 altered canonical pathways in plasma and 20 in CSF in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) vs. cognitively normal (CN) individuals with a false discovery rate <0.05. The number of affected pathways increased with disease severity in both fluids. Lysine metabolism in plasma and the Krebs cycle in CSF were significantly affected in MCI vs. CN. Cholesterol and sphingolipids transport was altered in both CSF and plasma of AD vs. CN. Other 30 canonical pathways significantly disturbed in MCI and AD patients included energy metabolism  Krebs cycle  mitochondrial function  neurotransmitter and amino acid metabolism  and lipid biosynthesis. Pathways in plasma that discriminated between all groups included polyamine  lysine  tryptophan metabolism  and aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis; and in CSF involved cortisone and prostaglandin 2 biosynthesis and metabolism.

2963,Tractography of the corpus callosum in Huntington's disease.,White matter abnormalities have been shown in presymptomatic and symptomatic Huntington's disease (HD) subjects using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) methods. The largest white matter tract  the corpus callosum (CC)  has been shown to be particularly vulnerable; however  little work has been done to investigate the regional specificity of tract abnormalities in the CC. Thus  this study examined the major callosal tracts by applying DTI-based tractography. Using TrackVis  a previously defined region of interest tractography method parcellating CC into seven major tracts based on target region was applied to 30 direction DTI data collected from 100 subjects: presymptomatic HD (Pre-HD) subjects (n=25)  HD patients (n=25) and healthy control subjects (n=50). Tractography results showed decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) and increased radial diffusivity (RD) across broad regions of the CC in Pre-HD subjects. Similar though more severe deficits were seen in HD patients. In Pre-HD and HD  callosal FA and RD were correlated with Disease Burden/CAG repeat length as well as motor (UHDRSI) and cognitive (URDRS2) assessments. These results add evidence that CC pathways are compromised prior to disease onset with possible demyelination occurring early in the disease and suggest that CAG repeat length is a contributing factor to connectivity deficits.

These indications include diagnosis  staging  and therapy monitoring. In this review  we discuss the articles in which FDG-PET is clinically used for monitoring therapy in breast cancer  lymphomas and gliomas. It is found that the amount of FDG uptake strongly correlates with response to therapy in breast cancer  lymphomas  and gliomas; a decrease in FDG uptake after therapy indicates a positive response to therapy. However  this conclusion is based on small patient numbers  whereas the exact response mechanism is still unknown. Therefore  more studies in comparable patient groups are required to achieve a better understanding of FDG uptake patterns after therapy.

35351,"The impact of COVID-19 lockdown on the air quality of Eastern Province, Saudi Arabia","Since the identification of the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, the death toll from the direct infection by COVID-19 has exceeded 775,000, and more than 21 million cases have been reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) around the world. It is strongly believed that its impact might be worsened by poor outdoor and indoor air qualities, particularly on older adults. The nationwide lockdown measures were imposed between March 23 and June 20, 2020, to stop the spread of COVID-19 pandemic in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). In this work, the possible effects of the lockdown on the air quality were investigated using meteorological and air quality datasets obtained from eight monitoring stations covering the Eastern Province of the KSA. The studied air pollutants include carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3), and inhalable particulate matter (PM10). The NO2 was found to be the marker pollutant responding best to the lockdown measures since its concentrations decreased at all sites during- and post-lockdown periods and ranged between 12-86% and 14-81%, respectively. Compared with pre-lockdown period, the Eastern Province also experienced significant concentration reductions at varying rates for PM10 (21-70%), CO (5.8-55%), and SO2 (8.7-30%), while O3 concentrations showed increasing rates ranging between 6.3 and 45%. The consequences of these reductions were reflected in easing the outdoor air quality, which might reduce the impact of COVID-19 pandemic, especially on elderly and sensitive groups.

56130,Whole brain diffusion tensor imaging in HIV-associated cognitive impairment.,BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Quantitative MR imaging strategies may have considerable potential for in vivo assessment of neuropathologic changes associated with HIV. This investigation evaluated the prognostic significance of whole brain histogram-derived diffusion tensor imaging indices with respect to severity of cognitive impairment and measures of clinical status in cases of HIV. METHODS: Quantitative indices derived with diffusion tensor imaging  including whole brain fractional anisotropy and the apparent diffusion coefficient  were compared for six patients with HIV and eight control volunteers. Relationships between whole brain indices and specific measures of dementia severity and clinical status were examined. RESULTS: Whole brain fractional anisotropy was reduced in patients with HIV and was significantly associated with severity of dementia  as indicated by several widely used clinical and functional status measures. Summary fractional anisotropy measures were more prognostic of dementia status than were apparent diffusion coefficient measures. CONCLUSION: Findings from this investigation support the use of diffusion tensor imaging for noninvasive MR imaging measurement of neuropathologic changes in studies of HIV-associated cognitive impairment.,0,Whole brain diffusion tensor imaging in HIV-associated cognitive impairment.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Quantitative MR imaging strategies may have considerable potential for in vivo assessment of neuropathologic changes associated with HIV.

49019,Androgen-deprivation therapies for prostate cancer and risk of infection by SARS-CoV-2: a population-based study (n=4532),"BACKGROUND: Cell entry of SARS-CoV-2 depends on binding of the viral spike (S) proteins to ACE2 and on S protein priming by TMPRSS2. Inhibition of TMPRSS2 may work to block or decrease the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Intriguingly, TMPRSS2 is an androgen-regulated gene that is upregulated in prostate cancer where it supports tumor progression and is involved in a frequent genetic translocation with the ERG gene. First- or second-generation androgen-deprivation therapies (ADTs) decrease the levels of TMPRSS2. Here we put forward the hypothesis that ADTs may protect patients affected by prostate cancer from SARS-CoV-2 infections. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We extracted data regarding 9280 patients (4532 males) with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection from 68 hospitals in Veneto, one of the Italian regions that was most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The parameters used for each COVID-19 positive patient were gender, hospitalization, admission to intensive care unit (ICU), death, tumor diagnosis, prostate cancer diagnosis, and androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT). RESULTS: There were 9280 SARS-CoV-2 positive patients in the Veneto on April 1, 2020. Overall, males developed more severe complications, were more frequently hospitalized, and had a worse clinical outcome than females. Considering only the Veneto male population (2.4 Million men), 0.2% and 0.3% of non-cancer and cancer patients, respectively, tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Comparing the total number of SARS-CoV-2 positive cases, prostate cancer patients receiving ADT had a significantly lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to patients who did not receive ADT (OR 4.05; 95% CI 1.55-10.59). A greater difference was found comparing prostate cancer patients receiving ADT to patients with any other type of cancer (OR 5.17; 95% CI 2.02-13.40). CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that cancer patients have an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infections than non-cancer patients.

24095,Task difficulty modulates young-old differences in network expression.,The extent of task-related fMRI activation can vary as a function of task difficulty. Also the efficiency or capacity of the brain networks underlying task performance can change with aging. We asked whether the expression of a network underlying task performance would differ as a function of task demand in old and young individuals. 26 younger and 23 older healthy adults performed a delayed item recognition task that used the response signal method to parametrically manipulate the extrinsic difficulty of the task by imposing five different deadlines for recognition response. Both age groups showed a speed-accuracy trade-off  but the younger group achieved greater discriminability at the longer deadlines. We identified a spatial pattern of fMRI activation during the probe phase whose expression increased as the response deadline shortened and the task became more difficult. This pattern was expressed to a greater degree by the old group at the long deadlines  when the task was easiest. By contrast  this pattern was expressed to a greater degree by the younger group at the short deadlines  when the task was hardest. This suggests reduced efficiency and capacity of this network in older subjects. These findings suggest that neuroimaging studies comparing task-related activation across groups with different cognitive abilities must be interpreted in light of the relative difficulty of the task for each group.,0,Task difficulty modulates young-old differences in network expression.The extent of task-related fMRI activation can vary as a function of task difficulty.

22118,Perpendicular fibre tracking for neural fibre bundle analysis using diffusion MRI.,Information on the directionality and structure of axonal fibres in neural tissue can be obtained by analysing diffusion-weighted MRI data sets. Several fibre tracking algorithms have been presented in the literature that trace the underlying field of principal orientations of water diffusion  which correspond to the local primary eigenvectors of the diffusion tensor field. However  the majority of the existing techniques ignore the secondary and tertiary orientations of diffusion  which contain significant information on the local patterns of diffusion. In this paper  we introduce the idea of perpendicular fibre tracking and present a novel dynamic programming method that traces surfaces  which are locally perpendicular to the axonal fibres. This is achieved by using a cost function  with geometric and fibre orientation constraints  that is evaluated dynamically for every voxel in the image domain starting from a given seed point. The proposed method is tested using synthetic and real DW-MRI data sets. The results conclusively demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of our method.,0,Perpendicular fibre tracking for neural fibre bundle analysis using diffusion MRI.Information on the directionality and structure of axonal fibres in neural tissue can be obtained by analysing diffusion-weighted MRI data sets.

Results A total of 95 invitees completed the survey. Over a quarter had required time off work due to COVID symptoms or contact. All respondents described either introducing or increasing the use of remote patient consultations. Most striking was the rise in video consultations from just 3% to 95% during the pandemic. Almost half of the feedback on the usefulness of remote consultations were positive, 16% were negative and 17% were mixed. The most commonly cited benefit was time efficiency. Drawbacks of remote consultations included technical difficulties and poor patient communication. Practice premises, systems and processes also required significant modifications during the pandemic to ensure the provision of safe clinical care, including reception screens, one-way patient flow, greater infection prevention measures. However, despite their ability to introduce such widescale change virtually overnight, over 10% of respondents reported that the strain had placed their practice at risk of closure. Over half of respondents felt they were not provided with adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) for the safety of their staff. Perception of the support provided by NHS England and the Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs) was rather mixed, although additional guidelines were broadly welcomed. The most requested enduring changes related to remote patient consultations (59%) and remote triage (19%). However, in order to support such largescale permanent change, study respondents felt that a different funding and financial structure is required together with improved IT infrastructure, greater patient education and a more supportive regulatory environment. Conclusions COVID-19 has substantially accelerated the pace of change within NHS primary care. The long-term fear is that there may be insufficient financial and clinical backing from regulatory bodies to support such rapid and far-reaching changes.

32663,Review article: Treatment of perianal fistulizing Crohn's disease,"Fistulizing Crohn's disease can involve the bowel, but is more commonly seen in the perianal region. In acute perianal Crohn's disease, perianal lesions are manifestations of disease activity and are frequently treated concomitantly with bowel lesions. Spontaneous resolution occurs in up to 50% of patients. Fistulae are secondary lesions that may progress to destruction of the sphincter apparatus necessitating proctectomy after years of suffering. The control of sepsis is the first objective. The drainage of abscesses and the placement of setons are essential steps in treatment. Disease severity can be readily assessed by examination under anaesthesia and by magnetic resonance imaging. Endoscopic ultrasonography is sensitive, but is hampered by the necessary introduction of a large instrument into an often narrowed anorectum. Antibiotics, especially metronidazole and ciprofloxacin, are useful short-term therapies to decrease or stop drainage, but relapse is immediate on discontinuation. Immunosuppression with azathioprine (2.5 mg/kg per day) or mercaptopurine (1.5 mg/kg per day) is effective, but slow and often incomplete. The management of perianal fistulizing disease resistant to standard treatment has greatly improved with the introduction of the antitumour necrosis factor-EEE antibody, infliximab. The complete arrest of the drainage of fistulae is obtained in 46% of patients 10 weeks after the administration of 5-10 mg/kg of infliximab at weeks 0, 2 and 6 and, on average, lasts for 12 weeks.

38453,Color-coded diffusion-tensor-imaging of posterior cingulate fiber tracts in mild cognitive impairment.,Different processes like microvascular dysfunction  free radical toxicity  beta-amyloid deposits  and Wallerian degeneration can cause functionally relevant disturbances of cerebral neuronal networks by myelin degeneration. Color-coded diffusion-tensor-imaging (ccDTI) allows the structural identification and quantification of myelinated fiber tracts. Particularly  posterior cingulate fiber tracts  which are regarded as important neuronal substrates of the network representing memory processing can be localized only imprecisely by conventional magnetic resonance imaging techniques. The posterior cingulate bundles were assessed by ccDTI in 17 patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI)  25 patients with Alzheimer's dementia (DAT)  and 21 age-matched controls. Additionally  DTI values were correlated with memory performance in the delayed verbal recall test. Fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity differed significantly between MCI and controls  as well as between DAT and controls. Performance in the delayed verbal recall test of the entire study group correlated significantly with posterior cingulate bundle anisotropy and diffusivity. Using ccDTI seems  hence  a favorable strategy to detect and quantify the structural integrity of posterior cingulate white matter in MCI. Alterations of DTI parameters substantiate the involvement of white matter pathology in the development of MCI. Moreover  ccDTI could serve as in vivo method to investigate age and disease-related myelin alterations as potential morphological substrates of cognitive dysfunction.,0,Color-coded diffusion-tensor-imaging of posterior cingulate fiber tracts in mild cognitive impairment.Different processes like microvascular dysfunction  free radical toxicity  beta-amyloid deposits  and Wallerian degeneration can cause functionally relevant disturbances of cerebral neuronal networks by myelin degeneration.

32943,Stabilization of transcription factor Nrf2 by tBHQ prevents oxidative stress-induced amyloid beta formation in NT2N neurons.,Alzheimer's disease (AD) a progressive neurodegenerative disorder of later life  is characterized by brain deposition of amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) plaques  accumulation of intracellular neurofibrillatory tangles  synaptic loss and neuronal cell death. There is significant evidence that oxidative stress is a critical event in the pathogenesis of AD. In the present study Abeta formation was induced in NT2N neurons  one of the most appropriate cell line models in AD. Our results indicate that oxidative stress resulting from the treatment of H(2)O(2)/FeSO(4) and/or 4-hydroxy-2-noenal (HNE) can be inhibited in the presence of tBHQ  a known inducer of nuclear factor-erythroid 2 related factor 2 (Nrf2) in NT2N neurons and can therefore be used to elucidate the relationship between oxidative stress  Abeta formation and Nrf2. The role of Nrf2 was confirmed using retinoic acid as an inhibitor of Nrf2. It provides the first documentation that tBHQ not only protects the neurons against cell death but also decreases amyloid beta formation. Moreover  the results indicate that oxidative stress fosters Abeta formation in NT2N neurons  creating a vicious neurodegenerative loop.,0,Stabilization of transcription factor Nrf2 by tBHQ prevents oxidative stress-induced amyloid beta formation in NT2N neurons.Alzheimer's disease (AD) a progressive neurodegenerative disorder of later life  is characterized by brain deposition of amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) plaques  accumulation of intracellular neurofibrillatory tangles  synaptic loss and neuronal cell death.

25628,Effects of emotionally-rated material on visual memory in Alzheimer's disease in relation to medial temporal atrophy.,Emotional material tends to be better retrieved in memory than neutral material. This emotional enhancement of memory may be related to the attentional effects of the amygdala's response to emotional stimuli. Because early neuropathological changes in Alzheimer's disease involve the amygdala and the hippocampus  it has been suggested that this effect is impaired in patients. However inconsistent results have been reported. The goal of our study was to evaluate the effects of emotion on picture recognition in patients affected by Alzheimer's disease  and to explore the link between this effect and the degree of amygdalar and hippocampal atrophy. Mild Alzheimer's disease patients (n = 15) and control participants (n = 20) performed an Old/New recognition task using pictures of negative  neutral  and positive emotional valence. Automated segmentation of their high-resolution T1 MRI scans was performed in order to obtain amygdalar and hippocampal volumes. Correlation analyses were then performed between volumetric data  memory  and the emotional effect on memory. An effect of emotion on memory was found for control participants (with positive items being better recognized than neutral and negative ones)  with no correlation between this effect and medial temporal volumes  and a significant correlation between overall recognition scores and hippocampal volumes. Conversely  no emotional effect on memory was found across the group of patients; however  significant correlations were found between the loss of this effect and amygdalar and hippocampal volumes. These results tend to confirm a link between the loss of emotional effect on memory and neuropathological change in medial temporal structures during the course of Alzheimer's disease.,0,Effects of emotionally-rated material on visual memory in Alzheimer's disease in relation to medial temporal atrophy.Emotional material tends to be better retrieved in memory than neutral material.

48871,Neuropeptides in hippocampus and cortex in transgenic mice overexpressing V717F beta-amyloid precursor protein--initial observations.,Immunohistochemistry was used to analyse 18- and 26-month-old transgenic mice overexpressing the human beta-amyloid precursor protein under the platelet-derived growth factor-beta promoter with regard to presence and distribution of neuropeptides. In addition  antisera/antibodies to tyrosine hydroxylase  acetylcholinesterase  amyloid peptide  glial fibrillary acidic protein and microglial marker OX42 were used. These mice have been reported to exhibit extensive amyloid plaques in the hippocampus and cortex [Masliah et al. (1996) J. Neurosci. 16  5795-5811]. The most pronounced changes were related to neuropeptides  whereas differences between wild-type and transgenic mice were less prominent with regard to tyrosine hydroxylase and acetylcholinesterase. The main findings were of two types; (i) involvement of peptide-containing neurites in amyloid beta-peptide positive plaques  and (ii) more generalized changes in peptide levels in specific layers  neuron populations and/or subregions in the hippocampal formation and ventral cortices. In contrast  the parietal and auditory cortices were comparatively less affected. The peptide immunoreactivities most strongly involved  both in plaques and in the generalized changes  were galanin  neuropeptide Y  cholecystokinin and enkephalin. This study shows that there is considerable variation both with regard to plaque load and peptide expression even among homozygotes of the same age. The most pronounced changes  predominantly increased peptide levels  were observed in two 26-month-old homozygous mice  for example  galanin-  enkephalin- and cholecystokinin-like immunoreactivities in stratum lacunosum moleculare  and galanin  neuropeptide Y  enkephalin and dynorphin in mossy fibers. Many peptides also showed elevated levels in the ventral cortices. However  decreases were also observed. Thus  galanin-like immunoreactivity could not any longer be detected in the diffusely distributed (presumably noradrenergic) fiber network in all hippocampal and cortical layers  and dynorphin-like immunoreactivity was decreased in stratum moleculare  cholecystokinin-like immunoreactivity in mossy fibers and substance P-like immunoreactivity in fibers around granule cells. The significance of generalized peptide changes is at present unclear. For example  the increase in the mainly inhibitory peptides galanin  neuropeptide Y  enkephalin and dynorphin and the decrease in the mainly excitatory peptide cholecystokinin in mossy fibers (and of substance P fibers around granule cells) indicate a shift in balance towards inhibition of the input to the CA3 pyramidal cell layer. Moreover  it may be speculated that the increase in levels of some of the peptides represents a reaction to nerve injury with the aim to counteract  in different ways  the consequences of injury  for example by exerting trophic actions. Further studies will be needed to establish to what extent these changes are typical for Alzheimer mouse models in general or are associated with the V717F mutation and/or the platelet-derived growth factor-beta promoter.,0,Neuropeptides in hippocampus and cortex in transgenic mice overexpressing V717F beta-amyloid precursor protein--initial observations.Immunohistochemistry was used to analyse 18- and 26-month-old transgenic mice overexpressing the human beta-amyloid precursor protein under the platelet-derived growth factor-beta promoter with regard to presence and distribution of neuropeptides.

Of these, thermal inactivation is generally considered an effective and cheap method of sample preparation for downstream assays. The purpose of this study is to establish a safe inactivation method for SARS-CoV-2 without compromising the amount of amplifiable viral genome necessary for clinical diagnoses. In this study, we demonstrate the infectivity and genomic stability of SARSCoV- 2 by thermal inactivation at both 56degreeC and 65degreeC. The results substantiate that viable SARS-CoV-2 is readily inactivated when incubated at 56degreeC for 30 min or at 65degreeC for 10 min. qRT-PCR of specimens heat-inactivated at 56degreeC for 30 min or 65degreeC for 15 min revealed similar genomic RNA stability compared with non-heat inactivated specimens. Further, we demonstrate that 30 min of thermal inactivation at 56degreeC could inactivate viable viruses from clinical COVID-19 specimens without attenuating the qRT-PCR diagnostic sensitivity. Heat treatment of clinical specimens from COVID-19 patients at 56degreeC for 30 min or 65degreeC for 15 min could be a useful method for the inactivation of a highly contagious agent, SARS-CoV-2.

42434,RNA interference-mediated silencing of X11alpha and X11beta attenuates amyloid beta-protein levels via differential effects on beta-amyloid precursor protein processing.,Processing of the beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) plays a key role in Alzheimer disease neuropathogenesis. APP is cleaved by beta- and alpha-secretase to produce APP-C99 and APP-C83  which are further cleaved by gamma-secretase to produce amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) and p3  respectively. APP adaptor proteins with phosphotyrosine-binding domains  including X11alpha (MINT1  encoded by gene APBA1) and X11beta (MINT2  encoded by gene APBA2)  can bind to the conserved YENPTY motif in the APP C terminus. Overexpression of X11alpha and X11beta alters APP processing and Abeta production. Here  for the first time  we have described the effects of RNA interference (RNAi) silencing of X11alpha and X11beta expression on APP processing and Abeta production. RNAi silencing of APBA1 in H4 human neuroglioma cells stably transfected to express either full-length APP or APP-C99 increased APP C-terminal fragment levels and lowered Abeta levels in both cell lines by inhibiting gamma-secretase cleavage of APP. RNAi silencing of APBA2 also lowered Abeta levels  but apparently not via attenuation of gamma-secretase cleavage of APP. The notion of attenuating gamma-secretase cleavage of APP via the APP adaptor protein X11alpha is particularly attractive with regard to therapeutic potential given that side effects of gamma-secretase inhibition due to impaired proteolysis of other gamma-secretase substrates  e.g. Notch  might be avoided.,0,RNA interference-mediated silencing of X11alpha and X11beta attenuates amyloid beta-protein levels via differential effects on beta-amyloid precursor protein processing.Processing of the beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) plays a key role in Alzheimer disease neuropathogenesis.

Outcomes over a 10-year period.,BACKGROUND: The purpose of the present study is to evaluate current echocardiographically (echo)-guided pericardiocentesis practice with regard to procedural success  complication rate  etiological causes  and outcomes of patients with clinically significant pericardial effusion.  PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients who underwent echo-guided pericardiocentesis between January 2004 and February 2014 were identified using an institutional code for the procedure. Other complementary data were obtained by interviewing patients or their relatives (directly or by telephone) and by searching the social security death index.  RESULTS: A total of 301 patients were identified. The pericardium was approached via the subcostal (85 %) or apical (15 %) route under echo guidance in all procedures. The success rate was 97 %  with an intervention-requiring complication rate of 1.3 %. No patient died from complications. The most common etiology was malignancy (n = 84  28 %). Patients were followed-up for a median of 35 months. Median survival for patients with malignant effusion was 5.9 months compared with 54 months for those with nonmalignant effusion.  CONCLUSIONS: Echo-guided pericardiocentesis has a high success and low complication rate in current practice. Among etiologies  malignancy remains the most common cause of clinically significant pericardial effusion and is associated with a poor prognosis.,0,Echo-guided pericardiocentesis in patients with clinically significant pericardial effusion.

With no specific therapeutic and prophylactic options available, the virus has infected millions of people of which more than half a million succumbed to the viral disease, COVID-19. The urgent need for an effective treatment together with a lack of small animal infection models has led to clinical trials using repurposed drugs without preclinical evidence of their in vivo efficacy. We established an infection model in Syrian hamsters to evaluate the efficacy of small molecules on both infection and transmission. Treatment of SARS-CoV-2-infected hamsters with a low dose of favipiravir or hydroxychloroquine with(out) azithromycin resulted in, respectively, a mild or no reduction in virus levels. However, high doses of favipiravir significantly reduced infectious virus titers in the lungs and markedly improved lung histopathology. Moreover, a high dose of favipiravir decreased virus transmission by direct contact, whereas hydroxychloroquine failed as prophylaxis. Pharmacokinetic modeling of hydroxychloroquine suggested that the total lung exposure to the drug did not cause the failure. Our data on hydroxychloroquine (together with previous reports in macaques and ferrets) thus provide no scientific basis for the use of this drug in COVID-19 patients. In contrast, the results with favipiravir demonstrate that an antiviral drug at nontoxic doses exhibits a marked protective effect against SARS-CoV-2 in a small animal model.

45526,Widespread cortical thinning characterizes patients with MS with mild cognitive impairment.,BACKGROUND: Although cognitive dysfunction affects a relevant portion of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS)  its pathologic substrate has not been clarified and it does not seem entirely explained by white matter changes. METHODS: A total of 100 consecutive patients with relapsing remitting MS (RRMS) and 42 normal controls (NC) were enrolled in the study. Cognitive performance was assessed by Rao's Brief Repeatable Battery of Neuropsychological Tests (BRB). Regional cortical thickness (CTh) was evaluated by Freesurfer. RESULTS: Thirty-one patients with RRMS failed 1 or 2 tests of BRB and were considered to have a mild cognitive impairment (mCI-RRMS)  while 8 patients failed at least 3 tests and were classified as markedly impaired (sCI-RRMS). The mean CTh of mCI-RRMS and sCI-RRMS group was significantly lower than in NC (p < 0.001) and cognitively normal patients with RRMS (CN-RRMS) (p < 0.001). The regional analysis revealed significant cortical thinning in frontal and temporal regions (frontotemporal thinning) of CN-RRMS compared to NC  while a widespread pattern of cortical thinning was observed in mCI-RRMS and in sCI-RRMS compared to both CN-RRMS and NC. A correlation was observed between cognitive score (CS) and the mean CTh (r = -0.69  p < 0.001) and between CS and CTh of almost all the cortical areas analyzed (r value between -0.20 and -0.65  p < 0.01). A correlation was found between T2-WM-LV and mean CTh (r = -0.31  p = 0.004) or CS (r = 0.21  p = 0.031).

DNA nanoball sequencing shows that the transcriptome is highly complex owing to numerous discontinuous transcription events. In addition to the canonical genomic and 9 subgenomic RNAs, SARS-CoV-2 produces transcripts encoding unknown ORFs with fusion, deletion, and/or frameshift.

Patients-Pancreatectomy specimens from 12 patients with non- alcoholic chronic pancreatitis, including four patients with autoimmune or related diseases (Sjogren's syndrome, primary sclerosing cholangitis, ulcerative colitis, and Crohn's disease), were reviewed. Methods - Morphological changes were studied histologically and immunohistochemically (to type inflammatory cells) and compared with the pancreatic alterations found in 12 patients with alcoholic chronic pancreatitis. Results - In patients with non-alcoholic chronic pancreatitis, with or without associated autoimmune or related diseases, pancreatic inflammation particularly involved the ducts, commonly resulting in duet obstruction and occasionally duct destruction. None of these features was seen in alcoholic chronic pancreatitis which, however, showed pseudocysts and calcifications.

Seventy-nine subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) underwent EEG recording and magnetic resonance imaging scan. Based on the tertiles values of decreasing AHC volume  three groups of AHC growing atrophy were obtained.

493,Gastrointestinal symptoms and digestive comorbidities in an Italian cohort of patients with COVID-19,"OBJECTIVE: The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic mainly involves respiratory symptoms, though gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms are increasingly being recognized. In this context, the presence of comorbidities appears to be associated with adverse outcomes. However, the role of digestive manifestations is not yet well defined. The primary aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of GI symptoms and digestive comorbidities in a cohort of patients with COVID-19 compared to controls. The secondary aim was to determine the association of GI-symptoms and digestive comorbidities with clinical outcomes. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Inpatients with COVID-19 and controls with similar symptoms and/or radiological findings were enrolled. Symptoms at admission and throughout hospitalization were collected as they were comorbidities. The measured clinical outcomes were mortality, intensive care unit admission and cumulative endpoint. RESULTS: A total of 105 patients were included: 34 with COVID-19 and 71 controls. At admission, the prevalence of GI symptoms among COVID-19 patients was 8.8%. During hospitalization, the frequency of GI symptoms was higher in patients with COVID-19 than in controls (p=0.004). Among patients with COVID-19, the mortality and a cumulative endpoint rates of those with GI symptoms were both lower than for those without GI symptoms (p=0.016 and p=0.000, respectively). Finally, we found digestive comorbidities to be associated with a milder course of COVID-19 (p=0.039 for cumulative endpoint). CONCLUSIONS: Our results highlighted the non-negligible frequency of GI symptoms in patients with COVID-19, partly attributable to the therapies implemented. In addition, the presence of GI symptoms and digestive comorbidities is associated with better outcomes. Most likely, digestive comorbidities do not hinder the host's immune response against SARS-COV-2, and the occurrence of GI symptoms might be linked to a faster reduction of the viral load via the faecal route.",0,"Gastrointestinal symptoms and digestive comorbidities in an Italian cohort of patients with COVID-19OBJECTIVE: The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic mainly involves respiratory symptoms, though gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms are increasingly being recognized.

15069,"Interspinous bursitis is common in polymyalgia rheumatica, but is not associated with spinal pain",INTRODUCTION: Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) is a common inflammatory disease in older people characterized by shoulder and/or pelvic girdle  and cervical and  occasionally  lumbar pain. Interspinous bursitis has been suggested as a potential cause of spinal symptoms. We evaluated  by 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography integrated with computed tomography (PET/CT)  the vertebral structures involved in PMR in a cohort of consecutive  untreated patients. METHODS: Sixty-five consecutive patients with PMR were studied. After a standardized physical examination  which included evaluation of pain and tenderness in the vertebral column  they underwent FDG-PET/CT. Sites of increased uptake and their correlation with spontaneous and provoked pain were recorded. For comparison  FDG-PET/CT was performed also in 65 age- and sex-matched controls and in 10 rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. RESULTS: The most frequent site of spontaneous and provoked pain was the cervical portion. FDG uptake was more frequent in the lumbar portion than at any other location  and in the cervical rather than in the thoracic portion (P <0.0001). No correlation was found between uptake and spontaneous or provoked pain. There was an association between presence of cervical and lumbar bursitis (r = 0.34  P = 0.007). None of the control patients and one out of ten RA patients showed interspinous bursitis. CONCLUSIONS: Interspinous bursitis is a frequent finding in the lumbar spine of patients with PMR. However  it is not associated with clinical symptoms and can hardly explain the spinal pain reported by the patients. Cervical pain is more frequent than lumbar pain in PMR patients and may be caused by shoulder girdle involvement.,0,"Interspinous bursitis is common in polymyalgia rheumatica, but is not associated with spinal painINTRODUCTION: Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) is a common inflammatory disease in older people characterized by shoulder and/or pelvic girdle  and cervical and  occasionally  lumbar pain.

64240,Anatomically-distinct genetic associations of APOE epsilon4 allele load with regional cortical atrophy in Alzheimer's disease.,APOE epsilon4 is the best-established genetic risk factor for sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD). However  while homozygotes show greater disease susceptibility and earlier age of onset than heterozygotes  they may not show faster rates of clinical progression. We hypothesize that there are differential APOE epsilon4 allele-load dependent influences on neuropathology across the brain. Our aim was to define the relationship between APOE epsilon4 allele load and regionally-specific brain cortical atrophy in Alzheimer's Disease (AD). For this reason voxel-based morphometry (VBM) was performed using T1-weighted MR images from 83 AD patients  contrasting regional cortical grey matter by APOE epsilon4 load according to either dominant or genotypic models. Patients fulfilled NINCDS-ADRDA criteria and were genotyped for APOE epsilon4 (15 epsilon4/epsilon4  39 epsilon4/- and 29-/-). We observed that grey matter volume (GMV) decreased additively with increasing allele load in the medial (MTL) and anterior temporal lobes bilaterally. By contrast  a 2 degree-of-freedom genotypic model suggested a dominant effect of the APOE epsilon4 allele in the left temporal lobe. Brain regions showing a significant APOE epsilon4 allele load effect on GMV in AD included only some of those typically described as having greatest amyloid plaque deposition and atrophy. Temporal regions appeared to show a dominant effect of APOE epsilon4 allele load instead of the additive effect previously strongly associated with age of onset. Regional variations with allele load may be related to different mechanisms for effects of APOE epsilon4 load on susceptibility and disease progression.,0,Anatomically-distinct genetic associations of APOE epsilon4 allele load with regional cortical atrophy in Alzheimer's disease.APOE epsilon4 is the best-established genetic risk factor for sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD).

36070,Effects of blood pressure lowering in patients with acute ischemic stroke and carotid artery stenosis.,BACKGROUND: The Scandinavian Candesartan Acute Stroke Trial (SCAST) showed no beneficial clinical effects of blood pressure lowering with the angiotensin receptor blocker candesartan in the acute phase of stroke. In the present analysis we wanted to see if the effects of blood pressure lowering are harmful in the subgroup of patients with carotid artery stenosis. METHODS: SCAST was a randomized- and placebo-controlled  double-masked trial of 2029 patients with acute stroke and high systolic blood pressure (k}e 140 mmHg). Of 1733 patients with ischemic stroke 993 underwent carotid artery imaging  and the degree of stenosis was categorized as no/insignificant (0-49%  n = 806)  moderate (50-69%  n = 97) or severe (k}e 70%  n = 90). The trial's two co-primary effect variables were the composite end-point of vascular death  stroke or myocardial infarction  and functional outcome at six-months  according to the modified Rankin Scale. RESULTS: Among patients with moderate or severe carotid artery stenosis the vascular end-point occurred in 9 of 87 patients (10.3%) treated with candesartan and in 17 of 100 controls (17.0%)  and there was no evidence of a different risk in patients with severe stenosis (adjusted hazard ratio 0.74  95% confidence interval 0.28-1.96  P = 0.54).

METHOD: The study was conducted in three stages. Stage 1: From a potential pool of 30 000 subjects aged 40 years or more  24 488 (male = 11 875; female = 12 613) persons completed self-report or interviewer-rated protocols based on the Sandoz Clinical Assessment Geriatric Scale  but 5 512 (18.37%) persons refused to participate. Scores on the protocol had a possible range from 0 through 34. Stage 2: Persons with a score +2 SD above the mean were selected in this stage where the persons were screened for cognitive functioning using a modified and translated version of the Mini-Mental State Examination. Individuals who scored below the 5th percentile were included in Stage 3 and underwent a detailed neurological  psychiatric  and neuropsychological evaluation as well as hematological  radiological  electrocardiographic  and electroencephalographic investigations. Diagnoses were made jointly by a neurologist  psychiatrist  and psychologist using the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria. Subjects were also rated on the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scale and assessed for activities of daily living. RESULTS: One hundred five subjects with dementia (CDR > or = 0.5) were identified in this population of 24 488 persons. The prevalence rate for dementia in those aged 40 years and more was 0.43% and for persons aged 65 and above was 2.44%. Seventy-eight individuals had a CDR of > or = 1 yielding an overall prevalence rate of 0.32%  and a prevalence rate of 1.81% for those aged 65 years and older. The overall prevalence rate for Alzheimer's disease (AD) in the population was 0.25%  and 1.5% for those aged 65 years and above. AD (n = 62; 65%) was the most common cause of dementia followed byvascular dementia (n = 23; 22%). There were more women (n = 38) than men (n = 24) in the AD group. Increasing age was associated with a higher prevalence of the dementia syndrome in general as well as AD specifically. CONCLUSION: In the population surveyed  the prevalence of AD and other dementias is less than that reported from developed countries but similar to results of other studies in India.

A group of 48 subjects meeting criteria for aMCI and 36 age-matched control subjects were assessed using a comprehensive battery of standardized neuropsychological tests and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The ACE gene's I/D polymorphism was analyzed by means of PCR  and serum ACE concentrations were measured using ultraviolet spectrophotometry. Genotype effects on neuropsychological domains and MRI gray matter volume (GMV) measurements (optimized voxel-based morphometry) were examined using general linear models. The D carriers among the aMCI subjects performed significantly worse on AVLT-delayed recall compared to the I homozygous group. The D carriers had higher serum ACE concentrations than did the I homozygous carriers  though this difference only reached statistical significance in the aMCI group. Compared with the I homozygous carriers  in the aMCI group  D carriers showed smaller GMV of the bilateral middle frontal gyrus  right cuneus  right precentral gyrus  right medial frontal gyrus  right superior frontal gyrus  and left postcentral gyrus. However  there was no significant difference in GMV between I homozygous and D carriers in the normal control group.

64028,Comparison of different methodological implementations of voxel-based morphometry in neurodegenerative disease.,Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) is a popular method for probing inter-group differences in brain morphology. Variation in the detailed implementation of the algorithm  however  will affect the apparent results of VBM analyses and in turn the inferences drawn about the anatomic expression of specific disease states. We qualitatively assessed group comparisons of 43 normal elderly control subjects and 51 patients with probable Alzheimer's disease  using five different VBM variations.

Given the absence of a current vaccine or specific antiviral treatment, it is urgent to search for FDA-approved drugs that can potentially inhibit essential viral enzymes. The inhibition of 3CLpro has potential medical application, due to the fact that it is required for processing of the first translated replicase polyproteins into a series of native proteins, which are essential for viral replication in the host cell. We employed an in silico approach to test if disulfiram, as well as its metabolites, and captopril could be used as potential antiviral drugs against COVID-19.

17724,Structure analysis of the receptor binding of 2019-nCoV,"2019-nCoV is a newly identified coronavirus with high similarity to SARS-CoV. We performed a structural analysis of the receptor binding domain (RBD) of spike glycoprotein responsible for entry of coronaviruses into host cells. The RBDs from the two viruses share 72% identity in amino acid sequences, and molecular simulation reveals highly similar ternary structures. However, 2019-nCoV has a distinct loop with flexible glycyl residues replacing rigid prolyl residues in SARS-CoV. Molecular modeling revealed that 2019-nCoV RBD has a stronger interaction with angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). A unique phenylalanine F486 in the flexible loop likely plays a major role because its penetration into a deep hydrophobic pocket in ACE2. ACE2 is widely expressed with conserved primary structures throughout the animal kingdom from fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, to mammals. Structural analysis suggests that ACE2 from these animals can potentially bind RBD of 2019-nCoV, making them all possible natural hosts for the virus. 2019-nCoV is thought to be transmitted through respiratory droplets. However, since ACE2 is predominantly expressed in intestines, testis, and kidney, fecal-oral and other routes of transmission are also possible. Finally, antibodies and small molecular inhibitors that can block the interaction of ACE2 with RBD should be developed to combat the virus. Copyright ÁE© 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

31699,Corpus callosum shape changes in early Alzheimer's disease: an MRI study using the OASIS brain database.,The corpus callosum (CC) is the largest fiber bundle connecting the left and right cerebral hemispheres. It has been a region examined extensively for indications of various pathologies  including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Almost all previous studies of the CC in AD have been concerned with its size  particularly its mid-sagittal cross-sectional area (CCA). In this study  we show that the CC shape  characterized by its circularity (CIR)  may be affected more profoundly than its size in early AD. MRI scans (n = 196) were obtained from the publicly available Open Access Series of Imaging Studies database. The CC cross-sectional region on the mid-sagittal section of the brain was automatically segmented using a novel algorithm. The CCA and CIR were compared in 98 normal controls (NC) subjects  70 patients with very mild AD (AD-VM)  and 28 patients with mild AD (AD-M). Statistical analysis of covariance controlling for age and intracranial capacity showed that both the CIR and the CCA were significantly reduced in the AD-VM group relative to the NC group (CIR: p = 0.004; CCA: p = 0.005). However  only the CIR was significantly different between the AD-M and AD-VM groups (p = 0.006) being smaller in the former. The CCA was not significantly different between the AD-M and AD-VM groups. The results suggest that CC shape may be a more sensitive marker than its size for monitoring the progression of AD. In order to facilitate independent analyses  the CC segmentations and the CCA and CIR data used in this study have been made publicly available (http://www.nitrc.org/projects/art).,0,Corpus callosum shape changes in early Alzheimer's disease: an MRI study using the OASIS brain database.The corpus callosum (CC) is the largest fiber bundle connecting the left and right cerebral hemispheres.

49846,Low testosterone levels predict clinical adverse outcomes in SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia patients,"BACKGROUND: The pandemic of new severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) due to coronavirus (CoV) 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has stressed the importance of effective diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers of clinical worsening and mortality. Epidemiological data showing a differential impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on women and men has suggested a potential role for testosterone (T) in determining gender-disparity in the SARS-CoV-2 clinical outcomes. OBJECTIVES: To estimate the association between T level and SARS-CoV-2 clinical outcomes (defined as conditions requiring transfer to higher or lower intensity of care or death) in a cohort of patients admitted in the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit (RICU) MATERIALS AND METHODS: A consecutive series of 31 male patients affected by SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia and recovered in the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit (RICU) of the ""Carlo Poma"" Hospital in Mantua were analyzed. Several biochemical risk factors (i.e., blood count and leucocyte formula, C- Reactive Protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), Lactic Dehydrogenase (LDH), Ferritin, D-Dimer, Fibrinogen, Interleukin 6 (IL-6)) as well as total testosterone (TT), calculated free T (cFT), Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG), and Luteinizing Hormone (LH) were determined. RESULTS: Lower TT and cFT were found in the transferred to ICU/deceased in RICU group vs. groups of patients transferred to IM or maintained in the RICU in stable condition. Both TT and cFT showed a negative significant correlation with biochemical risk factors (i.e. the neutrophil count, LDH and PCT) but a positive association with the lymphocyte count. Likewise, TT was also negatively associated with CRP and ferritin levels. A steep increase of both ICU transfer or mortality risk was observed in men with TT<5 nmol/L or cFT< 100 pmol/L. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates for the first time that lower baseline levels of TT and cFT levels predict poor prognosis and mortality in SARS-CoV-2 infected men admitted to RICU.

24741,Neuropsychological correlates of hippocampal atrophy in memory testing in nondemented older adults.,BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Cognitive deficits in older adults attributable to Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology are featured early on by hippocampal impairment. Among tests used to evaluate memory  verbal memory tests with controlled encoding and cued recall are believed to be specific for hippocampal impairment. The objective of this study was to assess the relation between left and right hippocampal volumes and several frequently used memory tests. METHODS: Fifty six nondemented older adults (30 with amnestic mild cognitive impairment and 26 cognitively healthy older adults) underwent neuropsychological testing including: (1) The Enhanced Cued Recall test (ECR)  a memory test with controlled encoding and recall; (2) the Auditory Verbal Learning Test (AVLT)  a verbal memory test without controlled encoding and with delayed recall; and (3) The Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure test (ROCF)  a visuospatial memory test-recall condition. 1.5T brain MRI scans were used to measure estimated total intracranial volume (eTIV) along with hippocampal right and left volumes  which were measured with quantitative volumetry using FreeSurfer package (version 4.4.0). Spearman partial correlation controlled for age was used to correct for non-normal score distribution and effect of age. RESULTS: We found moderate correlations of hippocampal volumes with AVLT 1-5 scores  AVLT delayed recall  ECR free and total recall  and ROCF reproduction. Total recall in ECR using cued recall was not superior to any of the free recall tests. No correlation in any memory test was achieved with eTIV.

56663,Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome: utility of fluid-attenuated inversion recovery MR imaging in the detection of cortical and subcortical lesions.,BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is typically characterized by headache  altered mental functioning  seizures  and visual loss associated with imaging findings of bilateral subcortical and cortical edema with a predominantly posterior distribution. Our goal was to determine whether fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging improves the ability to detect subtle peripheral lesions of PRES  as compared with conventional MR techniques. METHODS: Sixteen patients with clinical and imaging findings consistent with PRES were studied. Thirteen patients had undergone transplantation and had cyclosporin A neurotoxicity. Fast-FLAIR images were compared with spin-echo proton density- and T2-weighted images. RESULTS: FLAIR imaging improved diagnostic confidence and conspicuity of the T2 hyperintense lesions of PRES  typically in the subcortical white matter of the parietooccipital regions bilaterally. On all 23 abnormal MR studies  FLAIR was judged superior to proton density- and T2-weighted images for the detection of PRES in the supratentorial brain. In a mean of 6.7 of 23 studies  FLAIR findings prompted a raise in the grade of disease severity. FLAIR also showed cortical involvement in 94% of patients with PRES and in a mean of 46% of the total lesion burden. In four cases  subtle lesions were virtually undetectable without FLAIR. Brain stem or cerebellar disease was encountered in 56% of patients. CONCLUSION: FLAIR improves the ability to diagnose and detect subcortical and cortical lesions in PRES as compared with proton density- and T2-weighted spin-echo images. We therefore believe that FLAIR should be performed in patients with suspected PRES to allow more confident recognition of the often subtle imaging abnormalities.,0,Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome: utility of fluid-attenuated inversion recovery MR imaging in the detection of cortical and subcortical lesions.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is typically characterized by headache  altered mental functioning  seizures  and visual loss associated with imaging findings of bilateral subcortical and cortical edema with a predominantly posterior distribution.

7446,"Fully automated atlas-based MR imaging volumetry in Huntington disease, compared with manual volumetry.",BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The atrophy of the caudate is considered the hallmark of HD-associated neurodegeneration and has high potential as a biomarker in structural MR imaging. This study aimed at comparing automated and manual caudate volumetry. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this cross-sectional volumetric study in 40 patients with HD and 30 healthy controls  a fully automated caudate measurement by ABV was used for the first time in HD and was directly compared with manual delineation as the generally accepted criterion standard of volumetry. RESULTS: It could be shown that both techniques were able to separate patients and controls to a similar degree. The differences between the 2 volumetric measurements ranged within the limits of agreement; the systematically lower values by manual volumetry were caused by the different assessment of the dorsal caudate tail  which is hard to delineate manually. CONCLUSIONS: ABV may be used instead of manual volumetry to quantify caudate volume loss. Additionally  the ABV technique has the advantage of being much faster  is less laborious  and is free of a subjective region-of interest definition. ABV might serve as a tool in potential future clinical trials of disease-modifying treatments in HD.,0,"Fully automated atlas-based MR imaging volumetry in Huntington disease, compared with manual volumetry.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The atrophy of the caudate is considered the hallmark of HD-associated neurodegeneration and has high potential as a biomarker in structural MR imaging. This study aimed at comparing automated and manual caudate volumetry. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this cross-sectional volumetric study in 40 patients with HD and 30 healthy controls  a fully automated caudate measurement by ABV was used for the first time in HD and was directly compared with manual delineation as the generally accepted criterion standard of volumetry. RESULTS: It could be shown that both techniques were able to separate patients and controls to a similar degree. The differences between the 2 volumetric measurements ranged within the limits of agreement; the systematically lower values by manual volumetry were caused by the different assessment of the dorsal caudate tail  which is hard to delineate manually. CONCLUSIONS: ABV may be used instead of manual volumetry to quantify caudate volume loss. Additionally  the ABV technique has the advantage of being much faster  is less laborious  and is free of a subjective region-of interest definition. ABV might serve as a tool in potential future clinical trials of disease-modifying treatments in HD.","{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 994}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 994}",1,"{'judgement': 'False', 'index': 994}",0,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 994}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 994}",1

47896,A retrospective study of the initial chest CT imaging findings in 50 COVID-19 patients stratified by gender and age,"OBJECTIVE: To retrospectively analyze and stratify the initial clinical features and CT imaging findings of patients with COVID-19 by gender and age. METHODS: Data of 50 COVID-19 patients were collected in two hospitals. The clinical manifestations, laboratory examination and chest CT imaging features were analyzed, and a stratification analysis was performed according to gender and age [younger group: <50 years old, elderly group >=50 years old]. RESULTS: Most patients had a history of epidemic exposure within 2 weeks (96%). The main clinical complaints are fever (54%) and cough (46%). In chest CT images, ground-glass opacity (GGO) is the most common feature (37/38, 97%) in abnormal CT findings, with the remaining 12 patients (12/50, 24%) presenting normal CT images. Other concomitant abnormalities include dilatation of vessels in lesion (76%), interlobular thickening (47%), adjacent pleural thickening (37%), focal consolidation (26%), nodules (16%) and honeycomb pattern (13%). The lesions were distributed in the periphery (50%) or mixed (50%). Subgroup analysis showed that there was no difference in the gender distribution of all the clinical and imaging features. Laboratory findings, interlobular thickening, honeycomb pattern and nodules demonstrated remarkable difference between younger group and elderly group. The average CT score for pulmonary involvement degree was 5.0+/-4.7. Correlation analysis revealed that CT score was significantly correlated with age, body temperature and days from illness onset (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 has various clinical and imaging appearances. However, it has certain characteristics that can be stratified.
