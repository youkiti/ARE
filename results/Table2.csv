0,27405,Semi-Automated Detection of Cerebral Microbleeds on 3.0 T MR Images.,Cerebral microbleeds are associated with vascular disease and dementia. They can be detected on MRI and receive increasing attention. Visual rating is the current standard for microbleed detection  but is rater dependent  has limited reproducibility  modest sensitivity  and can be time-consuming. The goal of the current study is to present a tool for semi-automated detection of microbleeds that can assist human raters in the rating procedure. The radial symmetry transform is originally a technique to highlight circular-shaped objects in two-dimensional images. In the current study  the three-dimensional radial symmetry transform was adapted to detect spherical microbleeds in a series of 72 patients from our hospital  for whom a ground truth visual rating was made by four raters. Potential microbleeds were automatically identified on T2*-weighted 3.0 T MRI scans and the results were visually checked to identify microbleeds. Final ratings of the radial symmetry transform were compared to human ratings. After implementing and optimizing the radial symmetry transform  the method achieved a high sensitivity  while maintaining a modest number of false positives. Depending on the settings  sensitivities ranged from 65%-84% compared to the ground truth rating. Rating of the processed images required 1-2 minutes per participant  in which 20-96 false positive locations per participant were censored. Sensitivities of individual raters ranged from 39%-86% compared to the ground truth and required 5-10 minutes per participant per rater. The sensitivities that were achieved by the radial symmetry transform are similar to those of individual experienced human raters  demonstrating its feasibility and usefulness for semi-automated microbleed detection.,0,Semi-Automated Detection of Cerebral Microbleeds on 3.0 T MR Images.Cerebral microbleeds are associated with vascular disease and dementia.

The use of naturally occurring small molecules for inhibiting protein aggregation has recently attracted many interests due to their effectiveness for treating protein folding diseases such as AD  Parkinson's  Huntington's disease  and other amyloidosis diseases. alpha-d-Mannosylglycerate (MG)  a natural extremolyte identified in microorganisms growing under extremely high temperatures up to 100 degrees C  had been shown to protect proteins against various stress conditions such as heat  freezing  thawing  and drying. Here  we report the effectiveness of MG on the suppression of Alzheimer's Abeta aggregation and neurotoxicity to human neuroblastoma cells. According to our study--carried out by using thioflavin-T induced fluorescence  atomic force microscopy  and cell viability assay--MG had significant inhibitory effect against Abeta amyloid formation and could reduce the toxicity of amyloid aggregates to human neuroblastoma cells while MG itself was innocuous to cells. On the other hand  the structural analogs of MG such as alpha-d-mannosylglyceramide  mannose  methylmannoside  glycerol  showed negligible effect on Abeta aggregate formation. The results suggest that MG could be a potential drug candidate for treating Alzheimer's disease.,0,"Inhibition of beta-amyloid peptide aggregation and neurotoxicity by alpha-d-mannosylglycerate, a natural extremolyte.The aggregation of soluble beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptide into oligomers/fibrils is one of the key pathological features in Alzheimer's disease (AD).

3,15424,Using rapid online surveys to assess perceptions during infectious disease outbreaks: a cross-sectional survey on Covid-19 among the general public in the United States and United Kingdom,"BACKGROUND: Given the extensive time needed to conduct a nationally representative household survey and the commonly low response rate in phone surveys, rapid online surveys may be a promising method to assess and track knowledge and perceptions among the general public during fast-moving infectious disease outbreaks. OBJECTIVE: To apply rapid online surveying to determine knowledge and perceptions of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) among the general public in the United States (US) and the United Kingdom (UK). METHODS: An online questionnaire was administered to 3,000 adults residing in the US and 3,000 adults residing in the UK who had registered with Prolific Academic to participate in online research. Strata by age (18 - 27, 28 - 37, 38 - 47, 48 - 57, or >=58 years), sex (male or female), and ethnicity (White, Black or African American, Asian or Asian Indian, Mixed, or ""Other""), and all permutations of these strata, were established. The number of participants who could enrol in each of these strata was calculated to reflect the distribution in the US and UK general population. Enrolment into the survey within the strata was on a first-come, first-served basis. Participants completed the questionnaire between February 23 and March 2 2020. RESULTS: 2,986 and 2,988 adults residing in the US and the UK, respectively, completed the questionnaire. 64.4% (1,924/2,986) of US and 51.5% (1,540/2,988) of UK participants had a tertiary education degree. 67.5% (2,015/2,986) of US participants had a total household income between $20,000 and $99,999, and 74.4% (2,223/2,988) of UK participants had a total household income between GBP15,000 and GBP74,999. US and UK participants' median estimate for the probability of a fatal disease course among those infected with SARS-CoV-2 was 5.0% (IQR: 2.0% - 15.0%) and 3.0% (IQR: 2.0% - 10.0%), respectively. Participants generally had good knowledge of the main mode of disease transmission and common symptoms of Covid-19. However, a substantial proportion of participants had misconceptions about how to prevent an infection and the recommended care-seeking behavior. For instance, 37.8% (95% CI: 36.1% - 39.6%) of US and 29.7% (95% CI: 28.1% - 31.4%) of UK participants thought that wearing a common surgical mask was 'highly effective' in protecting them from acquiring Covid-19. 25.6% (95% CI: 24.1% - 27.2%) of US and 29.6% (95% CI: 28.0% - 31.3%) of UK participants thought it prudent to refrain from eating at Chinese restaurants. Around half (53.8% [95% CI: 52.1% - 55.6%] of US and 39.1% [95% CI: 37.4% - 40.9%] of UK participants) thought that children were at an especially high risk of death when infected with SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSIONS: The distribution of participants by total household income and education followed approximately that of the general population. The findings from this online survey could guide information campaigns by public health authorities, clinicians, and the media. More broadly, rapid online surveys could be an important tool in tracking the public's knowledge and misperceptions during rapidly moving infectious disease outbreaks.",0,"Using rapid online surveys to assess perceptions during infectious disease outbreaks: a cross-sectional survey on Covid-19 among the general public in the United States and United KingdomBACKGROUND: Given the extensive time needed to conduct a nationally representative household survey and the commonly low response rate in phone surveys, rapid online surveys may be a promising method to assess and track knowledge and perceptions among the general public during fast-moving infectious disease outbreaks.

Quality assessment using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) showed a mean score of 7.5 +/- 1.06, indicating moderate to high quality of the studies. Three retrospective cohort studies reported a reduction in the mortality rate, while 6 other studies showed no mortality benefits among patients with COVID-19 treated with therapeutic-dose anticoagulation. There was a slight tendency toward a reduction in the mortality rate among mechanically-ventilated patients with COVID-19 receiving therapeutic-dose anticoagulation. Bleeding events and thrombotic complications among patients receiving therapeutic-dose anticoagulation were reported in 3 studies.

To this end  cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of tau (total tau) and the light subtype of the neurofilament proteins (NFL) were studied in patients with FTD (n=16) and in age-matched controls (n=16). In addition  serum was analysed for IgG and IgM antibodies to the most common gangliosides and sulfatide in FTD patients (n=13) and in age-matched controls (n=20). The CSF-NFL levels were increased in FTD (1606+/-1151 pg/ml  mean+/-S.D.; P<0.001) compared with controls (308+/-203 pg/ml)  whereas the CSF-tau levels were normal. In serum  autoantibody IgG-GA1 was significantly increased in FTD (P<0.05) compared with controls. No correlations were found between the effect parameters and demographic variables in any group.

7,24526,The leukocyte expression of CD36 is low in patients with Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment.,CD36  a scavenger receptor of class B (SR-B)  helps mediate microglial and macrophage response to beta-amyloid fibrils (betaA)  and seems to play a key role in the proinflammatory events associated with Alzheimer disease (AD) in many tissues. Peripheral leukocytes express many molecules and multiple receptors which undergo the same regulatory mechanisms as those operative in the brain. Thus  these cells  easily obtainable through peripheral blood sampling  may be used as a tool to investigate changes occurring in inaccessible brain areas. Based on these premises  we investigated the leukocyte expression of CD36 in 70 AD patients and in 30 subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Results were compared to those of 20 young and 40 age-matched control subjects. Leukocyte expression of CD36 was significantly reduced versus controls in both AD and MCI patients  while in young and old controls there were no age-related changes. Although preliminary  these data indicate that the reduction of CD36 expression in leukocytes is a disease-related phenomenon  occurring since the early stages of AD (MCI).

9,59803,Employing Alzheimer disease animal models for translational research: focus on dietary components.,BACKGROUND: Translational research needs valid animal models of disease to discover new pathogenetic aspects and treatments. In Alzheimer's disease (AD)  transgenic models are of great value for AD research and drug testing.

METHODS: TgCRND8 mice (3.5 months old)  expressing the mutant KM670/671NL+V717F h-ﾎｲAPP695 transgene  and wild-type (wt) mice were used to study in vivo the effects of an 8-week dietary supplementation with OLE (50 mg/kg of diet) [Grossi et al: PLoS One 2013;8:e71702]  following the European Communities Council Directive 86/609 (DL 116/92) and National Guidelines (permit number: 283/2012-B). RESULTS: OLE administration ameliorates memory dysfunction  raises a significant autophagic response in the cortex and promotes the proliferation of newborn cells in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support the beneficial effects of EVOO and highlight the possibility that continuous intake of high doses of OLE  both as a nutraceutical or as a food integrator  may prevent/delay the appearance of AD and reduce the severity of its symptoms.,0,Employing Alzheimer disease animal models for translational research: focus on dietary components.BACKGROUND: Translational research needs valid animal models of disease to discover new pathogenetic aspects and treatments.

10,21516,Setting up an integrated service for PSC-IBD patients: A quality improvement project,"Introduction Primary sclerosing cholangitis(PSC) is a chronic inflammatory condition closely associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and characterised by progressive fibrosis of biliary tract leading to cirrhosis and its complications. There is an appreciable annual risk of cholangiocarcinoma(CCA), gall-bladder carcinoma, colorectal cancer(CRC) and hepatocellular cancer. Annual surveillance with magnetic resonance cholangio-pancreatography(MRCP), colonoscopy, ultrasound(US) (6 monthly if cirrhotic) is advised. We aimed to assess the quality of liver and bowel surveillance, and detection of complications, before and after the introduction of an integrated hepatology and IBD service. Methods Retrospective data on management of PSC/IBD patients at St Thomas' hospital, a tertiary IBD and hepatology centre, prior the introduction of an integrated service (August 2016) and prospective data following its introduction. Results Retrospective data identified 29 patients with IBD-PSC. Annual MRCP was performed in 55.1% (16/29), colonoscopy in 55.1% (16/2, 48% having chromoendoscopy) and US in 7%. 51% (15/29) were not under joint IBD and hepatology service. This indicated significant variability in care and poor adherence to guidelines. Interventions: Reiteration to physicians at every IBD clinic to actively identify PSC-IBD patients. Prospective database maintained. PSC-IBD patients were discussed in hepatology and IBD multidisciplinary meetings(MDM) regularly and surveillance arranged. A joint PSC/IBD clinic was established for this cohort. Following these interventions, 47 PSC-IBD patients (64% male, mean age 47 years) (33 UC, 11 Crohn's, 3 IBD-U) were identified. To date, 38 have been seen in joint PSC/IBD clinic, 45 have been reviewed in MDM and annual surveillance has improved to 91% with MRCP(p<0.01), 86% with colono-scopy(p<0.01), 74% with chromoendoscopy(p = 0.03), 91% with MRI liver (instead of US). 49% (22/45) had a change in management following MDM discussion. Improvement in management and surveillance LED to diagnosis and appropriate treatment of 1 CCA, 2 PSC with autoimmune overlap, 3 small duct PSC, 4 patients with dysplastic polyps as well as 2 new cases of CRC and 1 case of multifocal dysplasia which resulted 3 colectomies.

There is an appreciable annual risk of cholangiocarcinoma(CCA), gall-bladder carcinoma, colorectal cancer(CRC) and hepatocellular cancer. Annual surveillance with magnetic resonance cholangio-pancreatography(MRCP), colonoscopy, ultrasound(US) (6 monthly if cirrhotic) is advised. We aimed to assess the quality of liver and bowel surveillance, and detection of complications, before and after the introduction of an integrated hepatology and IBD service.

11,67454,"Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest during the COVID-19 pandemic in Paris, France: a population-based, observational study","BACKGROUND: Although mortality due to COVID-19 is, for the most part, robustly tracked, its indirect effect at the population level through lockdown, lifestyle changes, and reorganisation of health-care systems has not been evaluated. We aimed to assess the incidence and outcomes of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) in an urban region during the pandemic, compared with non-pandemic periods. METHODS: We did a population-based, observational study using data for non-traumatic OHCA (N=30 768), systematically collected since May 15, 2011, in Paris and its suburbs, France, using the Paris Fire Brigade database, together with in-hospital data. We evaluated OHCA incidence and outcomes over a 6-week period during the pandemic in adult inhabitants of the study area. FINDINGS: Comparing the 521 OHCAs of the pandemic period (March 16 to April 26, 2020) to the mean of the 3052 total of the same weeks in the non-pandemic period (weeks 12-17, 2012-19), the maximum weekly OHCA incidence increased from 13.42 (95% CI 12.77-14.07) to 26.64 (25.72-27.53) per million inhabitants (p<0.0001), before returning to normal in the final weeks of the pandemic period. Although patient demographics did not change substantially during the pandemic compared with the non-pandemic period (mean age 69.7 years [SD 17] vs 68.5 [18], 334 males [64.4%] vs 1826 [59.9%]), there was a higher rate of OHCA at home (460 [90.2%] vs 2336 [76.8%]; p<0.0001), less bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (239 [47.8%] vs 1165 [63.9%]; p<0.0001) and shockable rhythm (46 [9.2%] vs 472 [19.1%]; p<0.0001), and longer delays to intervention (median 10.4 min [IQR 8.4-13.8] vs 9.4 min [7.9-12.6]; p<0.0001). The proportion of patients who had an OHCA and were admitted alive decreased from 22.8% to 12.8% (p<0.0001) in the pandemic period. After adjustment for potential confounders, the pandemic period remained significantly associated with lower survival rate at hospital admission (odds ratio 0.36, 95% CI 0.24-0.52; p<0.0001). COVID-19 infection, confirmed or suspected, accounted for approximately a third of the increase in OHCA incidence during the pandemic. INTERPRETATION: A transient two-times increase in OHCA incidence, coupled with a reduction in survival, was observed during the specified time period of the pandemic when compared with the equivalent time period in previous years with no pandemic. Although this result might be partly related to COVID-19 infections, indirect effects associated with lockdown and adjustment of health-care services to the pandemic are probable. Therefore, these factors should be taken into account when considering mortality data and public health strategies. FUNDING: The French National Institute of Health and Medical Research (INSERM).

12,24720,Colonic lymphoma presenting acutely with perforated colo-splenic fistula,"INTRODUCTION: Primary colonic lymphoma is rare. It comprises less than 1% of large bowel malignancies. Affected patients of ten present with non-specific vague symptoms with subsequent delays in diagnosis and management. PRESENTATION OF CASE: An immuno-competent 35-year-old male presented with left iliac fossa pain, fever and constipation. Clinical examination revealed left-sided abdominal peritonism. After the initial radiological and endoscopic investigations, a provisional diagnosis of a localized perforation of a splenic flexure diverticulum was made and ultrasound-guided percutaneous drainage of the abscess was performed. The patient failed to settle on conservative treatment and therefore exploratory laparotomy was carried out. An inflammatory phlegmon consisting of a left paracolic gutter abscess, the spleen and the splenic flexure of the colon was resected en-bloc and a primary colo-colic anastomosis was performed. His operative recovery was complicated by wound infection which was treated conservatively. The histopathology revealed colo-splenic fistula secondary to a perforated colonic non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The spleen contained multiple metastatic lymphomatous deposits. He was started on chemotherapy and remained well at 5-year follow up. DISCUSSION: Colon non-Hodgkin's lymphoma may present initially with an acute abdomen due to perforation. It mimics any acute surgical condition. Perforation and fistulaization into the spleen is very rare. CONCLUSION: This case highlights the delay and difficulty in diagnosing primary colonic lymphoma without resorting to surgical resection. ﾂｩ 2012 Surgical Associates Ltd. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Moreover  missense changes in PGRN were identified in patients with motor neuron degeneration  a condition that is related to FTLD. Most mutations identified in patients with FTLD until now have been null mutations. However  it remains unknown whether PGRN protein levels are reduced in the central nervous system from such patients. The effects of PGRN on neurons also remain to be established. We report that PGRN levels are reduced in the cerebrospinal fluid from FTLD patients carrying a PGRN mutation. We observe that PGRN and GRN E (one of the proteolytic fragments of PGRN) promote neuronal survival and enhance neurite outgrowth in cultured neurons. These results demonstrate that PGRN/GRN is a neurotrophic factor with activities that may be involved in the development of the nervous system and in neurodegeneration.,0,Progranulin functions as a neurotrophic factor to regulate neurite outgrowth and enhance neuronal survival.Recently  mutations in the progranulin (PGRN) gene were found to cause familial and apparently sporadic frontotemporal lobe dementia (FTLD).

16,35723,Three subsystems of the inferior parietal cortex are differently affected in mild cognitive impairment.,The Inferior parietal cortex (IPC)  including the intraparietal sulcus (IPS)  angular gyrus (AG)  and supramarginal gyrus (SG)  plays an important role in episodic memory  and is considered to be one of the specific neuroimaging markers in predicting the conversion of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer's disease (AD). However  it is still unclear whether the connectivity of the IPC is impaired in MCI patients. In the present study  we used resting state fMRI to examine the functional connectivity of the three subdivisions of the IPC in MCI patients after controlling the impact of regional grey matter atrophy. It was found that  using IPS  AG  and SG as seeds of functional connectivity  three canonical functional networks could be correspondingly traced  i.e.  executive control network (ECN)  default mode network (DMN)  and salience network (SN)  and the three networks are differently altered in MCI patients. In contrast to the healthy controls  it was found that in MCI patients: 1) AG connectivity was significantly reduced within the DMN; 2) IPS showed decreased connectivity with the right inferior frontal gyrus while showing increased connectivity with the left frontal regions within the ECN; and 3) SG displayed decreased connectivity with a distribution of regions including the frontal and parietal regions  and increased connectivity with some sub-cortical areas within the SN. Moreover  the connectivity within the three networks was correlated with episodic memory and general cognitive impairment in MCI patients. These results extend well beyond the DMN  and further suggest that MCI is associated with alteration of large-scale functional brain networks.,0,Three subsystems of the inferior parietal cortex are differently affected in mild cognitive impairment.The Inferior parietal cortex (IPC)  including the intraparietal sulcus (IPS)  angular gyrus (AG)  and supramarginal gyrus (SG)  plays an important role in episodic memory  and is considered to be one of the specific neuroimaging markers in predicting the conversion of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer's disease (AD).

Self-induced sputum in those with a productive cough, and saliva in those without a productive cough have been proposed, but sensitivity remains uncertain. METHODS: We performed a prospective study in two regional hospitals in Hong Kong. RESULTS: We prospectively examined 563 serial samples collected during the virus shedding periods of 50 patients: 150 deep-throat saliva (DTS), 309 pooled-nasopharyngeal (NP) and throat swabs, and 104 sputum. DTS had the lowest overall RT-PCR positive rate (68.7% vs. 89.4% [sputum] and 80.9% [pooled NP and throat swabs]), and the lowest viral RNA concentration (mean log copy/mL 3.54 vs. 5.03 [sputum] and 4.63 [pooled NP and throat swabs]). Analyses with respect to time from symptom onset and severity also revealed similar results. Virus yield of DTS correlated with that of sputum (Pearson correlation index [95% CI]: 0.76 [0.62 - 0.86]). We estimated the overall false-negative rate of DTS could be 31.3%, and increased 2.7 times among patients without sputum. CONCLUSION: DTS produced the lowest viral RNA concentration and RT-PCR positive rate compared to conventional respiratory specimens in all phases of illness.

Systematic observations of pleasure in the natural environment were conducted using Lawton's Modified Behavior Stream. Analysis showed that pleasure is related to stimulus category  personal attributes and environmental conditions. In the multivariate analyses  all types of social stimuli (live and simulated  human and nonhuman)  self-identity stimuli  and music were related to significantly higher levels of pleasure than the control condition. Females and persons with higher ADL and communication functional status exhibited more pleasure. Pleasure was most likely to occur in environments with moderate noise levels. These results demonstrate that these nursing home residents are indeed capable of showing pleasure. Caregivers of nursing home residents with dementia should incorporate social  self-identity  and music stimuli into their residents' care plans so that eliciting pleasure from each resident becomes the norm rather than a random occurrence.,0,What affects pleasure in persons with advanced stage dementia?We examined the impact of environmental  person  and stimulus characteristics on pleasure in persons with dementia.

19,14736,Functional brain networks and cognitive deficits in Parkinson's disease.,Graph-theoretical analyses of functional networks obtained with resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have recently proven to be a useful approach for the study of the substrates underlying cognitive deficits in different diseases. We used this technique to investigate whether cognitive deficits in Parkinson's disease (PD) are associated with changes in global and local network measures. Thirty-six healthy controls (HC) and 66 PD patients matched for age  sex  and education were classified as having mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or not based on performance in the three mainly affected cognitive domains in PD: attention/executive  visuospatial/visuoperceptual (VS/VP)  and declarative memory. Resting-state fMRI and graph theory analyses were used to evaluate network measures. We have found that patients with MCI had connectivity reductions predominantly affecting long-range connections as well as increased local interconnectedness manifested as higher measures of clustering  small-worldness  and modularity. The latter measures also tended to correlate negatively with cognitive performance in VS/VP and memory functions. Hub structure was also reorganized: normal hubs displayed reduced centrality and degree in MCI PD patients. Our study indicates that the topological properties of brain networks are changed in PD patients with cognitive deficits. Our findings provide novel data regarding the functional substrate of cognitive impairment in PD  which may prove to have value as a prognostic marker.,0,Functional brain networks and cognitive deficits in Parkinson's disease.Graph-theoretical analyses of functional networks obtained with resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have recently proven to be a useful approach for the study of the substrates underlying cognitive deficits in different diseases.

20,19887,Neuroimaging markers of human immunodeficiency virus infection in South Africa.,Previous studies have reported cognitive deficits among HIV-positive individuals infected with clade C virus. However  no study has examined whether individuals predominately infected with clade C virus exhibit brain atrophy relative to healthy controls. This study examined volumetric differences between 28 HIV+ individuals and 23 HIV- controls from South Africa. Volumetric measures were obtained from six regions of interest -- caudate  thalamus  corpus callosum  total cortex  total gray matter  and total white matter.

22,29449,Clinical and Cardiac Characteristics of COVID-19 Mortalities in a Diverse New York City Cohort,"INTRODUCTION: Electrocardiographic characteristics in COVID-19 related mortality have not yet been reported, particularly in racial/ethnic minorities. METHODS AND RESULTS: We reviewed demographics, laboratory and cardiac tests, medications, and cardiac rhythm proximate to death or initiation of comfort care for patients hospitalized with a positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR in 3 New York City hospitals between March 1 and April 3, 2020 who died. We described clinical characteristics and compared factors contributing toward arrhythmic versus non-arrhythmic death. Of 1258 patients screened, 133 died and were enrolled. Of these, 55.6% (74/133) were male, 69.9% (93/133) were racial/ethnic minorities, and 88.0% (117/133) had cardiovascular disease (CVD). The last cardiac rhythm recorded was ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation in 5.3% (7/133), pulseless electrical activity in 7.5% (10/133), unspecified bradycardia in 0.8% (1/133), and asystole in 26.3% (35/133). Most 74.4% (99/133) died receiving comfort measures only. The most common abnormalities on admission electrocardiogram included abnormal QRS axis (25.8%), atrial fibrillation/flutter (14.3%), atrial ectopy (12.0%), and right bundle branch block (11.9%). During hospitalization, an additional 17.6% developed atrial ectopy, 14.7% ventricular ectopy, 10.1% atrial fibrillation/flutter, and 7.8% a right ventricular abnormality. Arrhythmic death was confirmed or suspected in 8.3% (11/133) associated with age, coronary artery disease, asthma, vasopressor use, longer admission corrected QT interval, and left bundle branch block (LBBB). CONCLUSIONS: Conduction, rhythm, and electrocardiographic abnormalities were common during COVID-19 related hospitalization. Arrhythmic death was associated with age, coronary artery disease, asthma, longer admission corrected QT interval, LBBB, ventricular ectopy, and usage of vasopressors.

23,25909,New development of functional neurorehabilitation in neurosurgery,OBJECTIVES: Today  increasingly more patients with severe brain and spinal cord lesions mainly secondary to accidents  violence  stroke  and tumours survive their injuries  in many cases  however  suffering from severe functional impairments of functioning as described by the WHO-ICF criteria. New developments of functional neurorehabilitation in neurosurgery could significantly improve the patients' quality of life (QoL) in terms of brain and body functioning and certain health-related components of well-being (such as social activities and leisure). METHODS: Functional rehabilitation is an original task of neurosurgery from the very outset. Advances in biotechnology regarding both basic research and clinical application have opened up a new and very promising field to restore or compensate impaired or definitively lost organic functions in addition to the conservative rehabilitation methods. RESULTS: Along with the scientific progress in biotechnology and functional MRI and PET  neurosurgeons have become increasingly interested and actively involved in rehabilitation science and neurosurgical re-engineering of the damaged brain and spinal cord. Some of them have developed new specially designed institutions for early (acute) and subacute neurorehabilitation. Attached to the acute services  neurosurgeons thus become responsible for neurorehabilitation and at the same time for the management of all kinds of complications  which significantly improves the early and late functional outcome. At the same time microelectronics  biotechnology  and genetic engineering are being introduced into the field of neurosurgical rehabilitation in a step-by-step manner. DISCUSSION: Progress in the fields of microelectronics  computer technology  and genetic engineering along with rehabilitation science is opening up a new field of unknown chances to partially restore lost body functions and to help improve the quality of life of disabled patients in the sense of ICF. Functional neurosurgery plays a major role in neurosurgical rehabilitation. e.g. functional electrostimulation  brain-stem implants  pain and epilepsy control  restoration of locomotion and grasp faculties  and the use of potent substances such as botulinum toxin (Btx). This demands the capacity of time work and the realization of the necessity to draw up a detailed plan for the restoration of impaired functions prior to enacting a neurosurgical intervention in the sense of a complex neurorehabilitation  and consequently to assume the responsibility for the patient's outcome. From the beginning of neurological surgery  the preservation and restoration of impaired brain and spinal-cord functions as an original task for neurosurgeons demand their involvement with issues of functional neurorehabilitation including neurosurgical re-engineering of the damaged brain and spinal cord. In this connection the close and trusting cooperation with the clinical neuropsychologist from the very outset is an indispensible factor,0,New development of functional neurorehabilitation in neurosurgeryOBJECTIVES: Today  increasingly more patients with severe brain and spinal cord lesions mainly secondary to accidents  violence  stroke  and tumours survive their injuries  in many cases  however  suffering from severe functional impairments of functioning as described by the WHO-ICF criteria.

25,61400,Cranial neuronavigation with direct integration of (11)C methionine positron emission tomography (PET) data -- results of a pilot study in 32 surgical cases,BACKGROUND: MRI detects small intracranial lesions  but has difficulties in differentiating between tumour  gliosis and edema. (11)C methionine-PET may help to overcome this problem. For its appropriate intra-operative use  it must be integrated into neuronavigation. We present the results of our pilot study with this method. METHOD: 32 patients with 34 intracranial lesions detected by MRI underwent additional (11)C methionine-PET  because the pathophysiological behaviour or the tumour delineation was unclear. All lesions were treated surgically. In 25 patients PET data could be integrated directly into cranial neuronavigation. FINDINGS: (11)C methionine uptake was observed in 27/34 lesions  26 of them were tumours: 14 malignant and 7 benign gliomas  3 gliomas without further histological typing  one Ewing sarcoma and one non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Only one (11)C methionine positive lesion was non-tumourous: it was staged as post-irradiation necrosis in a patient operated on for a malignant glioma. 3/7 (11)C-methionine negative lesions were classified as gliosis (n=2) and M. Whipple (n=1)  but 4/7 were tumours: 2 astrocytomas WHO(degrees)II  1 DNT and one astrocytoma WHO(degrees)III. The sensitivity of (11)C methionine-PET was 87%  the specificity 75%  the positive predictive value 96% and the negative predictive value 43%. In all tumourous cases with positive tracer uptake the borderline area of the tumour was better defined by (11)C methionine-PET than by MRI. INTERPRETATION: A positive (11)C methionine-PET is highly suspicious of a tumour  a negative one does not exclude it. (11)C methionine-PET seems to be more sensitive than MRI for differentiating between tumour and edema or gliosis.

28,293,A Comparison of Case Fatality Risk of COVID-19 between Singapore and Japan,"The crude case fatality risk (CFR) for coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Singapore is remarkably small. We aimed to estimate the unbiased CFR by age for Singapore and Japan and compare these estimates by calculating the standardized mortality ratio (SMR). Age-specific CFRs for COVID-19 were estimated in real time, adjusting for the delay from illness onset to death. The SMR in Japan was estimated by using the age distribution of the Singapore population. Among cases aged 60-69 years and 70-79 years, the age-specific CFRs in Singapore were estimated as 1.84% (95% confidence interval: 0.46-4.72%) and 5.57% (1.41-13.97%), respectively, and those in Japan as 5.52% (4.55-6.62%) and 15.49% (13.81-17.27%), respectively. The SMR of COVID-19 in Japan, when compared with Singapore as the baseline, was estimated to be 1.46 (1.09-2.96). The overall CFR for Singapore is lower than that for Japan. It is possible that the circulating variant of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Singapore causes a milder clinical course of COVID-19 infection compared with other strains.

Of all tested VHH  ni3A showed highest transmigration efficiency which is  in part  facilitated by a three amino acid substitutions in its N-terminal domain. Additional studies indicated that the mechanism of transcellular passage of ni3A is by active transport. As VHH ni3A combines the ability to recognize amyloid beta and to cross the BBB  it has potential as a tool for non-invasive in vivo imaging and as efficient local drug targeting moiety in patients suffering from cerebral amyloidosis such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA).,0,Transmigration of beta amyloid specific heavy chain antibody fragments across the in vitro blood-brain barrier.Previously selected amyloid beta recognizing heavy chain antibody fragments (VHH) affinity binders derived from the Camelid heavy chain antibody repertoire were tested for their propensity to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) using an established in vitro BBB co-culture system.

One-year follow-up data from 142 healthy older adults (60-91 years) confirmed the existence of estimated change from the cross-sectional analyses for all areas except 1 (caudate). The cross-sectional and the longitudinal analyses agreed well on the rank order of age effects on specific brain structures (Spearman ﾏﾂ= 0.91).

ApoE genotyping was performed using polymerase chain reaction. Sixty subjects (30 SMC  30 controls) underwent 3T MRI  which was rated by two raters blinded to the diagnosis  for periventricular (PVH) and deep white matter hyperintensities (DWMH) using the Fazekas scale. Subjective memory was assessed by asking the participant  Do you feel like your memory or thinking is becoming worse? RESULTS: Two hundred and fifteen volunteers were assessed. Ninety-six were cognitively normal (mean age 62.5 years). SMC were reported by 52/96 subjects (54%). These were compared with subjects who denied SMC. Participants with a history of depression or anxiety were more likely to have SMC (p窶=窶0.02). The frequency distribution of ApoE4 allele and CERAD scores were similar. White matter load was similar (p窶俄王窶0.47)  with a high prevalence of PVH and DWMH seen (100% and 88% of scans  respectively). CONCLUSION: Both SMC and white matter disease were common.

Ninety-six were cognitively normal (mean age 62.5 years). SMC were reported by 52/96 subjects (54%). These were compared with subjects who denied SMC. Participants with a history of depression or anxiety were more likely to have SMC (p窶=窶0.02). The frequency distribution of ApoE4 allele and CERAD scores were similar. White matter load was similar (p窶俄王窶0.47)  with a high prevalence of PVH and DWMH seen (100% and 88% of scans  respectively). CONCLUSION: Both SMC and white matter disease were common. SMC were associated with a history of depression or anxiety but not with white matter disease. Evaluation for a history of depression and anxiety in people with SMC is supported by these findings.,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 33}",1,"{'judgement': 'False', 'index': 33}",0,"{'judgement': 'False', 'index': 33}",0
34,49826,Sex Differences in Reported Adverse Drug Reactions to COVID-19 Drugs in a Global Database of Individual Case Safety Reports,"INTRODUCTION: In late 2019, a new coronavirus-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-was discovered in Wuhan, China, and the World Health Organization later declared coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) a pandemic. Numerous drugs have been repurposed and investigated for therapeutic effectiveness in the disease, including those from ""Solidarity,"" an international clinical trial (azithromycin, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, the fixed combination lopinavir/ritonavir, and remdesivir). OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to evaluate adverse drug reaction (ADR) reporting for drugs when used in the treatment of COVID-19 compared with use for other indications, specifically focussing on sex differences. METHOD: We extracted reports on COVID-19-specific treatments from the global ADR database, VigiBase, using an algorithm developed to identify reports that listed COVID-19 as the indication. The Solidarity trial drugs were included, as were any drugs reported >= 100 times. We performed a descriptive comparison of reports for the same drugs used in non-COVID-19 indications. The data lock point date was 7 June 2020. RESULTS: In total, 2573 reports were identified for drugs used in the treatment of COVID-19. In order of frequency, the most reported ADRs were electrocardiogram QT-prolonged, diarrhoea, nausea, hepatitis, and vomiting in males and diarrhoea, electrocardiogram QT-prolonged, nausea, vomiting, and upper abdominal pain in females. Other hepatic and kidney-related events were included in the top ten ADRs in males, whereas no hepatic or renal terms were reported for females. COVID-19-related reporting patterns differed from non-pandemic reporting for these drugs. CONCLUSION: Review of a global database of suspected ADR reports revealed sex differences in the reporting patterns for drugs used in the treatment of COVID-19.

35,48450,Affective self-report during the intracarotid sodium amobarbital test: group differences.,Emotional reactions are sometimes observed during the intracarotid sodium amobarbital test. For instance  euphoric/indifference reactions can be seen during right hemisphere inactivation and catastrophic reactions may accompany left hemisphere inactivation. Less dramatic changes can also be detected in affective self-report during left and right hemisphere amobarbital tests  with more negative affect reported during left hemisphere inactivation and either neutral or mildly positive affective states reported during right hemisphere inactivation. The current study not only replicated this effect  but in addition  found significant group differences. The first group (right way) showed a pattern of affective self-report during left and right amobarbital tests entirely consistent with prior findings  while a second group (wrong way) showed results that behaved in a diametrically opposite fashion. A third group (no change) showed little  if any  difference in affective self-report during left and right amobarbital tests. The major factor distinguishing the wrong way group from the other two appeared to be an asymmetrical distribution of left and right temporal lobe lesions in the former group. In contrast  the factor differentiating the right way group from the no change group appeared to be the relative degree of left hemisphere inactivation during the left hemisphere amobarbital test. The results are discussed not only in terms of their impact on theories of cerebral lateralization for emotion  but also in terms of methodological issues in this field.,0,Affective self-report during the intracarotid sodium amobarbital test: group differences.Emotional reactions are sometimes observed during the intracarotid sodium amobarbital test.

The toxic form of amyloidogenic protein oligomers are distinct and smaller than amyloid fibrils and act by disrupting membranes. Using antibodies that bind to toxic IAPP oligomers (but not IAPP monomers or fibrils) and a vaccination-based approach  we sought to establish whether IAPP toxic oligomers form intra- or extracellularly and whether vaccination to induce anti-toxic oligomer antibodies prevents IAPP-induced apoptosis in human IAPP (h-IAPP) transgenic mice. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Pancreas was sampled from two h-IAPP transgenic mouse models and examined by immunohistochemistry for toxic oligomers. The same murine models were vaccinated with toxic oligomers of Alzheimer beta protein (AbetaP(1-40)) and anti-oligomer titers  and blood glucose and islet pathology were monitored. RESULTS: Toxic oligomers were detected intracellularly in approximately 20-40% of h-IAPP transgenic beta-cells. Vaccine induced high titers of anti-h-IAPP toxic oligomers in both transgenic models  but beta-cell apoptosis was  if anything  further increased in vaccinated mice  so that neither loss of beta-cell mass nor diabetes onset was delayed. CONCLUSIONS: IAPP toxic oligomers form in h-IAPP transgenic mouse models  and anti-toxic oligomer antibodies do not prevent h-IAPP-induced beta-cell apoptosis. These data suggest that prevention of h-IAPP oligomer formation may be more useful than a vaccination-based approach in the prevention of type 2 diabetes.,0,"Toxic human islet amyloid polypeptide (h-IAPP) oligomers are intracellular, and vaccination to induce anti-toxic oligomer antibodies does not prevent h-IAPP-induced beta-cell apoptosis in h-IAPP transgenic mice.OBJECTIVE: Islets in type 2 diabetes are characterized by a deficit in beta-cells  increased beta-cell apoptosis  and islet amyloid derived from islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP).

37,32954,Regional covariance patterns of gray matter alterations in Alzheimer's disease and its replicability evaluation.,PURPOSE: To identify regional network covariance patterns of gray matter associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and to further evaluate its replicability and stability. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study applied a multivariate analytic approach based on scaled subprofile modeling (SSM) to structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data from 19 patients with AD and 19 healthy controls (HC). We further applied the derived covariance patterns to examine the replicability and stability of AD-associated covariance patterns in an independent dataset (13 AD and 14 HC) acquired with a different scanner. RESULTS: The AD-associated covariance patterns identified from SSM combined principal components mainly involved the temporal lobe and parietal lobe. The expression of covariance patterns was significantly higher in AD patients than HC (t(36) 窶=窶5.84  P窶=窶5.75E-7) and predicted the AD/HC group membership (84% sensitivity and 90% specificity). In replicability evaluation  the expression of the forward applied covariance patterns was still statistically significant and had acceptable discriminability (69% sensitivity and 71% specificity). CONCLUSION: AD patients showed regional gray matter alterations in a reliable covariance manner. The results suggest that SSM has utility for characterizing covariant features  and therefore can assist with further understanding covariance patterns of gray matter in AD based on the view of the network.,0,Regional covariance patterns of gray matter alterations in Alzheimer's disease and its replicability evaluation.PURPOSE: To identify regional network covariance patterns of gray matter associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and to further evaluate its replicability and stability.

Given the absence of implemented therapies, new analysis, diagnosis, and therapeutics are of great importance. RESULTS: Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genomes from the current outbreak reveals the presence of short persistent DNA/RNA sequences that are absent from the human genome and transcriptome (PmRAWs). For the PmRAWs with length 12, only four exist at the same location in all SARS-CoV-2. At the gene level, we found one PmRAW of size 13 at the Spike glycoprotein coding sequence. This protein is fundamental for binding in human ACE2 and further use as an entry receptor to invade target cells. Applying protein structural prediction, we localized this PmRAW at the surface of the Spike protein, providing a potential targeted vector for diagnostics and therapeutics.

Validating the CoV consensomes, we show that high confidence transcriptional targets (HCTs) of MERS, SARS1 and SARS2 infection intersect with HCTs of signaling pathway nodes with known roles in CoV infection. Among a series of novel use cases, we gather evidence for hypotheses that SARS2 infection efficiently represses E2F family HCTs encoding key drivers of DNA replication and the cell cycle; that progesterone receptor signaling antagonizes SARS2-induced inflammatory signaling in the airway epithelium; and that SARS2 HCTs are enriched for genes involved in epithelial to mesenchymal transition.

44,3917,Cognitive and neuroimaging evidence of impaired interaction between self and memory in Alzheimer's disease.,In human cognition  self and memory processes strongly interact  as evidenced by the memory advantage for self-referential materials [Self-Reference Effect (SRE) and Self-Reference Recollection Effect (SRRE)]. The current study examined this interaction at the behavioural level and its neural correlates in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Healthy older controls (HC) and AD patients performed trait-adjectives judgements either for self-relevance or for other-relevance (encoding phase). In a first experiment  the encoding and subsequent yes-no recognition phases were administrated in aﾂMagnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scanner. Brain activation as measured by functional MRI (fMRI) was examined during self-relevance judgements and anatomical images were used to search for correlation between the memory advantage for self-related items and grey matter density (GMD). In a second experiment  participants described the retrieval experience that had driven their recognition decisions (familiarity vs recollective experience). The behavioural results revealed that the SRE and SRRE were impaired in AD patients compared to HC participants. Furthermore  verbal reports revealed that the retrieval of self-related information was preferentially associated with the retrieval of contextual details  such as source memory in the HC participants  but less so in the AD patients. Our imaging findings revealed that both groups activated the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) at encoding during self-relevance judgements. However  the variable and limited memory advantage for self-related information was associated with GMD in the lateral prefrontal cortex in the AD patients  a region supporting high-order processes linking self and memory. These findings suggest that even if AD patients engage MPFC during self-referential judgements  the retrieval of self-related memories is qualitatively and quantitatively impaired in relation with altered high-order processes in the lateral PFC.,0,Cognitive and neuroimaging evidence of impaired interaction between self and memory in Alzheimer's disease.In human cognition  self and memory processes strongly interact  as evidenced by the memory advantage for self-referential materials [Self-Reference Effect (SRE) and Self-Reference Recollection Effect (SRRE)]. The current study examined this interaction at the behavioural level and its neural correlates in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Healthy older controls (HC) and AD patients performed trait-adjectives judgements either for self-relevance or for other-relevance (encoding phase). In a first experiment  the encoding and subsequent yes-no recognition phases were administrated in aﾂMagnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scanner. Brain activation as measured by functional MRI (fMRI) was examined during self-relevance judgements and anatomical images were used to search for correlation between the memory advantage for self-related items and grey matter density (GMD). In a second experiment  participants described the retrieval experience that had driven their recognition decisions (familiarity vs recollective experience). The behavioural results revealed that the SRE and SRRE were impaired in AD patients compared to HC participants. Furthermore  verbal reports revealed that the retrieval of self-related information was preferentially associated with the retrieval of contextual details  such as source memory in the HC participants  but less so in the AD patients.

Ultrasonography and computed tomography examination of the abdomen revealed a target sign in the ascending colon, which was compatible with the diagnosis of cecal intussusception. The intussusception was spontaneously resolved at that time, but it relapsed 6 mo later. The patient underwent a successful colonoscopic disinvagination; there was no evidence of neoplastic or inflammatory lesions in the colon and terminal ileum. The patient underwent laparoscopic surgery for recurring cecal intussusception. During laparoscopy, we observed an unfixed cecum on the posterior peritoneum (i.e. A mobile cecum). Thus, we performed laparoscopic appendectomy and cecopexy with a lateral peritoneal flap using a barbed wound suture device. The patient's post-operative course was uneventful, and he continued to do well without recurrence at 10 mo after surgery. Laparoscopic cecopexy using a barbed wound suture device is a simple and reliable procedure that can be the treatment of choice for recurrent cecal intussusception associated with a mobile cecum.",0,"Case of colonic intussusception secondary to mobile cecum syndrome repaired by laparoscopic cecopexy using a barbed wound suture deviceA 27-year-old man with recurrent right lower quadrant pain was admitted to our hospital.

46,26604,The morphological phenotype of beta-amyloid plaques and associated neuritic changes in Alzheimer's disease.,We have utilised laser confocal microscopy to categorise beta-amyloid plaque types that are associated with preclinical and end-stage Alzheimer's disease and to define the neurochemistry of dystrophic neurites associated with various forms of plaques. Plaques with a spherical profile were defined as either diffuse  fibrillar or dense-cored using Thioflavin S staining or immunolabelling for beta-amyloid. Confocal analysis demonstrated that fibrillar plaques had a central mass of beta-amyloid with compact spoke-like extensions leading to a confluent outer rim. Dense-cored plaques had a compacted central mass surrounded by an outer sphere of beta-amyloid. Diffuse plaques lacked a morphologically identifiable substructure  resembling a ball of homogeneous labelling. The relative proportion of diffuse  fibrillar and dense-cored plaques was 53  22 and 25% in preclinical and 31  49 and 20% in end-stage Alzheimer's disease cases  respectively. Plaque-associated dystrophic neurites in preclinical cases were immunolabeled for neurofilament proteins whereas  in end-stage cases  these abnormal neurites were variably labelled for tau and/or neurofilaments. Double labelling demonstrated that the proportion of diffuse  fibrillar and dense-cored plaques that were neuritic was 12  47 and 82% and 24  82 and 76% in preclinical and end-stage cases  respectively. Most dystrophic neurites in Alzheimer's disease cases were labelled for either neurofilaments or tau  however  confocal analysis determined that 30% of neurofilament-labelled bulb-like or elongated neurites had a core of tau immunoreactivity. These results indicate that all morphologically defined beta-amyloid plaque variants were present in both early and late stages of Alzheimer's disease. However  progression to clinical dementia was associated with both a shift to a higher proportion of fibrillar plaques that induced local neuritic alterations and a transformation of cytoskeletal proteins within associated abnormal neuronal processes.

We analyzed more than 600 AD Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) subjects  training the SVMs on the AD/CTRL dataset  and evaluating them on a trial MCI dataset. The classification performance  evaluated as the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC)  reaches AUC = (88.9 ﾂｱ .5)% in 20-fold cross-validation on the AD/CTRL dataset  when the GM is classified as a whole.

49,50792,Computer-aided detection of ischemic lesions related to subcortical vascular dementia on magnetic resonance images.,RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to develop an automated method for detection of the hyperintense ischemic lesions related to subcortical vascular dementia based on conventional magnetic resonance images (T1-weighted  T2-weighted  and fluid-attenuated inversion-recovery images [FLAIR]). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our proposed method was based on subtraction between the T1-weighted image and the FLAIR image. First  a brain region was extracted by an automated thresholding technique based on a linear discriminant analysis for a pixel value histogram. Next  for enhancement of ischemic lesions  the T1-weighted image was subtracted from the fluid-attenuated inversion-recovery image. Ischemic lesion candidates were identified using a multiple gray-level thresholding technique and a feature-based region-growing technique on the subtraction image. Finally  an artificial neural network trained with 15 image features of the ischemic candidates was used to remove false-positives. We applied our method to nine patients with vascular dementia (age range  64-94 years  mean age  69.4 years; four males and five females)  who were scanned on a 1.5-T magnetic resonance unit. RESULTS: Our method achieved a sensitivity of 90% with 4.0 false-positives per slice in detection of ischemic lesions. The overlap measure between ischemic lesion areas obtained by our method and a neuroradiologist was 60.7% on average. The ratio of ischemic lesion area to the whole brain area obtained by our method correlated with that determined by a neuroradiologist with a correlation coefficient of 0.911. CONCLUSION: Our preliminary results suggest that the proposed method may have feasibility for evaluation of the ischemic lesion area ratio.,0,Computer-aided detection of ischemic lesions related to subcortical vascular dementia on magnetic resonance images.RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to develop an automated method for detection of the hyperintense ischemic lesions related to subcortical vascular dementia based on conventional magnetic resonance images (T1-weighted  T2-weighted  and fluid-attenuated inversion-recovery images [FLAIR]).

51,39958,Primary healthcare facility preparedness for outpatient service provision during the COVID-19 pandemic in India,"BACKGROUND: Primary healthcare centers (PHCs) represent the first tier of the Indian healthcare system, provides a range of essential outpatient services to people living in the rural, suburban, and hard to reach areas. Diversion of healthcare resources for containing the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly undermined the accessibility and availability of essential health services. Under these circumstances, the preparedness of PHCs in providing safe patient-centered care for meeting the current health needs of the population and prevent further transmission of the SARS-CoV2 infection is crucial. OBJECTIVE: To determine the primary healthcare (PHC) facility preparedness towards the provision of safe outpatient services during the COVID-19 pandemic in India. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study among supervisors and managers of primary healthcare facilities attached to medical colleges and institutions in India. A list of 60 faculty involved in the management and supervision of PHCs affiliated to the community medicine departments of medical colleges and institutes across India was compiled from an accessible private organization member database. We collected the data through a rapid survey from April 24-April 30 2020 using a google-forms online digital questionnaire that evaluated preparedness parameters based on self-assessment by the participants. The preparedness domains assessed were infrastructure availability, health worker safety, and patient care. RESULTS: A total of 51 faculty responded to the survey. Each medical college/institution was having on average (SD) a total of 2.94 (1.7) PHCs under its jurisdiction. Infrastructural and infection control deficits at the PHC were reported in terms of limited physical space and queuing capacity, lack of separate entry and exit gates (49%), suboptimal ventilation (57%), and negligible airborne infection control measures (75.5%). N-95 masks were available at 26 (50.9%) sites. Infection prevention and control measures were also suboptimal with inadequate facilities for handwashing and hand hygiene reported in 23.5% and 27.4% sites, respectively. The operation of outpatient services, particularly related to maternal and child health, were significantly disrupted (p < 0.001) during the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Existing PHC facilities in India providing outpatient services are constrained in their functioning during the COVID-19 pandemic due to weak infrastructure contributing to suboptimal patient safety and infection control measures. Furthermore, there is a need for effective planning, communication, and coordination between the centralized health policymakers and health managers working at primary healthcare facilities to ensure overall preparedness during public health emergencies.

57,1350,In vivo oxidative stress in brain of Alzheimer disease transgenic mice: Requirement for methionine 35 in amyloid beta-peptide of APP.,Numerous studies have demonstrated oxidative damage in the central nervous system in subjects with Alzheimer disease and in animal models of this dementing disorder. In this study  we show that transgenic mice modeling Alzheimer disease-PDAPP mice with Swedish and Indiana mutations in the human amyloid precursor protein (APP)-develop oxidative damage in brain  including elevated levels of protein oxidation (indexed by protein carbonyls and 3-nitrotyrosine) and lipid peroxidation (indexed by protein-bound 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal). This oxidative damage requires the presence of a single methionine residue at position 35 of the amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta)  because all indices of oxidative damage in brain were completely prevented in genetically and age-matched PDAPP mice with an M631L mutation in APP. No significant differences in the levels of APP  Abeta(1-42)  and Abeta(1-40) or in the ratio Abeta(1-42)/Abeta(1-40) were found  suggesting that the loss of oxidative stress in vivo in the brain of PDAPP(M631L) mice results solely from the mutation of the Met35 residue to Leu in the Abeta peptide. However  a marked reduction in Abeta-immunoreactive plaques was observed in the M631L mice  which instead displayed small punctate areas of nonplaque immunoreactivity and a microglial response. In contrast to the requirement for Met at residue 35 of the Abeta sequence (M631 of APP) for oxidative damage  indices of spatial learning and memory were not significantly improved by the M631L substitution. Furthermore  a genetically matched line with a different mutation-PDAPP(D664A)-showed the reverse: no reduction in oxidative damage but marked improvement in memory. This is the first in vivo study to demonstrate the requirement for Abeta residue Met35 for oxidative stress in the brain of a mammalian model of Alzheimer disease. However  in this specific transgenic mouse model of AD  oxidative stress is neither required nor sufficient for memory abnormalities.,0,In vivo oxidative stress in brain of Alzheimer disease transgenic mice: Requirement for methionine 35 in amyloid beta-peptide of APP.Numerous studies have demonstrated oxidative damage in the central nervous system in subjects with Alzheimer disease and in animal models of this dementing disorder.

60,2496,Association of elevated phospho-tau levels with Alzheimer-typical 18F-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography findings in patients with mild cognitive impairment.,BACKGROUND: Mild cognitive impairment is considered to be a transitional stage between normal aging and dementia. Phosphorylated tau protein in cerebrospinal fluid and even more decrements of cerebral glucose metabolism in parietal  temporal  or cingulate regions have shown favorable specificity for the diagnosis of Alzheimer dementia and could be useful supplementary tools to determine Alzheimer pathology in early stages. METHODS: We measured cerebrospinal fluid tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 protein  cerebrospinal fluid total tau  and cerebral glucose metabolism using 18F-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography in 16 patients with mild cognitive impairment and age-matched control subjects. RESULTS: Alzheimer-typical patterns of cerebral glucose metabolism were significantly related to elevated phosphorylated tau levels (p =.009) but not to elevated total tau levels. In six of seven mild cognitive impairment patients with increased phosphorylated tau concentrations  Alzheimer disease-typical positron emission tomography patterns were found. Phosphorylated tau measurement separated patients with and without Alzheimer disease-typical positron emission tomography findings with a sensitivity of 85.7% and a specificity of 88.9%. CONCLUSIONS: Unlike total tau levels  elevated phosphorylated tau levels were strictly related to Alzheimer-typical patterns of cerebral glucose metabolism in mild cognitive impairment patients. The results can be interpreted as validation of phosphorylated tau measurements for detecting Alzheimer disease in mild cognitive impairment patients.,0,Association of elevated phospho-tau levels with Alzheimer-typical 18F-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography findings in patients with mild cognitive impairment.BACKGROUND: Mild cognitive impairment is considered to be a transitional stage between normal aging and dementia.

61,3173,The impact of COVID-19 on neurosurgeons and the strategy for triaging non-emergent operations: a global neurosurgery study,"OBJECT: The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted all aspects of society globally. As healthcare resources had to be preserved for infected patients, and the risk of in-hospital procedures escalated for uninfected patients and staff, neurosurgeons around the world have had to postpone non-emergent procedures. Under these unprecedented conditions, the decision to defer cases became increasingly difficult as COVID-19 cases skyrocketed. METHODS: Data was collected by self-reporting surveys during two discrete periods: the principal survey accrued responses during 2 weeks at the peak of the global pandemic, and the supplemental survey accrued responses after that to detect changes in opinions and circumstances. Nine hypothetical surgical scenarios were used to query neurosurgeons' opinion on the risk of postponement and the urgency to re-schedule the procedures. An acuity index was generated for each scenario, and this was used to rank the nine cases. RESULTS: There were 494 respondents to the principal survey from 60 countries. 258 (52.5%) reported that all elective cases and clinics have been shut down by their main hospital. A total of 226 respondents (46.1%) reported that their operative volume had dropped more than 50%. For the countries most affected by COVID-19, this proportion was 54.7%. There was a high degree of agreement among our respondents that fast-evolving neuro-oncological cases are non-emergent cases that nonetheless have the highest risk in postponement, and selected vascular cases may have high acuity as well. CONCLUSION: We report on the impact of COVID-19 on neurosurgeons around the world. From their ranking of the nine case scenarios, we deduced a strategic scheme that can serve as a guideline to triage non-emergent neurosurgical procedures during the pandemic. With it, hopefully, neurosurgeons can continue to serve their patients without endangering them either neurologically or risking their exposure to the deadly virus.",0,"The impact of COVID-19 on neurosurgeons and the strategy for triaging non-emergent operations: a global neurosurgery studyOBJECT: The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted all aspects of society globally.

Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory samples by using PCR is the standard laboratory diagnostic tool. Our aim was to perform a limited evaluation of the diagnostic performance and user-friendliness of eleven rapid tests for detection of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Methods All participants were tested with PCR against SARS-CoV-2 at a clinical microbiology laboratory. Comparing with results from PCR tests, we evaluated the rapid tests' performances in three arms; 1) 20 hospitalized patients with PCR-confirmed COVID-19, 2) 23 recovered outpatients with former PCR-confirmed COVID-19, and 3) 49 participants with suspected COVID-19 presenting at a primary care emergency room. Results All eleven tests detected antibodies in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, though with varying sensitivities. In former outpatients recovered from COVID-19, there were differences between tests in the immunoglobulin type G (IgG) sensitivity, with five tests having a sensitivity below 65%. In participants with suspected COVID-19 infection, the rapid tests had very low sensitivities. Most rapid tests were easy to perform and interpret. Conclusions Rapid tests were not suited as stand-alone tests to detect present infection in a Norwegian primary care emergency room population. All the rapid tests were able to detect SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, although sensitivities varied and were generally higher in the study arm of more severely affected participants.

We aimed to assess the safety and immunogenicity of two formulations (frozen and lyophilised) of this vaccine. METHODS: We did two open, non-randomised phase 1/2 studies at two hospitals in Russia. We enrolled healthy adult volunteers (men and women) aged 18-60 years to both studies. In phase 1 of each study, we administered intramuscularly on day 0 either one dose of rAd26-S or one dose of rAd5-S and assessed the safety of the two components for 28 days. In phase 2 of the study, which began no earlier than 5 days after phase 1 vaccination, we administered intramuscularly a prime-boost vaccination, with rAd26-S given on day 0 and rAd5-S on day 21. Primary outcome measures were antigen-specific humoral immunity (SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies measured by ELISA on days 0, 14, 21, 28, and 42) and safety (number of participants with adverse events monitored throughout the study). Secondary outcome measures were antigen-specific cellular immunity (T-cell responses and interferon-gamma concentration) and change in neutralising antibodies (detected with a SARS-CoV-2 neutralisation assay). These trials are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04436471 and NCT04437875. FINDINGS: Between June 18 and Aug 3, 2020, we enrolled 76 participants to the two studies (38 in each study). In each study, nine volunteers received rAd26-S in phase 1, nine received rAd5-S in phase 1, and 20 received rAd26-S and rAd5-S in phase 2. Both vaccine formulations were safe and well tolerated. The most common adverse events were pain at injection site (44 [58%]), hyperthermia (38 [50%]), headache (32 [42%]), asthenia (21 [28%]), and muscle and joint pain (18 [24%]). Most adverse events were mild and no serious adverse events were detected. All participants produced antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 glycoprotein. At day 42, receptor binding domain-specific IgG titres were 14 703 with the frozen formulation and 11 143 with the lyophilised formulation, and neutralising antibodies were 49.25 with the frozen formulation and 45.95 with the lyophilised formulation, with a seroconversion rate of 100%.

67,35513,Changes in risk perception and self-reported protective behaviour during the first week of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States,"Efforts to change behaviour are critical in minimizing the spread of highly transmissible pandemics such as COVID-19. However, it is unclear whether individuals are aware of disease risk and alter their behaviour early in the pandemic. We investigated risk perception and self-reported engagement in protective behaviours in 1591 United States-based individuals cross-sectionally and longitudinally over the first week of the pandemic. Subjects demonstrated growing awareness of risk and reported engaging in protective behaviours with increasing frequency but underestimated their risk of infection relative to the average person in the country. Social distancing and hand washing were most strongly predicted by the perceived probability of personally being infected.

Copyright Â© 2020 The Authors.",0,"Changes in risk perception and self-reported protective behaviour during the first week of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United StatesEfforts to change behaviour are critical in minimizing the spread of highly transmissible pandemics such as COVID-19. However, it is unclear whether individuals are aware of disease risk and alter their behaviour early in the pandemic. We investigated risk perception and self-reported engagement in protective behaviours in 1591 United States-based individuals cross-sectionally and longitudinally over the first week of the pandemic. Subjects demonstrated growing awareness of risk and reported engaging in protective behaviours with increasing frequency but underestimated their risk of infection relative to the average person in the country. Social distancing and hand washing were most strongly predicted by the perceived probability of personally being infected. However, a subgroup of individuals perceived low risk and did not engage in these behaviours.

68,54440,A Double-Edged Sword: Neurologic Complications and Mortality in Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation Therapy for COVID-19-Related Severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome at a Tertiary Care Center,"In this clinical case series, we report our experience to date with neurologic complications of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation therapy for COVID-19 Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome. We have found an unexpectedly increased rate of complications as demonstrated by neuroimaging compared with meta-analysis data in extracorporeal membrane oxygenation therapy for all Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome etiologies over the past few decades and compared with the most recent baseline data describing the incidence of neurologic complication in all patients with COVID-19. For our 12-patient cohort, there was a rate of intracranial hemorrhage of 41.7%. Representative cases and images of devastating intracranial hemorrhage are presented. We hypothesize that the interplay between hematologic changes inherent to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and inflammatory and coagulopathic changes that have begun to be elucidated as part of the COVID-19 disease process are responsible. Continued analysis of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation therapy in this disease paradigm is warranted.

69,28253,Plasma DYRK1A as a novel risk factor for Alzheimer's disease.,To determine whether apparent involvement of DYRK1A in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology makes it a candidate plasma biomarker for diagnosis  we developed a method to quantify plasma DYRK1A by immunoblot in transgenic mouse models having different gene dosages of Dyrk1a  and  consequently  different relative protein expression. Then  we measured plasma DYRK1A levels in 26 patients with biologically confirmed AD and 25 controls (negative amyloid imaging available on 13). DYRK1A was detected in transgenic mouse brain and plasma samples  and relative levels of DYRK1A correlated with the gene copy number. In plasma from AD patients  DYRK1A levels were significantly lower compared with controls (P<0.0001). Results were similar when we compared AD patients with the subgroup of controls confirmed by negative amyloid imaging. In a subgroup of patients with early AD (CDR=0.5)  lower DYRK1A expression was confirmed. In contrast  no difference was found in levels of DYRK1B  the closest relative of DYRK1A  between AD patients and controls. Further  AD patients exhibited a positive correlation between plasma DYRK1A levels and cerebrospinal fluid tau and phosphorylated-tau proteins  but no correlation with amyloid-ﾎｲ42 levels and Pittsburgh compound B cortical binding. DYRK1A levels detected in lymphoblastoid cell lines from AD patients were also lower when compared with cells from age-matched controls. These findings suggest that reduced DYRK1A expression might be a novel plasma risk factor for AD.,0,Plasma DYRK1A as a novel risk factor for Alzheimer's disease.To determine whether apparent involvement of DYRK1A in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology makes it a candidate plasma biomarker for diagnosis  we developed a method to quantify plasma DYRK1A by immunoblot in transgenic mouse models having different gene dosages of Dyrk1a  and  consequently  different relative protein expression.

70,22071,14-3-3 proteins and zeta isoform containing neurofibrillary tangles in patients with Alzheimer's disease.,Immunolocalization of 14-3-3 proteins in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains was investigated using isoform-specific antibodies. Weak granular immunoreactivity of 14-3-3 proteins was found in neuronal cytoplasm in control subjects and AD brains. Both intracellular and extracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs)  as well as neuropil thread-like structures  were immunopositive for 14-3-3 proteins. This was corroborated by triple-fluorolabeling method visualizing paired helical filament (PHF) tau and 14-3-3 epitopes in relation to fibrillary state detected by thiazin red. Pretangle neurons (positive for PHF-tau without fibrillary structure detected by thiazin red) only contained fine granular immunoreactivity (IR) of 14-3-3  which was similarly found in unaffected neurons. Granular cytoplasmic IR of 14-3-3 proteins in pretangle neurons was not colocalized to granular tau-like IR  which suggests that participation of 14-3-3 proteins in NFT formation was restricted to its later stages. Its zeta isoform was most prominent in these NFTs  suggesting that this isoform is a major component involved in the formation of NFTs. In contrast  IR of epsilon isoform was found in the neuropil of the hippocampus and that of sigma isoform was localized to granule cells of the dentate gyrus in AD brains  as seen in the age-matched controls. Expression of 14-3-3 proteins were found to be highly variable and dependent on their isoforms  regions and cell types. Molecular  as well as topographical  dissection of 14-3-3 proteins will provide us with an improved understanding of this molecule in normal and pathological conditions.,0,14-3-3 proteins and zeta isoform containing neurofibrillary tangles in patients with Alzheimer's disease.Immunolocalization of 14-3-3 proteins in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains was investigated using isoform-specific antibodies.

72,33719,Increased intrathecal inflammatory activity in frontotemporal dementia: pathophysiological implications.,OBJECTIVE: Immunological mechanisms may be part of the pathophysiological mechanisms in frontotemporal dementia (FTD)  but hitherto only vague evidence of such mechanisms has been presented. The aim of this study was to compare the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1beta and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha  and the anti-inflammatory cytokine transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta in patients with FTD and normal controls. Furthermore  serum levels of TNF-alpha  TGF-beta  and IL-1beta were measured in FTD patients. METHODS: The CSF levels of IL-1beta  TNFalpha  and TGF-beta were measured using ELISA in 19 patients with FTD and 24 sex and age matched healthy controls. RESULTS: The CSF levels of TNF-alpha (FTD 0.6 pg/mL (median: lower  upper quartile 0.3  0.7); controls: 0.0 pg/mL (0.0  0.0); p = 0.008) and TGF-beta (FTD 266 pg/mL (157  371)  controls: 147 pg/mL (119  156); p = 0.0001) were significantly increased in FTD patients compared with controls. No correlations were found between CSF and serum levels of the cytokines. In the controls  but not in the FTD patients  a positive correlation was found between the CSF levels of TGF-beta and age (r = 0.42  p < 0.05). No correlation was found between any of the cytokines and degree of brain atrophy or white matter changes. No differences between the groups were found for age  gender  or CSF/serum albumin ratio. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest an increased intrathecal production of both pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in FTD. As no correlations were found with the albumin ratio  and no correlations between CSF and serum levels of the cytokines were found  these changes in the CSF cannot be explained by a systemic overproduction of cytokines.,0,Increased intrathecal inflammatory activity in frontotemporal dementia: pathophysiological implications.OBJECTIVE: Immunological mechanisms may be part of the pathophysiological mechanisms in frontotemporal dementia (FTD)  but hitherto only vague evidence of such mechanisms has been presented.

73,21232,Beta-amyloid deposition in brain is enhanced in mouse models of arterial hypertension.,There are conflicting evidence regarding the association of hypertension with Alzheimer's disease (AD)  and so far it is still unexplored whether increased blood pressure levels can be mechanistically related to the pathophysiology of AD. Since the deposition of beta-amyloid (A beta) in brain represents the first pathogenetic event in the onset of AD  in this study we investigated the role of hypertension in the brain deposition of A beta. We analyzed two independent mouse models of hypertension. In both models we observed an increased permeability of blood-brain barrier in cortex and hippocampus. More interestingly  in the same areas hypertensive mice showed a marked positivity to anti-A beta antibodies and the presence of A beta-like fragments. Finally  we analyzed mice after passive immunotherapy with anti-A beta IgG. We observed that this latter approach determined a markedly reduced A beta immunopositivity in both cortex and hippocampus. Our study demonstrates that chronic hypertension determines an impairment of the blood-brain barrier permeability with deposition of A beta in brain tissue and that passive immunotherapy prevents this latter phenomenon.,0,Beta-amyloid deposition in brain is enhanced in mouse models of arterial hypertension.There are conflicting evidence regarding the association of hypertension with Alzheimer's disease (AD)  and so far it is still unexplored whether increased blood pressure levels can be mechanistically related to the pathophysiology of AD.

75,63409,Neutrophil to Lymphocyte Ratio as Prognostic and Predictive Factor in Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019: A Retrospective Cross-sectional Study,"OBJECTIVE: This retrospective study was designed to explore whether neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is a prognostic factor in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19). METHODS: A cohort of patients with covid-19 admitted to the Tongren Hospital of Wuhan University from January 11, 2020 to March 3, 2020 was retrospectively analyzed. Patients with hematologic malignancy were excluded. The NLR was calculated by dividing the neutrophil count by the lymphocyte count. NLR values were measured at the time of admission. The primary outcome was all-cause in-hospital mortality. A multivariate logistic analysis was performed. RESULTS: 1004 patients with covid-19 were included in this study. The mortality rate was 4.0% (40 cases). The median age of nonsurvivors (68 years) was significantly older than survivors (62 years). Male sex was more predominant in nonsurvival group (27; 67.5%) than in the survival group (466; 48.3%). NLR value of nonsurvival group (median 49.06, IQR 25.71-69.70) was higher than that of survival group (median 4.11, IQR 2.44-8.12, P < 0.001). In multivariate logistic regression analysis, after adjusting for confounding factors, NLR > 11.75 was significantly correlated with all-cause in-hospital mortality (OR = 44.351, 95% CI = 4.627-425.088). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the NLR at hospital admission is associated in-hospital mortality among patients with covid-19. Therefore, the NLR appears to be a significant prognostic biomarker of outcomes in critically ill patients with covid-19. However, further investigation is needed to validate this relationship with data collected prospectively. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

76,21278,Characteristics of children and young adults with Marfan syndrome and aortic root dilation in a randomized trial comparing atenolol and losartan therapy,Background The Pediatric Heart Network designed a clinical trial to compare aortic root growth and other short-term cardiovascular outcomes in children and young adults with Marfan syndrome randomized to receive atenolol or losartan. We report here the characteristics of the screened population and enrolled subjects. Methods and results Between 2007 and 2011  21 clinical sites randomized 608 subjects  aged 6 months to 25 years who met the original Ghent criteria and had a body surface area-adjusted aortic root diameter z-score >3.0. The mean age at study entry was 11.2 years  60% were male  and 25% were older teenagers and young adults. The median aortic root diameter z-score was 4.0. Aortic root diameter z-score did not vary with age. Mitral valve prolapse and mitral regurgitation were more common in females. Among those with a positive family history  56% had a family member with aortic surgery  and 32% had a family member with a history of aortic dissection. Conclusions Baseline demographic  clinical  and anthropometric characteristics of the randomized cohort are representative of patients in this population with moderate to severe aortic root dilation. The high percentage of young subjects with relatives who have had aortic dissection or surgery illustrates the need for more definitive therapy; we expect that the results of the study and the wealth of systematic data collected will make an important contribution to the management of individuals with Marfan syndrome. © 2013  Mosby  Inc.

METHODS: The rat model of Alzheimer's disease (AD) was established using D-galactose to cause subacute aging combined with Meynert nucleus damage. Rat behavior was monitored using the Morris water maze  and the expression of beta-APP in rat brain tissue was detected via immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: CDST significantly improved spatial cognition and decreased beta-APP expression in the cortex and hippocampus (P < 0.05  P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: CDST can significantly improve spatial cognition in a rat model of AD.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis of outcome  complications  and their underlying causes was carried out in 391 patients who had percutaneous gastrostomies performed in two different university medical centers from January 2005 to April 2010 by interventional radiology. Forty-three were performed under general anesthesia and 348 were under local anesthesia and conscious sedation; in 349  fluoroscopic guidance was used  in 17 ultrasound  and in 22 CT. RESULTS: Three hundred and seventy-six procedures were technically successful (96%). The procedure-related mortality was 2.5%. Fifty-seven gastrostomies were removed after clinical condition of the patients had improved. Only 36 gastrostomies remained functional for a year or longer. Major complications attributable to PRGs occurred in 6.1% (24 of 391) of our patients. On retrospective analysis  faulty technique may have been a major factor in many of these 24 patients. Injuries of abdominal organs and misplaced gastrostomies occasioned by improper localization of T fasteners were the major culprits. Minor complications occurred in 17.6% of patients. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Meticulous pre-procedural assessment of the topographic anatomy  preferably by CT  is mandatory to avoid or minimize by injury of colon  spleen  liver etc. Precise placement of T fasteners and confirmation of gastric access under cross-table lateral fluoroscopy is necessary for proper placement of the gastrostomy tube.

79,38447,Brain glucose metabolism in vascular white matter disease with dementia: differentiation from Alzheimer disease.,BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The boundary between vascular dementia and Alzheimer disease (AD) continues to be unclear. Some posit that gradually progressive vascular dementia  as with small vessel disease  is simply vascular disease plus AD. Because AD presents a characteristic pattern on fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography  we sought to determine whether the fluorodeoxyglucose pattern of vascular dementia resembled more AD or the pattern in nondemented patients with severe microvascular brain disease. METHODS: Vascular disease patients were selected on the basis of confluent white matter lesions on both hemispheres. Among them  with a similar degree of vascular disease on MRI  neuropsychological testing separated groups with dementia and without dementia. Patients with AD and healthy controls were also studied. The 4 groups  with 12 subjects each  were matched by age  gender  and educational level. Fluorodeoxyglucose distribution was analyzed using both voxel-based and volume of interest methods. RESULTS: The AD group had the characteristic pattern of bilaterally decreased metabolism in parieto-temporal association cortex and precuneus. By contrast  patients with vascular disease and dementia had a similar anatomic pattern to that of the vascular patients without dementia  but with greater metabolic abnormalities  particularly in the frontal lobes and deep nuclei. CONCLUSIONS: The anatomy of metabolic abnormalities in vascular disease with dementia suggests that  at least in some cases  dementia with vascular disease may be independent of AD. The metabolic abnormality involves the thalamus  caudate  and frontal lobe  a pattern concordant with the neuropsychological findings of impaired executive function characteristic of vascular dementia.,0,Brain glucose metabolism in vascular white matter disease with dementia: differentiation from Alzheimer disease.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The boundary between vascular dementia and Alzheimer disease (AD) continues to be unclear.

By contrast  patients with vascular disease and dementia had a similar anatomic pattern to that of the vascular patients without dementia  but with greater metabolic abnormalities  particularly in the frontal lobes and deep nuclei. CONCLUSIONS: The anatomy of metabolic abnormalities in vascular disease with dementia suggests that  at least in some cases  dementia with vascular disease may be independent of AD. The metabolic abnormality involves the thalamus  caudate  and frontal lobe  a pattern concordant with the neuropsychological findings of impaired executive function characteristic of vascular dementia.,"{'judgement': 'False', 'index': 79}",0,"{'judgement': 'False', 'index': 79}",0,"{'judgement': 'False', 'index': 79}",0

81,67,Neurological manifestations of coronavirus infections - a systematic review,"To optimize diagnostic workup of the current severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, we systematically reviewed neurological and neuroradiological manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 and all other known human coronavirus species (HCoV). Which lessons can we learn? We identified relevant publications (until 26 July 2020) using systematic searches in PubMed, Web of Science, and Ovid EMBASE with predefined search strings. A total of 4571 unique publications were retrieved, out of which 378 publications were selected for in-depth analysis by two raters, including a total of 17549 (out of which were 14418 SARS-CoV-2) patients. Neurological complications and associated neuroradiological manifestations are prevalent for all HCoVs (HCoV-229E, HKU1, NL63, OC43, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV, SARS-CoV-1, and SARS-CoV-2). Moreover there are similarities in symptomatology across different HCoVs, particularly between SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2. Common neurological manifestations include fatigue, headache, and smell/taste disorders. Additionally, clinicians need to be attentive for at least five classes of neurological complications: (1) Cerebrovascular disorders including ischemic stroke and macro/micro-hemorrhages, (2) encephalopathies, (3) para-/postinfectious immune-mediated complications such as Guillain-Barre syndrome and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, (4) (meningo-)encephalitis, potentially with concomitant seizures, and (5) neuropsychiatric complications such as psychosis and mood disorders. Our systematic review highlights the need for vigilance regarding neurological complications in patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 and other HCoVs, especially since some complications may result in chronic disability. Neuroimaging protocols should be designed to specifically screen for these complications.

83,47128,Excess mortality in England and Wales during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic,"BACKGROUND: Deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic result directly from infection and exacerbation of other diseases and indirectly from deferment of care for other conditions, and are socially and geographically patterned. We quantified excess mortality in regions of England and Wales during the pandemic, for all causes and for non-COVID-19-associated deaths. METHODS: Weekly mortality data for 1 January 2010 to 1 May 2020 for England and Wales were obtained from the Office of National Statistics. Mean-dispersion negative binomial regressions were used to model death counts based on pre-pandemic trends and exponentiated linear predictions were subtracted from: (i) all-cause deaths and (ii) all-cause deaths minus COVID-19 related deaths for the pandemic period (week starting 7 March, to week ending 8 May). FINDINGS: Between 7 March and 8 May 2020, there were 47 243 (95% CI: 46 671 to 47 815) excess deaths in England and Wales, of which 9948 (95% CI: 9376 to 10 520) were not associated with COVID-19. Overall excess mortality rates varied from 49 per 100 000 (95% CI: 49 to 50) in the South West to 102 per 100 000 (95% CI: 102 to 103) in London.

The recommendations advised against initiation of new fertility treatment cycles outside of emergent fertility preservation. Our objective was to evaluate what SART-member fertility clinics communicated to the public and their patients via clinic websites during this time period. Design(s): Cross-sectional study. Material(s) and Method(s): Between 4/20/20 and 4/24/20, SART-member fertility clinic websites were reviewed for REI-specific COVID-19 messages (REI-CM). The REI-CM was evaluated for: type of treatment offered, and to whom; adherence to updated ASRM guidance; and citation of ASRM (or other) guidance. Each website was evaluated by two reviewers and arbitrated by a third in the case of discrepancies. Practice size, type, and location were abstracted from SART. Clinics were classified by whether they were under a shelter in place (SIP) order and the duration of that order. Chi squared analyses were performed to determine associations between clinic demographics and patterns in messaging. Result(s): 381 SART-member clinics maintained active websites. Of those, 249 (65.3%) had REI-CM. The presence of REI-CM was more common in private than academic practices (73% vs 38%, p<0.001) and with increasing practice volume: 38% of clinics with <200 annual cycles vs 91% of clinics with >1000 cycles (p<0.001). There was a trend toward increased REI-CM use in states with a SIP order for >=30 days (70% of 212, p=0.064). ASRM guidance was cited in 61% (n=152) of REI-CM; however, only 33% (n=82) outlined treatment practices that reflected ASRM guidance published at the time of the data extraction. Adherence to ASRM guidelines was more common in academic than private practices (54% vs 31%, p=0.02) but was not correlated with size of practice or geographic region. Conversely, 18% (n=44) of practices announced treating patients on a ""case-by-case basis"" with definitions ranging from specific (""women with AMH <0.7"") to vague (""as determined by our providers alongside our patients""). Additionally, 9% of REI-CM (n=23) announced continued treatment regardless of a patient's clinical urgency. This messaging was more common in groups doing >1000 cycles a year (18%, p=0.009), with a trend toward practices in the northeast (16%, p=0.113) and in states with SIP orders lasting <30 days (14%, p=0.09). Clinics treating all-comers were less likely to cite ASRM than other clinics (41% vs 62%, p=0.045). However, 75% (n=14) cited COVID-19 guidance from WHO, CDC and state and local governments. Conclusion(s): While public messaging may not reflect the actual practices of a clinic, this study reveals heterogeneity in how clinics incorporated ASRM recommendations and responded to the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The aim of this study was to assess the role of tocilizumab in reducing the risk of invasive mechanical ventilation and death in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia who received standard of care treatment. Method(s): This retrospective, observational cohort study included adults (>=18 years) with severe COVID-19 pneumonia who were admitted to tertiary care centres in Bologna and Reggio Emilia, Italy, between Feb 21 and March 24, 2020, and a tertiary care centre in Modena, Italy, between Feb 21 and April 30, 2020. All patients were treated with the standard of care (ie, supplemental oxygen, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, antiretrovirals, and low molecular weight heparin), and a non-randomly selected subset of patients also received tocilizumab. Tocilizumab was given either intravenously at 8 mg/kg bodyweight (up to a maximum of 800 mg) in two infusions, 12 h apart, or subcutaneously at 162 mg administered in two simultaneous doses, one in each thigh (ie, 324 mg in total), when the intravenous formulation was unavailable. The primary endpoint was a composite of invasive mechanical ventilation or death. Treatment groups were compared using Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regression analysis after adjusting for sex, age, recruiting centre, duration of symptoms, and baseline Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score. Finding(s): Of 1351 patients admitted, 544 (40%) had severe COVID-19 pneumonia and were included in the study. 57 (16%) of 365 patients in the standard care group needed mechanical ventilation, compared with 33 (18%) of 179 patients treated with tocilizumab (p=0.41; 16 [18%] of 88 patients treated intravenously and 17 [19%] of 91 patients treated subcutaneously). 73 (20%) patients in the standard care group died, compared with 13 (7%; p<0.0001) patients treated with tocilizumab (six [7%] treated intravenously and seven [8%] treated subcutaneously). After adjustment for sex, age, recruiting centre, duration of symptoms, and SOFA score, tocilizumab treatment was associated with a reduced risk of invasive mechanical ventilation or death (adjusted hazard ratio 0.61, 95% CI 0.40-0.92; p=0.020). 24 (13%) of 179 patients treated with tocilizumab were diagnosed with new infections, versus 14 (4%) of 365 patients treated with standard of care alone (p<0.0001).

Finding(s): Of 1351 patients admitted, 544 (40%) had severe COVID-19 pneumonia and were included in the study. 57 (16%) of 365 patients in the standard care group needed mechanical ventilation, compared with 33 (18%) of 179 patients treated with tocilizumab (p=0.41; 16 [18%] of 88 patients treated intravenously and 17 [19%] of 91 patients treated subcutaneously). 73 (20%) patients in the standard care group died, compared with 13 (7%; p<0.0001) patients treated with tocilizumab (six [7%] treated intravenously and seven [8%] treated subcutaneously). After adjustment for sex, age, recruiting centre, duration of symptoms, and SOFA score, tocilizumab treatment was associated with a reduced risk of invasive mechanical ventilation or death (adjusted hazard ratio 0.61, 95% CI 0.40-0.92; p=0.020). 24 (13%) of 179 patients treated with tocilizumab were diagnosed with new infections, versus 14 (4%) of 365 patients treated with standard of care alone (p<0.0001). Interpretation(s): Treatment with tocilizumab, whether administered intravenously or subcutaneously, might reduce the risk of invasive mechanical ventilation or death in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia.

It is now evident that the world needs a speedy and quicker solution to contain and tackle the further spread of COVID-19 across the world with the aid of non-clinical approaches such as data mining approaches, augmented intelligence and other artificial intelligence techniques so as to mitigate the huge burden on the healthcare system while providing the best possible means for patients' diagnosis and prognosis of the 2019-nCoV pandemic effectively. In this study, data mining models were developed for the prediction of COVID-19 infected patients' recovery using epidemiological dataset of COVID-19 patients of South Korea. The decision tree, support vector machine, naive Bayes, logistic regression, random forest, and K-nearest neighbor algorithms were applied directly on the dataset using python programming language to develop the models. The model predicted a minimum and maximum number of days for COVID-19 patients to recover from the virus, the age group of patients who are of high risk not to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, those who are likely to recover and those who might be likely to recover quickly from COVID-19 pandemic. The results of the present study have shown that the model developed with decision tree data mining algorithm is more efficient to predict the possibility of recovery of the infected patients from COVID-19 pandemic with the overall accuracy of 99.85% which stands to be the best model developed among the models developed with other algorithms including support vector machine, naive Bayes, logistic regression, random forest, and K-nearest neighbor.

METHODS: A neuropsychological examination and a quantitative EEG study were done in 20 patients with Alzheimer's dementia before initiating treatment with rivastigmine. After one week of treatment a second EEG examination was done. Therapeutic efficacy was determined six months after treatment initiation. Treatment response was defined as improvement in short term memory after six months of rivastigmine treatment. RESULTS: For the group of patients as a whole  there was a significant improvement in short term memory and orientation during rivastigmine treatment. The mini-mental state score improved from 20.2 to 21.7 (NS). In the EEG  theta power decreased significantly after one week of treatment. Treatment responders had a greater decrease in theta power after one week of treatment and a better short term memory at baseline than non-responders. Decrease in theta power during rivastigmine treatment and baseline short term memory were good predictors of treatment response.

96,64046,Volumetric MRI predicts rate of cognitive decline related to AD and cerebrovascular disease.,OBJECTIVE: To examine volumetric MRI correlates of longitudinal cognitive decline in normal aging  AD  and subcortical cerebrovascular brain injury (SCVBI). BACKGROUND: Previous cross-sectional studies examining the relationship between cognitive impairment and dementia have shown that hippocampal and cortical gray matter atrophy are the most important predictors of cognitive impairment  even in cases with SCVBI. The authors hypothesized that hippocampal and cortical gray matter volume also would best predict rate of cognitive decline in cases with and without SCVBI. METHODS: Subjects were recruited for a multicenter study of contributions to dementia of AD and SCVBI. The sample (n = 120) included cognitively normal  cognitively impaired  and demented cases with and without lacunes identified by MRI. Cases with cortical strokes were excluded. Average length of follow-up was 3.0 years. Measures of hippocampal volume  volume of cortical gray matter  presence of subcortical lacunes  and volume of white matter hyperintensity were derived from MRI. Random effects modeling of longitudinal data was used to assess effects of baseline MRI variables on longitudinal change in a measure of global cognitive ability. RESULTS: Cortical gray matter atrophy predicted cognitive decline regardless of whether lacunes were present. Hippocampal atrophy predicted decline only in those without lacunes. Neither lacunes nor white matter hyperintensity independently predicted decline. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that cortical atrophy is an index of disease severity in both AD and subcortical cerebrovascular brain injury and consequently predicts faster progression. Hippocampal volume may index disease severity and predict progression in AD. The absence of this effect in cases with lacunes suggests that this group is etiologically heterogeneous and is not composed simply of cases of AD with incidental stroke.,0,Volumetric MRI predicts rate of cognitive decline related to AD and cerebrovascular disease.OBJECTIVE: To examine volumetric MRI correlates of longitudinal cognitive decline in normal aging  AD  and subcortical cerebrovascular brain injury (SCVBI).

The role of Wireless Capsule Endoscopy (WCE) in patients (pts.) with clinically suspected CD remains to be established. Aim. To assess, in a prospective longitudinal study, the diagnostic role of WCE in pts. with symptoms highly compatible with small bowel CD, not confirmed by conventional techniques. Methods. From Sept. 2005 to Oct. 2008, all consecutive pts. with clinically suspected CD and not conclusive findings at ileocolonoscopy (IC), Small Bowel Follow Through (SBFT) and Small Bowel Contrast Ultrasonography (SICUS) were enrolled. Signs and/or symptoms compatible with CD included at least one the followings: chronic diarrhoea and/or abdominal pain, weight loss, fever, abdominal mass, iron-deficient anaemia (IDA), perianal disease. SICUS findings compatible with CD included bowel wall thickness >3 mm, abscesses, fistulae, bowel dilation (>25 mm). At WCE findings compatible with CD included: >3 aphtoid ulcers, deep ulcers, strictures. Results. Conventional techniques did not lead to a conclusive diagnosis in 41 pts. with clinically suspected CD (25 F, median age 31 yrs, range 17-64), including chronic diarrhoea in 32 (78%) and/ or abdominal pain in 30 (73%), weight loss in 10 (24%), fever in 7 (17%), IDA in 7 (17%) and/or perianal disease in 3 (7%) pts.

All these 41 pts. were studied by both WCE and IC (ileum visualized in 36; 88%), while 38/41 (93%) were also studied by SICUS and 34/41 (83%) by SBFT. Findings compatible but not diagnostic for CD were detected by IC in 12/36 (33%) pts. (including aphtoid ulcers in 10/12; deep ulcers in 2/12), by SICUS in 13/38 (34%) and by SBFT in 9/34 (26%) pts.

Among these 18 pts., WCE findings compatible with CD were observed in 10/41 (24%) pts. The median follow up after WCE was 10 mths (range 1-38). Among the 10 pts. showing lesions at WCE, 4 were treated with budesonide (9 mg/day) and 6 mesalazine (2.4 gr/day), followed by remission (CDAI< 150). WCE impact was observed in 1 pt. with an ulcerated small bowel stenosis, requiring surgical removal, leading to an histological diagnosis of CD. Conclusions. The use of WCE in pts. with symptoms highly compatible with CD, not confirmed by conventional techniques, may detect lesions compatible with CD in almost one third of pts.

Among these 18 pts., WCE findings compatible with CD were observed in 10/41 (24%) pts. The median follow up after WCE was 10 mths (range 1-38). Among the 10 pts. showing lesions at WCE, 4 were treated with budesonide (9 mg/day) and 6 mesalazine (2.4 gr/day), followed by remission (CDAI< 150). WCE impact was observed in 1 pt. with an ulcerated small bowel stenosis, requiring surgical removal, leading to an histological diagnosis of CD. Conclusions. The use of WCE in pts. with symptoms highly compatible with CD, not confirmed by conventional techniques, may detect lesions compatible with CD in almost one third of pts. Unexpected WCE impact may be related to a previously unknown stenosis, leading to diagnostic surgery.","{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 98}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 98}",1,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 98}",1

The present studies have characterized the in vitro properties of a radiolabeled small molecule gamma-secretase inhibitor  [3H]compound D (Yan et al.  2004  J.

[3H]Compound D was shown to bind with nanomolar affinity (Kd = 0.32-1.5 nM) to a single population of saturable sites in rat  rhesus and human brain cortex homogenates  the density of binding sites ranging from 4 to 7 nM across the species. Competition studies with a structurally diverse group of gamma-secretase inhibitors with a wide range of binding affinities showed that the binding affinities of these compounds correlated well with their ability to inhibit gamma-secretase in vitro. Autoradiographic studies showed that the specific binding of [3H]compound D was widely distributed throughout adult rat  rhesus and normal human brain. There did not appear to be any difference in distribution of [3H]compound D specific binding sites in AD cortex compared with control human cortex as measured using tissue section autoradiography  nor any correlation between gamma-secretase binding and plaque burden as measured immunohistochemically.

100,37931,Temporally distinct phosphorylations differentiate Tau-dependent learning deficits and premature mortality in Drosophila.,Abnormally phosphorylated Tau protein  the major component of neurofibrillary tangles  is critical in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease and related Tauopathies. We used Drosophila to examine the role of key disease-associated phosphorylation sites on Tau-mediated neurotoxicity. We present evidence that the late-appearing phosphorylation on Ser(238) rather than hyperphosphorylation per se is essential for Tau toxicity underlying premature mortality in adult flies. This site is also occupied at the time of neurodegeneration onset in a mouse Tauopathy model and in damaged brain areas of confirmed Tauopathy patients  suggesting a similar critical role on Tau toxicity in humans. In contrast  occupation of Ser(262) is necessary for Tau-dependent learning deficits in adult Drosophila. Significantly  occupation of Ser(262) precedes and is required for Ser(238) phosphorylation  and these temporally distinct phosphorylations likely reflect conformational changes. Because sequential occupation of Ser(262) and Ser(238) is required for the progression from Tau-mediated learning deficits to premature mortality in Drosophila  they may also play similar roles in the escalating symptom severity in Tauopathy patients  congruent with their presence in damaged regions of their brains.,0,Temporally distinct phosphorylations differentiate Tau-dependent learning deficits and premature mortality in Drosophila.Abnormally phosphorylated Tau protein  the major component of neurofibrillary tangles  is critical in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease and related Tauopathies.

Methods: Single-centre cohort performed from 3 March 2020 to 14 April 2020 in four intensive care units in Bordeaux University Hospital, France. All patients with COVID-19 and pulmonary severity criteria were included. AKI was defined using Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria. A systematic urinary analysis was performed. The incidence, severity, clinical presentation, biological characterization (transient versus persistent AKI; proteinuria, haematuria and glycosuria) and short-term outcomes were evaluated. Results: Seventy-one patients were included, with basal serum creatinine (SCr) of 69 +/- 21 micro mol/L. At admission, AKI was present in 8/71 (11%) patients. Median [interquartile range (IQR)] follow-up was 17 (12-23) days. AKI developed in a total of 57/71 (80%) patients, with 35% Stage 1, 35% Stage 2 and 30% Stage 3 AKI; 10/57 (18%) required renal replacement therapy (RRT). Transient AKI was present in only 4/55 (7%) patients and persistent AKI was observed in 51/55 (93%). Patients with persistent AKI developed a median (IQR) urine protein/creatinine of 82 (54-140) (mg/mmol) with an albuminuria/proteinuria ratio of 0.23 +/- 20, indicating predominant tubulointerstitial injury. Only two (4%) patients had glycosuria. At Day 7 after onset of AKI, six (11%) patients remained dependent on RRT, nine (16%) had SCr >200 micro mol/L and four (7%) had died.

In some patients the infection results in moderate to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), requiring invasive mechanical ventilation.

Despite the large numbers of COVID-19 cases and deaths, information on the phenotype and kinetics of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells is limited. Here, we studied 10 COVID-19 patients who required admission to an intensive care unit and detected SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in 10 out of 10 and 8 out of 10 patients, respectively. We also detected low levels of SARS-CoV-2-reactive T cells in 2 out of 10 healthy controls not previously exposed to SARS-CoV-2, which is indicative of cross-reactivity due to past infection with 'common cold' coronaviruses. The strongest T-cell responses were directed to the spike (S) surface glycoprotein, and SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells predominantly produced effector and Th1 cytokines, although Th2 and Th17 cytokines were also detected. Furthermore, we studied T-cell kinetics and showed that SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells are present relatively early and increase over time. Collectively, these data shed light on the potential variations in T-cell responses as a function of disease severity, an issue that is key to understanding the potential role of immunopathology in the disease, and also inform vaccine design and evaluation.

An inescapable paradox when our work consists precisely in de-confining, connecting, being in contact with each other.

These modifications of the psychotherapeutic setting will be described in terms of constructing a virtual mental institution, based on a setting twisted by the distance but not abolished, telephone consultations opening up to a speculative but not disembodied psychopathological imaginary, and finally a blog as a quasi-materialization of a virtual space.

OBJECTIVES: To compare brain Aﾎｲ and NFT load and glucose metabolism in advanced elderly (70 years and older) patients with AD and healthy controls (HCs) by PET with [18F]FDDNP and [18F]FDG. METHODS: Seven AD patients (mean ﾂｱ SD age 79.3 ﾂｱ 3.6 y  Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score 22.1 ﾂｱ 2.5) and eight HCs (mean age ﾂｱ SD  75.7 ﾂｱ 3.9 y; MMSE score 29.0 ﾂｱ 1.2) underwent PET with [18F]FDDNP and [18F]FDG. RESULTS: Global [18F]FDDNP uptake was significantly higher (p < 0.05) in AD patients (1.15 ﾂｱ 0.04) than in HCs (1.10 ﾂｱ 0.06)  while global brain metabolism was lower in AD patients than in HCs (AD patients 0.96 ﾂｱ 0.09; HCs 1.13 ﾂｱ 0.11; p < 0.05). In HCs  brain glucose metabolism was correlated with age for both the global [18F]FDG SUVr and in the parietal and posterior cingulate regions  while no correlation was found between age and [18F]FDDNP uptake. In AD patients  global [18F]FDDNP uptake and uptake in the frontal and anterior cingulate regions of interest were correlated with MMSE score  while no correlation was observed with brain glucose metabolism. CONCLUSION: Imaging Aﾎｲ load and NFT with [18F]FDDNP can distinguish AD patients from HCs in an advanced elderly population. It seems to be less sensitive than [18F]FDG to the brain changes observed with normal aging  but more sensitive to cognitive decline in advanced elderly AD patients.,0,Brain [18F]FDDNP binding and glucose metabolism in advanced elderly healthy subjects and Alzheimer's disease patients.BACKGROUND: Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of brain amyloid (Aﾎｲ) and neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) load is a candidate biomarker of Alzheimer's disease (AD).

Here  we report the importance of a nine-residue peptide motif  (66)VGGAVVTGV(74)  in the fibrillization and cytotoxicity of human alpha-Syn. Mutagenesis combined with thioflavin T fluorescence detection  atomic force microscopic imaging  and cytotoxicity assays reveal that deletion of this sequence completely eliminates alpha-Syn fibrillization and cell toxicity. However  deletion of the (71)VTGV(74) sequence decreases the fibrillization rate while the cytotoxicity remains unchanged. Incorporation of charged residues within this region slows aggregation and even impedes filament formation. In addition  substitution of Gly68 with Ala or C-terminal truncations of alpha-Syn accelerate the fibrillization processes. Circular dichroism studies suggest that beta-sheet formation is often concomitant with filament formation. Thus  this segment  namely  the GAV motif  is responsible for aggregation or fibrillization of alpha-Syn and perhaps other amyloidogenic proteins. The oligomers formed during fibrillogenesis might be associated with the cytotoxicities of various alpha-Syn species.

This study applies the criteria in a memory clinic population  using clinical criteria as the reference criterion. METHODS: 138 AD patients  145 nondemented subjects  78 patients with other dementias and 91 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) were included. Dichotomized medial temporal lobe atrophy (MTA) score on MRI and dichotomized CSF profiles (based on beta-amyloid1-42  tau and phosphorylated tau at threonine 181 levels) were used in combination with an episodic memory test to assess sensitivity  specificity and likelihood ratios (LR) of the newly proposed criteria and their components separately. RESULTS: We found specificities of 95 and 49% for comparison with nondemented subjects and other demented patients  respectively  with a sensitivity of 86% for AD. Specificity was highest (100 and 77%  respectively  LR+ = 48) when both MTA score and CSF profile were abnormal in addition to the episodic memory test  at the cost of a low sensitivity (48%). CONCLUSION: The newly proposed research criteria for AD yield a good specificity for comparison with nondemented subjects.

117,48131,Neuroprotective mechanisms of lithium in murine human immunodeficiency virus-1 encephalitis.,Lithium (Li) has garnered considerable interest as a neuroprotective drug for a broad range of nervous system disorders. Its neuroprotective activities occur as a consequence of glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta) inhibition leading to downstream blockade of beta-catenin and Tau phosphorylation. In the present study  we investigated Li-mediated neuroprotective mechanisms in laboratory and murine human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) encephalitis (HIVE) models. In laboratory tests  Li protected neurons from neurotoxic secretions of HIV-1-infected monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs). This neuroprotection was mediated  in part  through the phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase/Akt and GSK-3beta pathways. To examine the effects of Li treatment in vivo  MDMs were injected into the basal ganglia of severe combined immunodeficient mice and then Li was administered (60 mg/kg/d). Seven days after MDM injection  mice were killed and CNS tissue was collected and subjected to immunocytochemical and Western blot assays for leukocyte and neural antigens  GSK-3beta  and key kinase substrates such as beta-catenin and Tau. Numbers of HIV-1 p24 antigen-positive MDMs were unaltered by Li treatment of HIVE mice. Similarly  the greatly increased extent of astrocyte and microglia activation in HIVE mice (10-fold and 16-fold  respectively  compared with unmanipulated controls) was also unaltered by Li. In contrast  Li restored HIVE-associated loss of microtubule-associated protein-2-positive neurites and synaptic density while reducing levels or activity of phospho-Tau Ser202  phospho-beta-catenin  and GSK-3beta. Electrophysiological recordings showed diminished long-term potentiation in hippocampal slices of HIVE mice that were restored by Li.

While p53 accumulates in cells of AD brain  it is not known if p53 plays an active role in Abeta-induced apoptosis.

We show here that inactivation of p53 in two experimental cell lines  either by expression of the papillomavirus E6 protein or by a shift to restrictive temperature  does not affect apoptosis induction by Abeta (25-35)  indicating that Abeta induces apoptosis in a p53-independent manner.,"{'judgement': 'False', 'index': 121}",0,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 121}",1,"{'judgement': 'False', 'index': 121}",0

123,43927,Functional network connectivity in the behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia.,INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to investigate  using resting state (RS) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)  the functional connectivity within and among brain networks in patients with the behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD)  compared with healthy controls and patients with probable Alzheimer's disease (pAD). METHODS: Twelve bvFTD patients were compared with 30 controls and 18 pAD patients. Functional connectivity within the salience  default mode (DMN)  executive (EXN)  attention/working memory (ATT/WM)  and dorsal attentional networks was assessed using independent component analysis. The temporal associations among RS networks (RSNs) were explored using the functional network connectivity toolbox. RESULTS: A decreased dorsal salience network (DSN) connectivity  mainly involving the anterior cingulum  was observed in bvFTD versus controls and pAD. BvFTD was also characterized by a decreased ventral salience network connectivity in the basal ganglia  and divergent connectivity effects versus controls in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (decreased) and precuneus (enhanced) within the right ATT/WM network. The dorsal attentional network had a decreased connectivity with the DMN and EXN in bvFTD versus controls  and a decreased connectivity with the DSN versus pAD. CONCLUSIONS: RSN functional abnormalities occur in bvFTD  involving not only the salience network  but also the DMN and fronto-parietal network associated with ATT and WM modulation. The pattern of functional changes differs from that seen in pAD. The altered interactions among RSN observed in bvFTD and pAD may provide a new venue to explore the functional correlates of cognitive abnormalities in neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders.,0,Functional network connectivity in the behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia.INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to investigate  using resting state (RS) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)  the functional connectivity within and among brain networks in patients with the behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD)  compared with healthy controls and patients with probable Alzheimer's disease (pAD).

We report the design and chemical synthesis of a derivative of human amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide that is capable of selectively targeting individual amyloid plaques in the brain of Alzheimer's disease transgenic mice after being intravenously injected. This derivative is based on the sequence of the first 30 amino acid residues of Abeta with asparagyl/glutamyl-4-aminobutane residues (N-4ab/Q-4ab) substituted at unique Asp and Glu positions and with Gd-DTPA-aminohexanoic acid covalently attached at the N-terminal Asp. The Gd[N-4ab/Q-4ab]Abeta30 peptide was homogeneous as shown by high-resolution analytical techniques with a mass of +/-4385 Da determined by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. This diamine- and gadolinium-substituted derivative of Abeta is shown to have enhanced in vitro binding to Alzheimer's disease (AD) amyloid plaques and increased in vivo permeability at the blood-brain barrier because of the unique Asp/Glu substitutions. In addition  specific in vivo targeting to AD amyloid plaques is demonstrated throughout the brain of an APP  PS1 transgenic mouse after intravenous injection. Because of the magnetic resonance (MR) imaging contrast enhancement provided by gadolinium  this derivative should enable the in vivo MR imaging of individual amyloid plaques in the brains of AD animals or patients to allow for early diagnosis and also provide a direct measure of the efficacy of anti-amyloid therapies currently being developed.,0,"Design and chemical synthesis of a magnetic resonance contrast agent with enhanced in vitro binding, high blood-brain barrier permeability, and in vivo targeting to Alzheimer's disease amyloid plaques.Molecular imaging is an important new direction in medical diagnosis; however  its success is dependent upon molecular probes that demonstrate selective tissue targeting.

125,36988,Frontal lobe hypoperfusion and depressive symptoms in Alzheimer disease.,BACKGROUND: Depressive symptoms of varying severity are prevalent in up to 63% of Alzheimer disease (AD) patients and often result in greater cognitive decline and increased caregiver burden. The current study aimed to determine the neural correlates of depressive symptoms in a sample of AD patients. METHODS: Using the Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia  we assessed 56 patients who met criteria for probable AD. Data obtained from Technetium-99m ethyl cysteinate dimer single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) were analyzed with the use of a magnetic resonance imaging-derived region of interest (ROI) anatomic template before and after atrophy correction and statistical parametric mapping (SPM). The following 4 frontal ROIs were investigated bilaterally: middle frontal gyrus (Brodmann's area [BA] 46)  orbitofrontal cortex (BA 11)  superior prefrontal (BA 8/9) and anterior cingulate (BA 24/25/32/33). RESULTS: Depressive symptoms were present in 27 of the AD patients (48%). Patients with depressive symptoms showed less perfusion in the right superior and bilateral middle frontal gyri (p < 0.005)  left superior frontal (p < 0.05) and anterior cingulate gyri (p < 0.005) before atrophy correction. SPM analyses revealed significantly lower perfusion in bilateral dorsolateral and superior prefrontal cortex of patients with depressive symptoms (right  p < 0.005; left  p < 0.05). SPECT ROI analyses with atrophy correction revealed trends similar to data without atrophy correction but did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSION: In this study  depressive symptoms in AD patients were associated with relative hypoperfusion in the prefrontal cortex when they were compared with AD patients without depressive symptoms. These findings are consistent with previous reports in studies of primary depression suggesting that these regions are involved in affect and emotional regulation.,0,Frontal lobe hypoperfusion and depressive symptoms in Alzheimer disease.BACKGROUND: Depressive symptoms of varying severity are prevalent in up to 63% of Alzheimer disease (AD) patients and often result in greater cognitive decline and increased caregiver burden.

Pediatric onset IBD is a complex phenotype with demonstrated noncompliance risk that may require targeted measures to optimize health care outcomes in the adult care setting. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of posttransfer health care setting (academic versus community gastroenterologist) on emergent health resource utilization. Methods: This was a population-based retrospective cohort study using health care administrative data from Ontario, Canada. A cohort of patients with Pediatric onset IBD was identified and health resource utilization during a 2-year pretransfer period, transfer of care period and 2-year posttransfer period was analyzed. Posttransfer health care setting was defined as academic (i.e., gastroenterologists providing care in a university affiliated tertiary care center) versus community. A third comparator group, loss to follow-up, was also identified. The primary outcome of this study comprised emergency department utilization. Secondary outcomes included hospitalizations, surgeries, ambulatory visits, endoscopic investigations, and radiological investigations. Results: Overall, there were no significant differences found in emergency department use, ambulatory care visits (aside from the expected drop in the lost to follow-up group), hospitalizations, endoscopic procedures, or radiological procedures between exposure groups.

We thus explored how people search for information, how they perceive its credibility, and how all this relates to their engagement in self-protective behaviors in the crucial period right after the onset of COVID-19 epidemic. The online questionnaire was circulated within 48 h after the first case of COVID-19 was confirmed in Slovenia. We gathered information on participants' demographics, perception of the situation, their emotional and behavioral responses to the situation (i.e., self-protective behavior), perceived subjective knowledge, perceived credibility of different sources of information, and their level of trust. We looked into the relationships between perceived credibility and trust, and self-protective behavior of 1,718 participants and found that mass media, social media, and officials received relatively low levels of trust. Conversely, medical professionals and scientists were deemed the most credible. The perceived credibility of received information was linked not only with lower levels of negative emotional responses but also with higher adherence to much needed self-protective measures, which aim to contain the spread of the disease. While results might vary between societies with different levels of trust in relevant governmental and professional institutions, and while variances in self-protective behavior scores explained by our model are modest, even a small increase in self-protective behavior could go a long way in viral epidemics like the one we are facing today.

METHODS: We conducted a 12-month prospective cohort study to examine the cumulative incidence of falls. Participants were evaluated clinically and underwent PiB PET imaging and lumbar puncture. Falls were reported monthly using an individualized calendar journal returned by mail. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to test whether time to first fall was associated with each biomarker and the ratio of CSF tau/Aﾎｲ竄竄 and CSF phosphorylated tau/Aﾎｲ竄竄  after adjustment for common fall risk factors. RESULTS: The sample (n = 125) was predominately female (62.4%) and white (96%) with a mean age of 74.4 years. When controlled for ability to perform activities of daily living  higher levels of PiB retention (hazard ratio = 2.95 [95% confidence interval 1.01-6.45]  p = 0.05) and of CSF biomarker ratios (p < 0.001) were associated with a faster time to first fall.

In this study we used real-time PCR to show that DNM2 mRNA is significantly reduced in the cortex of AD brains and in the peripheral blood of dementia patients. Neuroblastoma cells transfected with a dominant negative DNM2 had increased amyloid beta protein (Abeta) secretion and most of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) in these cells was localized to the plasma membrane. In addition  these cells were rich in flotillin  which is a component of lipid rafts. These data suggest that DNM2 expression is reduced in LOAD  which results in the accumulation of APP in lipid raft-rich plasma membranes.

134,1001,"The role of altered impedance in the pathophysiology of normal pressure hydrocephalus, Alzheimer's disease and syringomyelia.",Normal pressure hydrocephalus  Alzheimer's disease and syringomyelia appear to be completely unrelated diseases  however  they share a reduction in subarachnoid space compliance as part of their pathophysiology. This paper discusses the physiology of pulsatile fluid flow and its relationship to compliance/impedance. Unlike continuous or non-pulsatile flow where the vessel resistance and pressure gradient are the major determinants of the volume of fluid flowing  when the fluid flow in a vessel pulsates then the vessel compliance/impedance becomes important. A reduction in compliance in the craniospinal cavity in each of the three diseases discussed  leads to a limitation of the outflow vessel compliance. Therefore  there is an increase in outflow vessel impedance. The venous blood  CSF and interstitial brain/spinal cord fluid all have significantly pulsatile flow and an increase in the impedance of the fluid outflow in each disease would limit the volume of these fluids as they attempt to cross the subarachnoid space. It is hypothesised that a reduction in the efficiency of the outflow of venous blood  CSF and interstitial brain/spinal cord fluid would lead to the accumulation of CSF in NPH  cord fluid in syringomyelia and delay the excretion of beta amyloid via the interstitial drainage pathways in AD.,0,"The role of altered impedance in the pathophysiology of normal pressure hydrocephalus, Alzheimer's disease and syringomyelia.Normal pressure hydrocephalus  Alzheimer's disease and syringomyelia appear to be completely unrelated diseases  however  they share a reduction in subarachnoid space compliance as part of their pathophysiology.

135,54401,Huntingtin associated protein 1 regulates trafficking of the amyloid precursor protein and modulates amyloid beta levels in neurons.,Amyloid precursor protein (APP) is involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. It is axonally transported  endocytosed and sorted to different cellular compartments where amyloid beta (Aﾎｲ) is produced. However  the mechanism of APP trafficking remains unclear. We present evidence that huntingtin associated protein 1 (HAP1) may reduce Aﾎｲ production by regulating APP trafficking to the non-amyloidogenic pathway. HAP1 and APP are highly colocalized in a number of brain regions  with similar distribution patterns in both mouse and human brains. They are associated with each other  the interacting site is the 371-599 of HAP1. APP is more retained in cis-Golgi  trans-Golgi complex  early endosome and ER-Golgi intermediate compartment in HAP1-/- neurons. HAP1 deletion significantly alters APP endocytosis and reduces the re-insertion of APP into the cytoplasmic membrane. Amyloid precursor protein-YFP(APP-YFP) vesicles in HAP1-/- neurons reveal a decreased trafficking rate and an increased number of motionless vesicles. Knock-down of HAP1 protein in cultured cortical neurons of Alzheimer's disease mouse model increases Aﾎｲ levels. Our data suggest that HAP1 regulates APP subcellular trafficking to the non-amyloidogenic pathway and may negatively regulate Aﾎｲ production in neurons.,0,Huntingtin associated protein 1 regulates trafficking of the amyloid precursor protein and modulates amyloid beta levels in neurons.Amyloid precursor protein (APP) is involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.

In ALS-FTD  extensive temporal hypometabolism is seen in addition to severe diffuse frontal hypometabolism. METHODS: This study analyses FDG-PET findings in 6 ALS patients and 4 ALS-FTD patients. RESULTS: In addition to earlier described areas of hypometabolism in ALS  we found also reduced FDG-PET metabolism in the medial frontal cortex  the orbitofrontal cortex  and the anterior temporal lobe in our ALS patients. The anterolateral area was the best preserved part of the frontal lobe in ALS patients. In ALS-FTD  frontal and temporal hypometabolism was severe (and parietal hypometabolism was often also present) with relatively preserved perirolandic metabolism. CONCLUSION: In ALS  more diffuse frontal and temporal FDG-PET hypometabolism was seen than earlier reported  with the anterolateral area as the best preserved part of the frontal lobe.

Here, we shed light on the role of the personality trait neuroticism in predicting who experiences negative affective responses. In a large-scale experience-sampling study (N = 1,609; 38,120 momentary reports), we showed that individuals high in neuroticism experienced more negative affect and higher affective variability in their daily lives. Individuals high in neuroticism also (a) paid more attention to COVID-19-related information and worried more about the consequences of the pandemic (crisis preoccupation), and (b) experienced more negative affect during this preoccupation (affective reactivity).

Diagnostic radiographers in Gauteng providing chest CT, chest radiograph and MRI services are frontline workers experiencing these unprecedented times. Therefore, this study undertook to explore diagnostic radiographers' experiences of COVID-19. METHODS: A qualitative approach using an asynchronous opened-ended online questionnaire was used to explore diagnostic radiographers' experiences of COVID-19. Responses from purposively sampled diagnostic radiographers in Gauteng SA, underwent thematic analysis. RESULTS: Sixty diagnostic radiographers representing both the private and public health sector responded to the questionnaire. Thematic analysis revealed three themes: new work flow and operations, effect on radiographer well-being and radiographer resilience. CONCLUSION: Besides experiencing a shift in their professional work routine and home/family dynamics, diagnostic radiographers' well-being has also been impacted by COVID-19. Adapting to the ""new way of work"" has been challenging yet their resilience and dedication to their profession, providing quality patient care and skill expertise is their arsenal to combat these challenges.

143,17876,Disruption of corticocortical connections ameliorates amyloid burden in terminal fields in a transgenic model of Abeta amyloidosis.,We demonstrated previously that amyloid precursor protein (APP) is anterogradely transported from the entorhinal cortex (ERC) to the dentate gyrus via axons of the perforant pathway. In the terminal fields of these inputs  APP undergoes proteolysis to generate C-terminal fragments containing the entire amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) domain. The present study was designed to test the hypothesis that APP derived from ERC neurons is the source of the Abeta peptide deposited in the hippocampal dentate gyrus in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and in transgenic mice with Abeta amyloidosis. We used mice harboring two familial AD-linked genes (human APP Swedish and presenilin1-DeltaE9)  in which levels of Abeta (especially Abeta(42)) are elevated  leading to the formation of amyloid plaques  and lesioned the ERC to interrupt the transport of APP from ERC to hippocampus. Our results show that  on the side of ERC lesion  numbers of APP-immunoreactive dystrophic neurites and Abeta burden were significantly reduced by approximately 40 and 45%  respectively  in the dentate gyrus compared with the contralateral side. Reductions in APP and Abeta were more substantial in the molecular layer of the dentate  i.e.  a region that contains the ERC terminals  and were associated with a parallel decrease in total APP and Abeta measured by Western blot and ProteinChip immunoassays. Silver and thioflavine staining confirmed the reduction of amyloid plaques on the side of deafferentation. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that ERC may be the primary source of amyloidogenic Abeta in the dentate gyrus  and they suggest an important role of corticocortical and corticolimbic forward connections in determining patterns of amyloid deposition in AD.,0,Disruption of corticocortical connections ameliorates amyloid burden in terminal fields in a transgenic model of Abeta amyloidosis.We demonstrated previously that amyloid precursor protein (APP) is anterogradely transported from the entorhinal cortex (ERC) to the dentate gyrus via axons of the perforant pathway.

147,16649,Analysis of sampling techniques for imbalanced data: An n = 648 ADNI study.,Many neuroimaging applications deal with imbalanced imaging data. For example  in Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset  the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) cases eligible for the study are nearly two times the Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients for structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) modality and six times the control cases for proteomics modality. Constructing an accurate classifier from imbalanced data is a challenging task. Traditional classifiers that aim to maximize the overall prediction accuracy tend to classify all data into the majority class. In this paper  we study an ensemble system of feature selection and data sampling for the class imbalance problem. We systematically analyze various sampling techniques by examining the efficacy of different rates and types of undersampling  oversampling  and a combination of over and undersampling approaches. We thoroughly examine six widely used feature selection algorithms to identify significant biomarkers and thereby reduce the complexity of the data.

Comprehensive experiments with various settings show that our proposed ensemble model of multiple undersampled datasets yields stable and promising results.,0,Analysis of sampling techniques for imbalanced data: An n = 648 ADNI study.Many neuroimaging applications deal with imbalanced imaging data. For example  in Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset  the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) cases eligible for the study are nearly two times the Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients for structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) modality and six times the control cases for proteomics modality. Constructing an accurate classifier from imbalanced data is a challenging task. Traditional classifiers that aim to maximize the overall prediction accuracy tend to classify all data into the majority class. In this paper  we study an ensemble system of feature selection and data sampling for the class imbalance problem. We systematically analyze various sampling techniques by examining the efficacy of different rates and types of undersampling  oversampling  and a combination of over and undersampling approaches. We thoroughly examine six widely used feature selection algorithms to identify significant biomarkers and thereby reduce the complexity of the data.

148,10683,Activation of glycogen synthase kinase 3beta promotes the intermolecular association of tau. The use of fluorescence resonance energy transfer microscopy.,Tau is hyperphosphorylated and undergoes proteolysis in Alzheimer disease brain. Caspase-cleaved tau efficiently forms fibrillary structures in vitro and in situ. Glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK3beta) phosphorylates tau and induces the aggregation of caspase-cleaved tau in situ. Given the hypothesis that increased association of tau precedes the formation of fibrillar structures  we generated a cell model to quantitate the extent of tau association in situ using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) microscopy. The cyan and yellow fluorescent proteins were attached to full-length (T4) and caspase-cleaved (T4C3) tau at either the N or C termini  and a pair of cyan and yellow fluorescent protein-tagged tau were co-transfected into human embryonic kidney cells. The FRET efficiency was examined in the presence of a constitutively active or a kinase-dead GSK3beta. Active GSK3beta significantly increased FRET efficiency with both T4 and T4C3  indicating that GSK3beta activation resulted in an increase in the self-association of both T4 and T4C3  but interestingly only T4 is efficiently phosphorylated by GSK3beta. There was no significant difference in FRET efficiency between T4 and T4C3  although only T4C3 in the presence of active GSK3beta leads to the formation of Sarkosyl-insoluble inclusions. These FRET studies demonstrate that GSK3beta facilitates the association of T4 and T4C3  and the presence of caspase-cleaved tau is necessary for the evolution of tau oligomers into Sarkosyl-insoluble inclusions even though it is not extensively phosphorylated. These data imply that increased association of tau should not be regarded as a direct indicator of the formation of insoluble tau aggregates.,0,Activation of glycogen synthase kinase 3beta promotes the intermolecular association of tau.

149,40191,A case of acute epiglottitis in an adult caused by haemophilus influenzae serotype a,INTRODUCTION: Acute epiglottis is a supraglottic inflammation of the oropharynx that may lead to life-threatening airway obstruction. It is classically associated with H. influenzae serotype b (HiB) in children. With the advent of the HiB vaccine in 1985  pediatric cases have dramatically declined. We described a case of acute epiglotitis in an adult caused by H. influenzae serotype a. CASE PRESENTATION: A 38-year-old woman with a history of untreated hepatitis C presented to the emergency department with two-day history of throat pain  difficulty swallowing  and breathing that acutely worsened over several hours. She also noted neck tenderness and swelling. Her children were acutely ill with upper respiratory symptoms several days prior to her symptoms. She also had dental work done two weeks prior. She was up-to-date with her HiB vaccine. She was afebrile and her vitals were unremarkable. She appeared in mild distress and her voice was weak. Exam showed bilateral neck swelling with marked tenderness on palpation. She had good dentition with no peritonsillar abscess  tongue edema. A lateral neck radiograph showed narrowing of the airway with a “thumb sign” as shown in the figure. Laryngoscopic examination demonstrated significant pooling of secretions with erythematous and enlarged epiglottis. The airway was significantly narrowed but patent. Laboratory studies were significant for mild leukocytosis. CT of the neck showed diffuse uniform swelling of the epiglottis with no evidence of deep neck abscess. She was admitted to the intensive care unit and underwent elective nasotracheal intubation. She was started on IV steroids  IV ampicillin/sulbactam. Rapid testing for Streptococcus group A was negative. Nasopharyngeal swab for influenza A and B  and RSV PCR were negative. She was clinically improving and was extubated 48 hours later. Blood cultures grew H.influenzae  beta-lactamase negative  serotype a. Throat culture was negative. HIV antibody screen and viral load were negative. DISCUSSION: This case illustrates the importance of having high index suspicion of possible causes of acute epiglotitis in adults. H. influenzae remains the majority of causative organism in childhood cases of acute epiglotitis. It is however  still a highly potential causative organism in adult cases. Severe fatal cases caused by H.influenza type a in the form of meningitis  pneumonia  and sepsis have been reported  particularly in those with compromised immune system or age greater than 50 years old. Comprehensive work-up to rule out other organisms are necessary and direct laryngoscopic examination remains the gold standard in diagnosing adults with suspected epiglotitis. CONCLUSIONS: An astute medical diagnosis and proper treatment can potentially help avoid severe outcomes in patient with acute epiglottis.,0,A case of acute epiglottitis in an adult caused by haemophilus influenzae serotype aINTRODUCTION: Acute epiglottis is a supraglottic inflammation of the oropharynx that may lead to life-threatening airway obstruction.

150,25629,Computational Determination of Potential Inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease,"The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has infected several million people and caused thousands of deaths worldwide since Dec 2019. As the disease is spreading rapidly all over the world, it is urgent to find effective drugs to treat the virus. The main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2 is one of the potential drug targets. Therefore, in this context, we used rigorous computational methods, including molecular docking, fast pulling of ligand (FPL), and free energy perturbation (FEP), to investigate potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. We first tested our approach with three reported inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro; and our computational results are in good agreement with the respective experimental data. Subsequently, we applied our approach on a databases of ~4600 natural compounds, as well as 8 available HIV-1 protease (PR) inhibitors and an aza-peptide epoxide. Molecular docking resulted in a short list of 35 natural compounds, which was subsequently refined using the FPL scheme. FPL simulations resulted in five potential inhibitors, including 3 natural compounds and two available HIV-1 PR inhibitors. Finally, FEP, the most accurate and precise method, was used to determine the absolute binding free energy of these five compounds. FEP results indicate that two natural compounds, cannabisin A and isoacteoside, and an HIV-1 PR inhibitor, darunavir, exhibit large binding free energy to SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, which is larger than that of 13b, the most reliable SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitor recently reported. The binding free energy largely arises from van der Waals interaction. We also found that Glu166 form H-bonds to all the inhibitors. Replacing Glu166 by an alanine residue leads to ~ 2.0 kcal/mol decreases in the affinity of darunavir to SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. Our results could contribute to the development of potentials drugs inhibiting SARS-CoV-2.",0,"Computational Determination of Potential Inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Main ProteaseThe novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has infected several million people and caused thousands of deaths worldwide since Dec 2019.

151,8420,Characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 in patients with HIV: a multicentre research network study,"OBJECTIVE: We studied clinical outcomes of COVID-19 infection in patients living with HIV (PLH) in comparison to non-HIV population. DESIGN: Analysis of a multicentre research network TriNETX was performed including patients more than 10 years of age diagnosed with COVID-19. METHOD(S): Outcomes in COVID-19 positive patients with concurrent HIV (PLH) were compared with a propensity-matched cohort of patients without HIV (non-PLH). RESULT(S): Fifty thousand one hundred and sixty-seven patients with COVID-19 were identified (49,763 non-PLH, 404 PLH). PLH were more likely to be men, African-American, obese and have concurrent hypertension, diabetes, chronic kidney disease and nicotine dependence compared with non-PLH cohort (all P values <0.05). We performed 1 : 1 matching for BMI, diabetes, hypertension, chronic lung diseases, chronic kidney disease, race, history of nicotine dependence and sex. In unmatched analysis, PLH had higher mortality at 30 days [risk ratio 1.55, 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 1.01-2.39] and were more likely to need inpatient services (risk ratio 1.83, 95% CI: 1.496-2.24). After propensity score matching, no difference in mortality was noted (risk ratio 1.33, 95% CI: 0.69-2.57).

Mean C-reactive protein, ferritin, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and lactate dehydrogenase levels after COVID-19 diagnosis were not statistically different and mortality was not different for PLH with a history of antiretroviral treatment. CONCLUSION(S): Crude COVID-19 mortality is higher in PLH; however, propensity-matched analyses revealed no difference in outcomes, showing that higher mortality is driven by higher burden of comorbidities.

152,67092,Present and potential future issues in glioblastoma treatment,The treatment of glioblastomas requires a multidisciplinary approach that takes the presently incurable nature of the disease into consideration. Treatments are multimodal and include surgery  radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Current recommendations are that patients with glioblastomas should undergo maximum surgical resection  followed by concurrent radiation and chemotherapy with the novel alkylating drug temozolomide. This is then to be followed by additional adjuvant temozolomide for a period of up to 6 months. Major advances in surgical and imaging technologies used to treat glioblastoma patients are described. These technologies include magnetic resonance imaging and metabolic data that are helpful in the diagnosis and guiding of surgical resection. However  glioblastomas almost invariably recur near their initial sites. Disease progression usually occurs within 6 months and leads rapidly to death. A number of signaling pathways can be activated constitutively in migrating glioma cells  thus rendering these cells resistant to proapoptotic insults  such as conventional chemotherapies. Therefore  the molecular and cellular therapies and local drug delivery that could be used to complement conventional treatments are described  and some of the currently ongoing clinical trials are reviewed  with respect to these new approaches. ﾂｩ 2006 Future Drugs Ltd,0,Present and potential future issues in glioblastoma treatmentThe treatment of glioblastomas requires a multidisciplinary approach that takes the presently incurable nature of the disease into consideration.

Since most glycosyltransferases show Golgi localization and many of these are cleaved and secreted from the cell  we hypothesized that other glycosyltransferases may also be BACE1 substrates. Here  we focused on a series of sialyltransferases as candidates for BACE1 substrates. We found that BACE1 cleaved polysialyltransferase ST8Sia IV (PST) in vitro. We further found that BACE1 overexpression in COS cells enhanced the secretion of ST3Gal I  II  III and IV  although these sialyltransferases were not cleaved by BACE1 in vitro.

Currently  [<sup>18F</sup>]FDG is commonly used in the field of clinical diagnosis  because it can provide qualitative information on malignancy and metastasis of tumor. Since its achievement  much effort has been devoted to the development of radiopharmaceuticals that bind or interact with the in vivo biomarkers. For example  a number of radiopharmaceuticals based on proteins and peptides with high binding affinities to various biomarkers have been applied for the diagnosis of tumor  arteriosclerosis  thrombus and so on. Furthermore  Alzheimer's disease is also a major target for diagnosis by PET/SPECT imaging. The development of low-molecular-weight radiolabeled probes for the quantitation of β-amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer's brains is a topic of current PET/SPECT imaging studies. Here  some recent progress and development of radiopharmaceuticals for PET/SPECT imaging will be reviewed. © 2009 The Pharmaceutical Society of Japan.,"{'judgement': 'False', 'index': 157}",0,"{'judgement': 'False', 'index': 157}",0,"{'judgement': 'False', 'index': 157}",0

159,38059,Decreased beta-amyloid1-42 and increased tau levels in cerebrospinal fluid of patients with Alzheimer disease.,CONTEXT: Alzheimer disease (AD) is characterized by pathological results at autopsy of amyloid plaques and tau-associated neurofibrillary tangles  but the clinical diagnosis of AD is determined on the basis of medical history  cognitive symptoms  and exclusionary criteria. The search for antemortem biomarkers is intense and has focused on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) beta-amyloid1-42 and tau proteins. OBJECTIVES: To compare CSF beta-amyloid and tau levels in a new population of AD patients and controls. To perform a meta-analysis of studies of CSF beta-amyloid and tau levels in AD patients and controls. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study of the comparison of baseline CSF beta-amyloid1-42 and tau levels in AD patients and controls. Meta-analysis involved 17 studies of CSF beta-amyloid and 34 studies of CSF tau. SETTING: Clinical research unit of the National Institute of Mental Health  Bethesda  Md. PATIENTS: The Geriatric Psychiatry Branch evaluated AD patients as inpatients at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center between May 1985 and January 2001. A total of 203 patients participated in this study (131 with AD and 72 controls). None had other serious illnesses  and 31 of 131 AD cases had AD confirmed at autopsy. Meta-analysis provided an additional 3133 AD patients and 1481 controls. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Levels of CSF beta-amyloid1-42 were measured by a sandwich enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay with a polyclonal capture antibody and a monoclonal detection antibody. Levels of CSF tau were measured with a standard commercial immunoassay. RESULTS: Levels of CSF beta-amyloid1-42 were significantly lower in the AD patients vs controls (mean [SD]  183 [121] pg/mL vs 491 [245] pg/mL; P<.001). Levels of CSF tau were significantly higher in AD patients (mean [SD]  587 [365] pg/mL vs 244 [156] pg/mL; P<.001). The cutpoints of 444 pg/mL for CSF beta-amyloid1-42 and 195 pg/mL for CSF tau gave a sensitivity and specificity of 92% and 89%  respectively  to distinguish AD patients from controls  which is comparable with rates with clinical diagnosis. Meta-analyses of studies comparing CSF beta-amyloid and tau levels in AD participants and controls confirmed an overall difference between levels in these 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS: Alzheimer disease is associated with a significant decrease in CSF beta-amyloid1-42 levels along with an increase in CSF tau levels. These findings suggest that the 2 measures are biological markers of AD pathophysiology. While these CSF measures may have a potential clinical utility as biomarkers of disease  the preliminary and retrospective nature of the findings  the absence of assay standardization  and the lack of comparison patient populations must be addressed in future studies testing the usefulness of these CSF measures for predictive  diagnostic  or treatment evaluation purposes.,0,Decreased beta-amyloid1-42 and increased tau levels in cerebrospinal fluid of patients with Alzheimer disease.CONTEXT: Alzheimer disease (AD) is characterized by pathological results at autopsy of amyloid plaques and tau-associated neurofibrillary tangles  but the clinical diagnosis of AD is determined on the basis of medical history  cognitive symptoms  and exclusionary criteria.

This study estimated the impact of COVID-19 on the behavior of the financial markets of Europe and the US. The results revealed that the returns of the S&P 500 index have been greatly affected by a lockdown in the US owing to COVID-19. However, the health crisis generated due to the novel coronavirus significantly decreased the stock returns of the Nasdaq Composite index. The results also showed that the economic crisis generated from the pandemic in Spain has had more impact on the IBEX 35 as compared to the health crisis itself. On the other hand, in the long-run, Italy's stock markets are more affected by the health crisis as contrasted with the economic crisis, while, in the short-run, both lockdown conditions and economic instability lower the stock returns of FTSE MIB. The UK stock markets witnessed that in the short-run, deficiency of health management systems imperatively damaged the stock returns of the London Stock Exchange. The investigation revealed that deficiency of health systems and lockdown conditions have imperatively damaged the structure of financial markets, inferring that sustainable development of these nations is at risk due to COVID-19.

162,45891,A new in vivo method to study P-glycoprotein transport in tumors and the blood-brain barrier,Drug resistance is a major cause of chemotherapy failure in cancer treatment. One reason is the overexpression of the drug efflux pump P- glycoprotein (P-gp)  involved in multidrug resistance (MDR). In vivo pharmacokinetic analysis of P-gp transport might identify the capacity of modulation by P-gp substrate modulators  such as cyclosporin A. Therefore  P- gp function was measured in vivo with positron emission tomography (PET) and [11C]verapamil as radiolabeled P-gp substrate. Studies were performed in rats bearing tumors bilaterally  a P-gp-negative small cell lung carcinoma (GLC4) and its P-gp-overexpressing subline (GLC4/P-gp). For validation  in vitro and biodistribution studies with [11C]daunorubicin and [11C]verapamil were performed. [11C]Daunorubicin and [11C]verapamil accumulation were higher in GLC4 than in GLC4/P-gp cells. These levels were increased after modulation with cyclosporin A in GLC4/P-gp. Biodistribution studies showed 159% and 185% higher levels of [11C]daunorubicin and [11C]verapamil  respectively  in GLC4 than in GLC4/P-gp tumors. After cyclosporin A  [11C]daunorubicin and [11C]verapamil content in the GLC4/P-gp tumor was raised to the level of GLC4 tumors. PET measurements demonstrated a lower [11C]verapamil content in GLC4/P-gp tumors compared with GLC4 tumors. Pretreatment with cyclosporin A increased [11C]verapamil levels in GLC4/P-gp tumors (184%) and in brains (1280%). This pharmacokinetic effect was clearly visualized with PET. These results show the feasibility of in vivo P-gp function measurement under basal conditions and after modulation in solid tumors and in the brain. Therefore  PET and radiolabeled P-gp substrates may be useful as a clinical tool to select patients who might benefit from the addition of a P-gp modulator to MDR drugs,0,A new in vivo method to study P-glycoprotein transport in tumors and the blood-brain barrierDrug resistance is a major cause of chemotherapy failure in cancer treatment.

164,67526,Combining PET images and neuropsychological test data for automatic diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.,In recent years  several approaches to develop computer aided diagnosis (CAD) systems for dementia have been proposed. Some of these systems analyze neurological brain images by means of machine learning algorithms in order to find the patterns that characterize the disorder  and a few combine several imaging modalities to improve the diagnostic accuracy. However  they usually do not use neuropsychological testing data in that analysis. The purpose of this work is to measure the advantages of using not only neuroimages as data source in CAD systems for dementia but also neuropsychological scores. To this aim  we compared the accuracy rates achieved by systems that use neuropsychological scores beside the imaging data in the classification step and systems that use only one of these data sources. In order to address the small sample size problem and facilitate the data combination  a dimensionality reduction step (implemented using three different algorithms) was also applied on the imaging data. After each image is summarized in a reduced set of image features  the data sources were combined and classified using three different data combination approaches and a Support Vector Machine classifier. That way  by testing different dimensionality reduction methods and several data combination approaches  we aim not only highlighting the advantages of using neuropsychological scores in the classification  but also implementing the most accurate computer system for early dementia detention. The accuracy of the CAD systems were estimated using a database with records from 46 subjects  diagnosed with MCI or AD. A peak accuracy rate of 89% was obtained. In all cases the accuracy achieved using both  neuropsychological scores and imaging data  was substantially higher than the one obtained using only the imaging data.,0,Combining PET images and neuropsychological test data for automatic diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.In recent years  several approaches to develop computer aided diagnosis (CAD) systems for dementia have been proposed.

165,18861,Rapid Increase in Telemental Health Within the Department of Veterans Affairs During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Background: The use of telemental health via videoconferencing (TMH-V) became critical during the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic due to restriction of non-urgent in-person appointments. The current brief report demonstrates the rapid growth in TMH-V appointments in the weeks following the pandemic declaration within the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), the largest healthcare system in the United States. Methods: COVID-19 changes in TMH-V appointments were captured during the six weeks following the World Health Organization's pandemic declaration (March 11, 2020-April 22, 2020). Pre-COVID-19 TMH-V encounters were assessed from October 1, 2017 to March 10, 2020. Results: Daily TMH-V encounters rose from 1,739 on March 11 to 11,406 on April 22 (556% growth, 222,349 total encounters). Between March 11-April 22, 114,714 patients were seen via TMH-V, and 77.5% were first-time TMH-V users. 12,342 MH providers completed a TMH-V appointment between March 11-April 22, and 34.7% were first-time TMH-V users. The percentage growth of TMH-V appointments was higher than the rise in telephone appointments (442% growth); in-person appointments dropped by 81% during this time period. Discussion and Conclusions: The speed of VA's growth in TMH-V appointments in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic was facilitated by its pre-existing telehealth infrastructure, including earlier national efforts to increase the number of providers using TMH-V. Longstanding barriers to TMH-V implementation were lessened in the context of a pandemic, during which non-urgent in-person MH care was drastically reduced.

169,6884,COVID-19 Ischemic Strokes as an Emerging Rehabilitation Population: A Case Series,"There is emerging literature that coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) infections result in an increased incidence of thrombosis secondary to a prothrombotic state. Initial studies reported ischemic strokes primarily occurring in the critically ill COVID-19 population. However, there have been reports of ischemic strokes as the presenting symptom in young non-critically ill COVID-19 patients without significant risk factors. Further characterization of the COVID-19 stroke population is needed. We present four cases of COVID-19 ischemic strokes occurring in patients 37 to 68 years of age with varying COVID-19 infection severities, premorbid risk factors, clinical presentations (e.g. focal and non-focal), and vascular distributions. These cases highlight the heterogeneity of COVID-19 ischemic strokes. The duration of the COVID-19 related prothrombotic state is unknown and it is unclear if patients are at risk for recurrent strokes. With more COVID-19 patients recovering and being discharged to rehabilitation, physiatric awareness of this prothrombotic state and increased incidence of ischemic strokes is essential. Due to the variable presentation of COVID-19 ischemic strokes, clinicians can consider neuroimaging as part of the evaluation in COVID-19 patients with either acute focal or non-focal neurologic symptoms. Additional studies are needed to clarify prothrombotic state duration, determine prognosis for recovery, and establish the physiatrist's role in long term disease management.",0,"COVID-19 Ischemic Strokes as an Emerging Rehabilitation Population: A Case SeriesThere is emerging literature that coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) infections result in an increased incidence of thrombosis secondary to a prothrombotic state.

Further characterization of the COVID-19 stroke population is needed. We present four cases of COVID-19 ischemic strokes occurring in patients 37 to 68 years of age with varying COVID-19 infection severities, premorbid risk factors, clinical presentations (e.g. focal and non-focal), and vascular distributions. These cases highlight the heterogeneity of COVID-19 ischemic strokes. The duration of the COVID-19 related prothrombotic state is unknown and it is unclear if patients are at risk for recurrent strokes. With more COVID-19 patients recovering and being discharged to rehabilitation, physiatric awareness of this prothrombotic state and increased incidence of ischemic strokes is essential. Due to the variable presentation of COVID-19 ischemic strokes, clinicians can consider neuroimaging as part of the evaluation in COVID-19 patients with either acute focal or non-focal neurologic symptoms. Additional studies are needed to clarify prothrombotic state duration, determine prognosis for recovery, and establish the physiatrist's role in long term disease management.","{'judgement': 'False', 'index': 169}",0,"{'judgement': 'False', 'index': 169}",0,"{'judgement': 'False', 'index': 169}",0

Design: Analysis of patients in the Coracle registry from February 22, 2020, to April 1, 2020. Setting: Hospitals in the Piedmont, Lombardy, Tuscany, and Lazio regions of Italy. Patients: Nine-hundred forty-eight patients hospitalized for coronavirus disease 2019. Interventions: None. Measurements and Main Results: Among 948 patients, 122 (12.87%) received invasive ventilation, 637 (67.19%) received supplemental oxygen only, and 189 (19.94%) received no respiratory support. The median (quartile 1-quartile 3) age was 65 years (54-76.59 yr), and there was evidence of differential respiratory treatment by decade of life (p = 0.0046); patients greater than 80 years old were generally not intubated. There were 606 men (63.9%) in this study, and they were more likely to receive respiratory support than women (p < 0.0001). The rate of in-hospital death for invasive ventilation recipients was 22.95%, 12.87% for supplemental oxygen recipients, and 7.41% for those who received neither (p = 0.0004).

171,59846,Diabetes increases the mortality of patients with COVID-19: a meta-analysis,"AIMS: Nowadays, the ongoing pandemic of COVID-19 caused by the novel coronavirus Syndrome-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an emerging, rapidly evolving situation. Complications such as hypertension, diabetes, COPD, cardiovascular disease, and cerebrovascular disease are major risk factors for patients with COVID-19. METHODS: No meta-analysis has explored if or not diabetes related to mortality of patients with COVID-19. Therefore, this meta-analysis first aims to explore the possible clinical mortality between diabetes and COVID-19, analyze if diabetes patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 are exposed to the worst clinical prognostic risk, and to evaluate the reliability of the evidence. RESULTS: Our results showed a close relationship between diabetes and mortality of COVID-19, with a pooled OR of 1.75 (95% CI 1.31-2.36; P = 0.0002). The pooled data were calculated with the fixed effects model (FEM) as no heterogeneity appeared in the studies. Sensitivity analysis showed that after omitting any single study or converting a random effect model to FEM, the main results still held. CONCLUSIONS: Our meta-analysis showed that diabetes increases the mortality of patients with COVID-19. These results indicated the disturbance of blood glucose in the COVID-19 patients.

Patients are often mistaken to suffer from Parkinson's disease (PD) or Alzheimer's disease (AD) because of the overlapping clinical appearances concerning cognition and movement. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the possibility for a valid differential diagnosis using cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers. METHODS: In the context of a large retrospective study  we analyzed data of patients suffering from degenerative  ischemic  or inflammatory CNS (central nervous system) diseases and identified those with DLB (n = 34)  PD (n = 37)  and AD (n = 47) for further analyses. RESULTS: We detected abnormalities in the CSF profiles of those patients with DLB while using a combination of decreased amyloid-ﾎｲ (Aﾎｲ)42 and increased tau levels. By stratification of data by disease severity  we observed a high sensitivity of this combination especially in the subgroup of patients with advanced stages  while the sensitivity in early forms was lower. In addition  with clinical deterioration  the abnormalities in the CSF profile became more pronounced. CONCLUSION: We conclude that DLB can be distinguished from PD  in spite of both being synucleinopathies  by CSF profiles using neurodegenerative marker analysis. The pathophysiology of increased tau and decreased Aﾎｲ levels in those conditions has to be elucidated further  since both proteins are known to be involved in the pathogenesis of AD  but no clear explanation has been postulated for DLB yet.,0,"Using cerebrospinal fluid marker profiles in clinical diagnosis of dementia with Lewy bodies, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease.BACKGROUND: Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is difficult to differentiate from other neuro-degenerative diseases.

178,5317,Serum CCL17 level becomes a predictive marker to distinguish between mild/moderate and severe/critical disease in patients with COVID-19,"COVID-19, a novel coronavirus-related illness, has spread worldwide. Patients with apparently mild/moderate symptoms can suddenly develop severe pneumonia. Therefore, almost all COVID-19 patients require hospitalization, which can reduce limited medical resources in addition to overwhelming medical facilities. To identify predictive markers for the development of severe pneumonia, a comprehensive analysis of serum chemokines and cytokines was conducted using serial serum samples from COVID-19 patients. The expression profiles were analyzed along the time axis. Serum samples of common diseases were enrolled from a BioBank to confirm the usefulness of predictive markers. Five factors, IFN-lambda3, IL-6, IP-10, CXCL9, and CCL17, were identified as predicting the onset of severe/critical symptoms. The factors were classified into two categories. Category A included IFN-lambda3, IL-6, IP-10, and CXCL9, and their values surged and decreased rapidly before the onset of severe pneumonia. Category B included CCL17, which provided complete separation between the mild/moderate and the severe/critical groups at an early phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The five markers provided a high predictive value (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC): 0.9-1.0, p < 0.001). Low expression of CCL17 was specifically observed in pre-severe COVID-19 patients compared with other common diseases, and the predictive ability of CCL17 was confirmed in validation samples of COVID-19. The factors identified could be promising prognostic markers to distinguish between mild/moderate and severe/critical patients, enabling triage at an early phase of infection, thus avoiding overwhelming medical facilities.

Here, we report the experience of one clinic that converted its outpatient care from personal appointments to telemedicine services. Method(s): Documentations of telephone contacts and telemedicine consultations at the Epilepsy Center Frankfurt Rhine-Main were recorded in detail between March and May 2020 and analyzed for acceptance, feasibility, and satisfaction of the conversion from personal to telemedicine appointments from both patients' and medical professionals' perspectives. Result(s): Telephone contacts for 272 patients (mean age: 38.7 years, range: 17-79 years, 55.5% female) were analyzed. Patient-rated medical needs were either very urgent (6.6%, n = 18), urgent (23.5%, n = 64), less urgent (29.8%, n = 81), or nonurgent (39.3%, n = 107). Outpatient service cancelations resulted in a lack of understanding (9.6%, n = 26) or anger and aggression (2.9%, n = 8) in a minority of patients, while 88.6% (n = 241) reacted with understanding, or relief (3.3%, n = 9). Telemedicine consultations rather than a postponed face-to-face visit were requested by 109 patients (40.1%), and these requests were significantly associated with subjective threat by SARS-CoV-2 (p = 0.004), urgent or very urgent medical needs (p = 0.004), and female gender (p = 0.024). Telemedicine satisfaction by patients and physicians was high. Overall, 9.2% (n = 10) of patients reported general supply problems due to SARS-CoV-2, and 28.4% (n = 31) reported epilepsy-specific problems, most frequently related to prescriptions, or supply problems for antiseizure drugs (ASDs; 22.9%, n = 25).

183,39497,Progressive sleep and electroencephalogram changes in mice carrying the Huntington's disease mutation.,Sleep disturbances in Huntington's disease may be deleterious to the cognitive performance  affective behaviour  and general well-being of patients  but a comprehensive description of the progression of changes in sleep and electroencephalogram in Huntington's disease has never been conducted. Here we studied sleep and electroencephalogram disturbances in a transgenic mouse model of Huntington's disease (R6/2 mice). We implanted 10 R6/2 mice and five wild-type littermates with electromyography electrodes  frontofrontal and frontoparietal electroencephalogram electrodes and then recorded sleep/wake behaviour at presymptomatic  symptomatic and late stages of the disease. In addition to sleep-wake scoring  we performed a spectral analysis of the sleep electroencephalogram. We found that sleep and electroencephalogram were already significantly disrupted in R6/2 mice at 9 weeks of age (presymptomatic stage). By the time they were symptomatic  R6/2 mice were unable to maintain long periods of wakefulness and had an increased propensity for rapid eye movement sleep. In addition  the peak frequency of theta rhythm was shifted progressively from 7 Hz to 6 Hz during rapid eye movement sleep  whereas slow wave activity decreased gradually during non-rapid eye movement sleep. Finally  as the disease progressed  an abnormal electroencephalogram gamma activity (30-40 Hz) emerged in R6/2 mice irrespective of sleep states. This is reminiscent of the increased gamma power described in schizophrenic patients during sleep and events of psychosis. Gaining a better understanding of sleep and electroencephalogram changes in patients with Huntington's disease should be a priority  since it will enable clinicians to initiate appropriate investigations and to instigate treatments that could dramatically improve patients' quality of life.,0,Progressive sleep and electroencephalogram changes in mice carrying the Huntington's disease mutation.Sleep disturbances in Huntington's disease may be deleterious to the cognitive performance  affective behaviour  and general well-being of patients  but a comprehensive description of the progression of changes in sleep and electroencephalogram in Huntington's disease has never been conducted.

Studies are needed to inform evidence-based infection prevention and control (IP&C) policies. Objective: To describe the outcomes of neonates born to mothers with perinatal SARS-CoV-2 infection and the IP&C practices associated with these outcomes. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective cohort analysis reviewed the medical records for maternal and newborn data for all 101 neonates born to 100 mothers positive for or with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection from March 13 to April 24, 2020. Testing for SARS-CoV-2 was performed using Cobas (Roche Diagnostics) or Xpert Xpress (Cepheid) assays. Newborns were admitted to well-baby nurseries (WBNs) (82 infants) and neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) (19 infants) in 2 affiliate hospitals at a large academic medical center in New York, New York. Newborns from the WBNs roomed-in with their mothers, who were required to wear masks. Direct breastfeeding after appropriate hygiene was encouraged. Exposures: Perinatal exposure to maternal asymptomatic/mild vs severe/critical COVID-19. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was newborn SARS-CoV-2 testing results. Maternal COVID-19 status was classified as asymptomatic/mildly symptomatic vs severe/critical. Newborn characteristics and clinical courses were compared across maternal COVID-19 severity. Results: In total, 141 tests were obtained from 101 newborns (54 girls [53.5%]) on 0 to 25 days of life (DOL-0 to DOL-25) (median, DOL-1; interquartile range [IQR], DOL-1 to DOL-3). Two newborns had indeterminate test results, indicative of low viral load (2.0%; 95% CI, 0.2%-7.0%); 1 newborn never underwent retesting but remained well on follow-up, and the other had negative results on retesting. Maternal severe/critical COVID-19 was associated with newborns born approximately 1 week earlier (median gestational age, 37.9 [IQR, 37.1-38.4] vs 39.1 [IQR, 38.3-40.2] weeks; P = .02) and at increased risk of requiring phototherapy (3 of 10 [30.0%] vs 6 of 91 [7.0%]; P = .04) compared with newborns of mothers with asymptomatic/mild COVID-19.

186,9870,Overexpression of amyloid precursor protein induces susceptibility to oxidative stress in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells.,In Alzheimer's disease amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) produced from amyloid precursor protein (APP) is considered to induce cell death. To clarify the molecular mechanism underlying Abeta neurotoxicity  we established the cell line overexpressing wild or mutant (His684Arg) APP in human SH-SY5Y cells. This paper presents that overexpression of wild-APP in the cells (SH/w-APP) increased the levels of APP and Abeta(1-40) but not Abeta(1-42)  and reduced Bcl-2 level and proteasome activity with increased susceptibility to oxidative stress. The intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species in SH/w-APP increased significantly by H(2)O(2) treatment. The level of Bcl-2 protein  but not mRNA  was markedly decreased in SH/w-APP cells  which was inversely correlated with APP expression among subcloned SH/w-APP cells. These results indicate that increased expression of wild type APP renders neuronal cells more vulnerable to oxidative stress leading to cell death.,0,Overexpression of amyloid precursor protein induces susceptibility to oxidative stress in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells.In Alzheimer's disease amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) produced from amyloid precursor protein (APP) is considered to induce cell death.

187,13462,Evidence for natural antisense transcript-mediated inhibition of microRNA function.,BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have the potential to regulate diverse sets of mRNA targets. In addition  mammalian genomes contain numerous natural antisense transcripts  most of which appear to be non-protein-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). We have recently identified and characterized a highly conserved non-coding antisense transcript for beta-secretase-1 (BACE1)  a critical enzyme in Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology. The BACE1-antisense transcript is markedly up-regulated in brain samples from Alzheimer's disease patients and promotes the stability of the (sense) BACE1 transcript. RESULTS: We report here that BACE1-antisense prevents miRNA-induced repression of BACE1 mRNA by masking the binding site for miR-485-5p. Indeed  miR-485-5p and BACE1-antisense compete for binding within the same region in the open reading frame of the BACE1 mRNA. We observed opposing effects of BACE1-antisense and miR-485-5p on BACE1 protein in vitro and showed that Locked Nucleic Acid-antimiR mediated knockdown of miR-485-5p as well as BACE1-antisense over-expression can prevent the miRNA-induced BACE1 suppression. We found that the expression of BACE1-antisense as well as miR-485-5p are dysregulated in RNA samples from Alzheimer's disease subjects compared to control individuals. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate an interface between two distinct groups of regulatory RNAs in the computation of BACE1 gene expression. Moreover  bioinformatics analyses revealed a theoretical basis for many other potential interactions between natural antisense transcripts and miRNAs at the binding sites of the latter.,0,Evidence for natural antisense transcript-mediated inhibition of microRNA function.BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have the potential to regulate diverse sets of mRNA targets.

Neurophysiology centers had to suddenly reschedule their activities, with a lack of specific recommendations about electroencephalography (EEG) execution. During the pandemic phase 1, we launched an online survey to understand the flaws and strengths of the EEG management in Italy at the time of Covid-19 pandemic. METHODS: A 45-item online survey (published from April 16 to 30, 2020), endorsed by the Italian Society of Clinical Neurophysiology (SINC), the Italian League Against epilepsy (LICE), and the Italian Association of Neurophysiology technologists (AITN), collected EEG management data (EEG's number and type, indications, personnel and patients safety, devices' sanification) during the Covid-19 pandemic. RESULTS: We received responses from 206 centers. The number of EEGs performed was reduced by 76 +/- 20%, and several types of specific EEG (video-EEG, ambulatory-EEG, LTM, polysomnography) were reduced at a minimum. Half of the centers performed inpatient EEGs only for urgencies. Repetitive seizures, encephalitis, and non-convulsive status epilepticus were the most common indications. Covid-19-positive patients received less EEG than negative ones (p < 0.0001). EEG requests came mainly not only from neurologists (n = 176) but also from general practitioners (n = 40), emergentists (n = 79), intensivists (n = 72), and other specialists (n = 53). Those centers which continued performing outpatient EEG examinations were instructed to perform the EEG after a Covid-19-related symptom screening for patients and using personal protective equipment (PPE) through all the procedure. Inpatient EEGs were performed using FFP2/FFP3 masks by neurophysiology technologists in only 50% of cases. Patients executed hyperventilation only for real clinical needs, but often (56%) with a mask. CONCLUSIONS: Italian neurophysiology centers strongly adhered to government restrictions of lockdown.

As GFAP and S-100B are expressed in different cell populations  variable cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations of these proteins might reflect disease-specific pathological profiles. Therefore we investigated CSF of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD)  patients with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD)  and non-demented control patients (CON). Measurement of GFAP and S-100B in CSF was performed by commercially available ELISA. Our results show that  in AD  there are significantly higher levels of GFAP concentrations  compared to CON (p = 0.001) and CJD patients (p = 0.009)  whereas S-100B is much higher in CJD  compared to AD (p = 0.001) and CON (p = 0.001). In conclusion  GFAP and S-100B represent astroglial markers and the different levels of these proteins in CSF of AD and CJD patients might point to a distinct pathophysiological involvement in these diseases. Apart from pathophysiological aspects  GFAP in particular might serve as an additional diagnostic tool for AD  due to the fact that this protein does not correlate to established markers like tau and amyloid-beta such that analysis of GFAP may be useful for further differential diagnostic approaches in neurodegenerative diseases.,0,Glial fibrillary acidic protein and protein S-100B: different concentration pattern of glial proteins in cerebrospinal fluid of patients with Alzheimer's disease and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and protein S-100B are established indicators of astrogliosis in neuropathology.

Methods: Simultaneous to intravenous injection of 265 MBq of 11C-TYR  dynamic PET acquisition was started and continued for 50 min. Arterial samples were taken and analyzed for 11C-TYR and metabolites. Based on this data  a model was proposed and the corresponding PSR calculated. Results: Plasma metabolites were 11CO2  11C-proteins and 11C-L-DOPA  constituting more than 50% of total plasma radioactivity at 40 min postinjection. Plasma 11CO2 reached a plateau of around 25% of total plasma radioactivity at 20 min postinjection. Plasma 11C-protein was not detected before 10 min postinjection  but increased exponentially afterwards to 20% at 40 min postinjection. Plasma 11C-L-DOPA was the only acid-soluble radioactive metabolite detected and was less than 8% at 40 min postinjection. Using a five-compartment model  it was shown that while the net PSR was dependent on the recycling of amino acids from protein  the amino acid incorporation was not  which was thus used for subsequent analysis. It was found that our curve-fitting results were unreliable due to the exchange of 11C-TYR between plasma and erythrocytes whereas the graphical Patlak-Gjedde analysis is hardly influenced by this transport phenomenon. The average amino acid incorporation rate thus calculated was 0.7 nmole/ml ﾂｷ min for nontumor tissue with a tumor versus nontumor average ratio of 1.7.

In controls  the basal nucleus contained the highest choline acetyltransferase activity; the activity in the lateral and central nuclei and those in the cortical  medial and accessory basal nuclei were comparable. In AD  there was a significant decrease in choline acetyltransferase activity in the accessory basal and lateral nuclei  in DLB a significant decrease was observed in the accessory basal  lateral and cortical nuclei. Compared to controls the hyperphosphorylated tau-pathology burden was significantly higher in the basal  central and medial nuclei in AD and in the central  cortical  lateral and medial nuclei in DLB. The amyloid plaque burden was significantly higher in the accessory basal  basal  lateral and cortical nuclei in AD and in all nuclei in DLB. The alpha-synuclein burden was significantly higher in all nuclei in both AD and DLB. Compared to AD alpha-synuclein burden was higher in all nuclei in DLB. There were no correlations between the distribution pattern of hyperphosphorylated tau-pathology  amyloid plaques and alpha-synuclein-positive structures  and choline acetyltransferase activity  except the lateral nucleus in DLB. In conclusion we found no relationship between the pattern of cholinergic deficits and the distribution pattern of lesions in the AC of patients with AD or DLB. Cholinergic deficits were more prominent in the nuclei of basolateral (BL) group in AD  whereas the nuclei of both BL and corticomedial groups were involved in DLB  which may be due to the involvement of both basal forebrain and brainstem cholinergic nuclei in the latter.,0,The distribution pattern of pathology and cholinergic deficits in amygdaloid complex in Alzheimer's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies.We studied the distribution pattern of pathology and cholinergic deficits in the subnuclei of the amygdaloid complex (AC) in five patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD)  eight with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and five normal controls.

193,48595,Time course of glucose metabolism in relation to cognitive performance and postmortem neuropathology in Met146Val PSEN1 mutation carriers.,Studies in carriers of mutations that cause early-onset familial Alzheimer窶冱 disease (eoFAD) are of significant interest.We showed previously that regional glucose hypometabolism could be detected many years before disease onset in presenilin 1(PSEN1) mutation carriers. Here we studied four members of a family with a Met146Val PSEN1 mutation  two symptomatic carriers and two non-carriers  longitudinally with 18F-FDG PET over a period of about two and four years  respectively. The two mutation carriers showed global cortical glucose hypometabolism over time with the most distinct decline occurring in the posterior cingulate  the parietal and parietotemporal cortex  which was also observed when compared with a group of 23 healthy controls and a group of 27 sporadic Alzheimer窶冱 disease (sAD) patients. This decline correlated with cognitive deterioration overtime as measured by neuropsychological tests. Postmortem examination of brain tissue revealed substantially elevated levels of AD type neuropathology in terms of neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the two mutation carriers compared with a reference group of 249 sAD patients. In the mutation carriers  the amount of neuritic plaques but not neurofibrillary tangles correlated hereby significantly with regional glucose metabolism as measured by 18F-FDG on the last scanning occasions  which were performed four and approximately five years before death  respectively. We here show that FDG PET can depict in vivo the aggressive disease progression in eoFAD mutation carriers in relationship to neuropathology.,0,Time course of glucose metabolism in relation to cognitive performance and postmortem neuropathology in Met146Val PSEN1 mutation carriers.Studies in carriers of mutations that cause early-onset familial Alzheimer窶冱 disease (eoFAD) are of significant interest.We showed previously that regional glucose hypometabolism could be detected many years before disease onset in presenilin 1(PSEN1) mutation carriers.

[Polish],Background: Ultrasonography and its variation with the application of fluid via nasogastric tube to the stomach plays the key role in the diagnosis of infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (ihps). The aim of the study was to evaluate various means of visualization of hypertrophic pylorus. Materials and methods: Due to ihps  since 1997 through 2006 - 68 infants (63 boys and 5girls) underwent surgery in the Clinic of Paediatric Surgery and Urology  Polish Mother's Health Memorial Hospital in Lodz. Results: In 13 cases the decision to operate was made without any diagnostic imaging. Transabdominal sonographic examination was used in 16 cases  barium meal was used additionally in 4. Two children were examined with the use of both: ultrasound and barium meal. Due to unsatisfactory results since 2000 routine sonographic examination has been implemented with the application of fluid via a nasogastric tube in 33 cases. In this group of patients the mean pyloric length was 19.4 mm  pyloric diameter - 13.2 mm  pyloric muscle thickness - 4.7 mm and pyloric ratio - 0.35.

195,25669,Preparedness and vulnerability of African countries against importations of COVID-19: a modelling study,"BACKGROUND: The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic has spread from China to 25 countries. Local cycles of transmission have already occurred in 12 countries after case importation. In Africa, Egypt has so far confirmed one case. The management and control of COVID-19 importations heavily rely on a country's health capacity. Here we evaluate the preparedness and vulnerability of African countries against their risk of importation of COVID-19. METHODS: We used data on the volume of air travel departing from airports in the infected provinces in China and directed to Africa to estimate the risk of importation per country. We determined the country's capacity to detect and respond to cases with two indicators: preparedness, using the WHO International Health Regulations Monitoring and Evaluation Framework; and vulnerability, using the Infectious Disease Vulnerability Index. Countries were clustered according to the Chinese regions contributing most to their risk. FINDINGS: Countries with the highest importation risk (ie, Egypt, Algeria, and South Africa) have moderate to high capacity to respond to outbreaks. Countries at moderate risk (ie, Nigeria, Ethiopia, Sudan, Angola, Tanzania, Ghana, and Kenya) have variable capacity and high vulnerability. We identified three clusters of countries that share the same exposure to the risk originating from the provinces of Guangdong, Fujian, and the city of Beijing, respectively. INTERPRETATION: Many countries in Africa are stepping up their preparedness to detect and cope with COVID-19 importations. Resources, intensified surveillance, and capacity building should be urgently prioritised in countries with moderate risk that might be ill-prepared to detect imported cases and to limit onward transmission.

196,39061,Could changes in arterioles impede the perivascular drainage of interstitial fluid from the cerebral white matter in leukoaraiosis?,AIMS: Leukoaraiosis (LA) is the increase in fluid in cerebral white matter with hyperintensity on T2-weighted MR imaging that occurs in 25% of individuals over 65 years of age and in Alzheimer's disease. Age  hypertension  diabetes mellitus and cardiac disease are the major risk factors for LA. Ischaemia is considered to be the cause of LA  but the aim of the present study is to assess whether changes in arterioles in LA could impede perivascular lymphatic drainage of interstitial fluid from the cerebral white matter. METHODS: We quantified arteriolosclerosis and immunohistochemical changes in the extracellular matrix in arterioles of cerebral white matter in 20 hypertension autopsy cases with LA and in 10 controls. RESULTS: The ratio of the area immunoreactive for collagen types I  III  V and VI to the cross-sectional area of arterioles was significantly higher in LA patients compared with controls (P < 0.001). Changes were observed in collagen IV and laminin. The walls of white matter arterioles in LA were significantly thicker (P < 0.01)  and lumina were significantly smaller (P < 0.01). Arterioles had a significantly higher sclerotic index [1 - (internal/external diameter)] in LA than in adjacent cortex or control white matter (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that thickening and sclerosis of the walls of arterioles in cerebral white matter in LA are associated with the accumulation of extracellular matrix components. Although these changes may result in decreased perfusion  they could also impede perivascular lymphatic drainage of interstitial fluid from white matter in LA.,0,Could changes in arterioles impede the perivascular drainage of interstitial fluid from the cerebral white matter in leukoaraiosis?AIMS: Leukoaraiosis (LA) is the increase in fluid in cerebral white matter with hyperintensity on T2-weighted MR imaging that occurs in 25% of individuals over 65 years of age and in Alzheimer's disease.

198,10479,Astroglial activation of extracellular-regulated kinase in early stages of Alzheimer disease.,Characterization of the earliest neuropathologic features of Alzheimer disease (AD) indicates that synaptic degeneration accompanied by tau hyperphosphorylation and amyloid deposition might be an important feature. The mechanisms involved are unclear; however  dysregulation of signaling cascades such as the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway might play a role. In this context  the main objective of this study was to determine whether ERK hyperactivation occurs in early stages of AD. We compared the patterns of total and phosphorylated ERK (pERK) expression in the midfrontal cortex of patients clinically and neuropathologically characterized with early  intermediate  or advanced AD. Immunocytochemical and Western blot analysis showed that in early AD  there was extensive activation of ERK in astroglial cells in the white matter accompanied by intense astrogliosis. In contrast  in patients with more advanced AD  pERK immunoreactivity was associated with neuronal cell bodies and dystrophic neurites around plaques. Levels of astroglial pERK immunoreactivity in the white matter were strongly correlated with scores of cognitive performance (Blessed  Mini-Mental Status Examination  and Clinical Dementia Rating) and with the severity of AD neuropathology (Braak stage). These findings suggest that astroglial ERK activation may be an important early response to the onset of AD pathology. Identification of cell signaling events unique to early AD may provide therapeutic targets for the prevention or delay of dementia.,0,Astroglial activation of extracellular-regulated kinase in early stages of Alzheimer disease.Characterization of the earliest neuropathologic features of Alzheimer disease (AD) indicates that synaptic degeneration accompanied by tau hyperphosphorylation and amyloid deposition might be an important feature.

200,59606,Association of plasma amyloid beta with risk of dementia: the prospective Three-City Study.,OBJECTIVE: Several lines of evidence indicate that a decrease in the CSF concentration of amyloid beta(42) (Abeta(42)) is a potential biomarker for incident Alzheimer disease. In contrast  studies on plasma Abeta(1-40) and Abeta(1-42) peptide levels have yielded contradictory results. Here  we explored the links between incident dementia and plasma Abeta(1-40) and Abeta(1-42) peptide concentrations in the prospective  population-based Three-City (3C) Study. We also assessed the association between plasma concentrations of truncated Abeta (Abeta(n-40) and Abeta(n-42)) and the risk of dementia. METHODS: During a subsequent 4-year follow-up period  257 individuals presented incident dementia from 8 414 participants  and a subcohort of 1 185 individuals without dementia was drawn as a control cohort. Plasma levels of Abeta(1-40)  Abeta(1-42)  Abeta(n-40)  and Abeta(n-42) were measured using an xMAP-based assay technology. The association between plasma Abeta peptide levels and the risk of dementia was assessed using Cox proportional hazard models. RESULTS: Of the various Abeta variables analyzed  the Abeta(1-42)/Abeta(1-40) and Abeta(n-42)/Abeta(n-40) ratios presented the strongest association with the risk of dementia: people with a high Abeta(1-42)/Abeta(1-40) or Abeta(n-42)/Abeta(n-40) ratio had a lower risk of developing dementia. These associations were restricted to individuals diagnosed at 2 years of follow-up and the Abeta(n-42)/Abeta(n-40) ratio was mainly associated with the risk of mixed/vascular dementia. CONCLUSION: Plasma Abeta peptide concentrations and Abeta(1-42)/Abeta(1-40) and Abeta(n-42)/Abeta(n-40) ratios may be useful markers to indicate individuals susceptible to short-term risk of dementia.,0,Association of plasma amyloid beta with risk of dementia: the prospective Three-City Study.OBJECTIVE: Several lines of evidence indicate that a decrease in the CSF concentration of amyloid beta(42) (Abeta(42)) is a potential biomarker for incident Alzheimer disease.

202,20161,Assisting cancer management by reducing and avoiding hospital admissions: The Nurse Practitioner's role in the management of malignant pleural effusion,Background: Pleural effusions are a frequent presenting feature or complication of advanced cancer. Therapeutic pleural aspiration is often performed in unplanned settings  rushed and by trainee doctors requiring supervision. This can significantly negate a patient's cancer journey. Methods: Over the last seven years  the respiratory nurse practitioner has developed a pioneering independent role  coordinating and providing patient-centred pleural disease service  including management of malignant pleural effusions  thereby enhancing cancer management in patients suitable for more definitive anti-cancer therapies. Results: The respiratory Nurse Practitioner is informed of patients with a suspected pleural effusion from medical practitioners (inpatients or outpatients)  oncologists and the lung CNS. Diagnostic ultrasound-guided pleural aspiration is performed by the Nurse Practitioner. Respiratory physicians are informed and a review organised where necessary. Patients are managed as outpatients with personalised plans devised and contact details provided for patient-directed contact. Further intermittent therapeutic pleural aspirations (particularly in patients not suitable for more invasive procedures) are performed at times suitable for patients. The frequency is totally dependent on the individual need  and the Nurse Practitioner can be contacted by the GP  lung CNS  oncology nurse patient or their family. Other management options including thoracoscopic pleurodesis  tunnelled indwelling catheter placement and ward-based pleurodesis are discussed and co-ordinated as indicated by the nurse practitioner. Medical records are updated  managing physicians are informed of progress or problems and the patient avoids unnecessary hospital admissions. Over a 32 month period since January 2011  718 episodes of care were undertaken with 308 of these being as outpatients. Pleural aspiration was performed on 367 separate occasions for both diagnostic and therapeutic indications with a total volume drained of 232 330 ml. Conclusion: This unique nurse practitioner directed pleural service is efficient  robust and personalised  enabling maximum preservation of quality of life to complement other aspects of cancer management.,0,Assisting cancer management by reducing and avoiding hospital admissions: The Nurse Practitioner's role in the management of malignant pleural effusionBackground: Pleural effusions are a frequent presenting feature or complication of advanced cancer.

The frequency is totally dependent on the individual need  and the Nurse Practitioner can be contacted by the GP  lung CNS  oncology nurse patient or their family. Other management options including thoracoscopic pleurodesis  tunnelled indwelling catheter placement and ward-based pleurodesis are discussed and co-ordinated as indicated by the nurse practitioner. Medical records are updated  managing physicians are informed of progress or problems and the patient avoids unnecessary hospital admissions. Over a 32 month period since January 2011  718 episodes of care were undertaken with 308 of these being as outpatients. Pleural aspiration was performed on 367 separate occasions for both diagnostic and therapeutic indications with a total volume drained of 232 330 ml. Conclusion: This unique nurse practitioner directed pleural service is efficient  robust and personalised  enabling maximum preservation of quality of life to complement other aspects of cancer management.,"{'judgement': 'True', 'index': 202}",1,"{'judgement': 'False', 'index': 202}",0,"{'judgement': 'False', 'index': 202}",0

This condition is characterized by high levels of D-dimer and fibrinogen, prolonged prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time. METHOD: Blood samples from three COVID-19 patients treated in a Hungarian intensive care unit were collected and analyzed with ClotPro R tests. EX-tests, IN-test, FIB-tests, RVV-tests, and TPA-tests were performed. The results were interpreted with respect to the clinical condition of the patients. RESULTS: Procoagulation, hypercoagulation and either fibrinolysis or a ""shut down"" phenomenon of the fibrinolytic process were found with ClotPro R.

Here we present the high-resolution characterization of the conformational properties of two FTDP-17 mutants of the four-repeat domain of tau  P301L and DeltaK280  and their properties for binding to polyanions and microtubules. Multidimensional NMR spectroscopy shows that the mutations do no lead to a significant increase in the level of beta-structure in their monomeric state  even though the mutations strongly promote beta-structure during aggregation. However  local structural changes are induced in the second repeat. These changes only weakly affect the binding to the polyanion heparin  which promotes paired helical filament formation. The extent of binding to microtubules  however  is strongly decreased. Our results demonstrate that the reversible binding of tau to microtubules involves specific interactions  which are not essential for binding to polyanions.,0,Structural and microtubule binding properties of tau mutants of frontotemporal dementias.Several mutations in the gene encoding the microtubule-associated protein tau are responsible for the formation of neurofibrillary inclusions in frontotemporal dementia with Parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17).

After severe traumatic brain injury (TBI)  progressive structural changes occur in white (WM) and gray matter (GM). In the current study  we assessed the signal-intensity contrast of GM and WM in patients with diffuse TBI in the chronic stage to (1) characterize the regional pattern of WM/GM changes in intensity contrast associated with traumatic axonal injury  (2) evaluate possible associations between this measure and diffusion tensor image (DTI)/fractional anisotropy (FA) for detecting WM damage  and (3) investigate the correlates of both measures with cognitive outcomes. Structural T1 scans were processed with FreeSurfer software to identify the boundary and calculate the WM/GM contrast maps. DTIs were processed with the FMRIB software library to obtain FA maps. The WM/GM contrast in TBI patients showed a pattern of reduction in almost all of the brain  except the visual and motor primary regions. Global FA values obtained from DTI correlated with the intensity contrast of all associative cerebral regions. WM/GM contrast correlated with memory functions  whereas FA global values correlated with tests measuring memory and mental processing speed. In conclusion  tissue-contrast intensity is a very sensitive measure for detecting structural brain damage in chronic  severe and diffuse TBI  but is less sensitive than FA for reflecting neuropsychological sequelae  such as impaired mental processing speed.,0,White matter/gray matter contrast changes in chronic and diffuse traumatic brain injury.Signal-intensity contrast of T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging scans has been associated with tissue integrity and reported as a sign of neurodegenerative changes in diseases such as Alzheimer's disease.

218,47662,Social-economic impact of COVID-19 pandemic on aesthetic centers in Greece,"BACKGROUND: Epidemics are a major cause of health problems in developing countries, preventing the accumulation of human capital and economic growth. On the appearance of the pandemic of the new coronavirus COVID-19 worldwide, this survey was carried out in the 4th week of the occurrence of the cases in Greece. OBJECTIVES: The investigation was aimed at the social and economic impact caused by this COVID-19 pandemic and the state's decision to suspend the operation of businesses and stores in Greece. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred and fifth-eight aesthetic centers from various areas of Greece were participated in this study, and the questionnaires were sent electronically to the business owners. Statistical analyzes were conducted using Google Forms and the questionnaires analyzed through PSPP software. RESULTS: Based on their answers and the statistical analyzes, it was calculated the reduction of the monthly income for the first month of suspension of the operation of their companies. Additionally, social related matters were examined as, how they experience this period, psychologically, financially, what problems they believe that they will face and what changes in their work that could result from the pandemic. DISCUSSION: There is no similar study and experience for aesthetic centers from a viral pandemic in literature.

All rights reserved.",0,"Social-economic impact of COVID-19 pandemic on aesthetic centers in GreeceBACKGROUND: Epidemics are a major cause of health problems in developing countries, preventing the accumulation of human capital and economic growth. On the appearance of the pandemic of the new coronavirus COVID-19 worldwide, this survey was carried out in the 4th week of the occurrence of the cases in Greece. OBJECTIVES: The investigation was aimed at the social and economic impact caused by this COVID-19 pandemic and the state's decision to suspend the operation of businesses and stores in Greece. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred and fifth-eight aesthetic centers from various areas of Greece were participated in this study, and the questionnaires were sent electronically to the business owners. Statistical analyzes were conducted using Google Forms and the questionnaires analyzed through PSPP software. RESULTS: Based on their answers and the statistical analyzes, it was calculated the reduction of the monthly income for the first month of suspension of the operation of their companies. Additionally, social related matters were examined as, how they experience this period, psychologically, financially, what problems they believe that they will face and what changes in their work that could result from the pandemic. DISCUSSION: There is no similar study and experience for aesthetic centers from a viral pandemic in literature. The suspension of operations provoked serious financial problems and significant psychological burden about what ""tomorrow will bring"" with returning to ""normalcy"".

219,9359,Posterior cingulate metabolic changes in frontotemporal lobar degeneration detected by magnetic resonance spectroscopy.,Differences in prognosis and symptomatic treatment have highlighted the importance of the differential diagnosis of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and other dementias  but the variable clinical features make diagnosis difficult. We studied metabolic changes using multivoxel proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) in regions of FTLD  including the posterior cingulate gyrus  which is also the area most affected by Alzheimer's disease (AD) in the early stages. We examined six patients with FTLD  six with presumed AD  and five healthy volunteers using repetition and echo times of 2000 and 135 ms. We analysed peak ratios of choline (Cho)  creatine (Cr)  and N-acetylaspartate (NAA) from frontal and temporoparietal regions  basal ganglia  and posterior cingulate gyrus in both hemispheres. A decreased NAA/Cr ratio was observed in the posterior cingulate gyri in presumed AD (right: 1.56+/-0.44  P =0.011; left: 1.46+/-0.25  P =0.008) and FTD (right: 1.47+/-0.40  P =0.005; left: 1.36+/-0.32  P =0.002). No statistically significant changes in Cho/Cr were identified in the posterior cingulate gyri in presumed AD or FTLD  and no differences were observed in peak ratios in other regions.

220,8197,Malignant pleural mesothelioma caused by environmental exposure to asbestos or erionite in rural Turkey: CT findings in 84 patients.,OBJECTIVE: Malignant pleural mesothelioma in rural Turkey frequently results from environmental exposure to tremolite asbestos or fibrous zeolite (erionite). The aim of this study was to determine the CT features of malignant pleural mesothelioma in patients exposed to asbestos or erionite.  MATERIALS AND METHODS: The CT scans of 84 patients with proved malignant pleural mesothelioma were retrospectively evaluated. Twenty patients (24%) had been exposed to erionite and 64 patients (76%) had been exposed to asbestos. The CT scans were interpreted by seven observers who did not know the clinical or pathologic findings.  RESULTS: CT scans showed either unilateral pleural thickening or pleural nodules/masses in all patients. Pleural nodules were present in 25 patients (30%) and pleural masses in 44 patients (52%). Pleural effusion was found in 61 patients (73%)  mediastinal pleural involvement in 78 (93%)  pleural calcifications in 52 (62%)  involvement of the interlobar fissures in 64 (76%)  and volume contraction in 61 (73%). Reduced size of the hemithorax was significantly correlated with chest wall involvement. On the basis of CT findings  the preassigned staging was changed in 21 patients (25%)  including 44% of the patients with disease that had been classified as stage I. CT findings were not significantly different between the patients exposed to erionite and those exposed to asbestos.  CONCLUSION: The most common CT findings in cases of malignant pleural mesothelioma were unilateral pleural thickening or pleural nodules/masses with or without effusion. CT provided valuable information on the extent of the disease  which was important for staging. Although the CT features are not pathognomonic  they provide valuable clues to the diagnosis in patients who have been exposed to mineral fibers.,0,Malignant pleural mesothelioma caused by environmental exposure to asbestos or erionite in rural Turkey: CT findings in 84 patients.OBJECTIVE: Malignant pleural mesothelioma in rural Turkey frequently results from environmental exposure to tremolite asbestos or fibrous zeolite (erionite).

The treatment of these patients poses unique and significant challenges to health care providers requiring changes in existing protocols. CASE PRESENTATION: A 54-year-old COVID-19 positive patient developed sudden onset left hemiparesis secondary to an acute right middle cerebral artery occlusion (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score = 11). Mechanical thrombectomy (MT) was performed under a new protocol specifically designed to maximize protective measures for the team involved in the care of the patient. Mechanical Thrombectomy was performed successfully under general anesthesia resulting in TICI 3 recanalization. With regards to time metrics, time from door to reperfusion was 60 mins. The 24-h NIHSS score decreased to 2. Patient was discharged after 19 days after improvement of her pulmonary status with modified Rankin Scale = 1. CONCLUSION: Patients infected by COVID-19 can develop LVO that is multifactorial in etiology.

The most common level of involvement is at the lumbar spine  followed by the thoracic  cervical and sacral levels: lesions at the thoracic spine tend to lead more frequently to neurological symptoms. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the current paper is to describe current evidence-based standards of therapy in the management of SD by emphasizing pharmacological therapy and principles and indications for bracing and surgery. METHODS: A PubMed and Google Scholar search using various forms and combinations of the key words: spondylodiscitis  spine  infection  therapy  surgery  radiology  treatment. Reference citations from publications identified in the literature search were reviewed. Publications highlighted in this article were extracted based on relevancy to established  putative  and emerging diagnostic and therapeutic standards  either conservative (antibiotic therapy and bracing) or surgical. FINDINGS: To date  conservative therapy  based on targeted antibiotic therapy plus bracing  represents the mainstay in the management of SD. Proper diagnosis and tailored therapy can improve clinical results and decrease the chance of failure. Surgery should be an option only for patients with complications of this disease  namely deformity  neural compression and neurological compromise.

227,10765,Has COVID-19 halted winter-spring wildfires in the Mediterranean? Insights for wildfire science under a pandemic context,"Wildfires in the Mediterranean are strongly tied to human activities. Given their particular link with humans, which act as both initiators and suppressors, wildfire hazard is highly sensitive to socioeconomic changes and patterns. Many researchers have prompted the perils of sustaining the current management policy, the so-called 'total fire exclusion'. This policy, coupled to increasingly fire-prone weather conditions, may lead to more hazardous fires in the mid-long run. Under this framework, the irruption of the COVID-19 pandemic adds to the ongoing situation. Facing the lack of an effective treatment, the only alternative was the implementation of strict lockdown strategies. The virtual halt of the system undoubtedly affected economic and social behavior, triggering cascading effects such as the drop in winter-spring wildfire activity. In this work, we discuss the main impacts, challenges and consequences that wildfire science may experience due to the pandemic situation, and identify potential opportunities for wildfire management. We investigate the recent evolution of burned area (retrieved from the MCD64A1 v006 MODIS product) in the EU Mediterranean region (Portugal, Spain, France, Italy and Greece) to ascertain to what extent the 2020 winter-spring season was impacted by the public health response to COVID-19 (curfews and lockdowns). We accounted for weather conditions (characterized using the 6-month Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index; SPEI6) to disregard possible weather effects mediating fire activity. Our results suggest that, under similar drought-related circumstances (SPEI6 = -0.7), the expected burned area in 2020 during the lockdown period in the EU (March-May) would lay somewhere within the range of 38,800 ha +/- 18,379 ha.

We report the fundamental pathological investigation in the lungs and other organs of fatal cases for the mechanistic understanding of severe COVID-19 and the development of specific therapy in these cases. METHODS: The autopsy and pathological investigations of specimens were performed on bodies of two deceased cases with COVID-19. Gross anatomy and histological investigation by Hematoxylin and eosin (HE) stained were reviewed on each patient. Alcian blue/periodic acid-Schiff (AB-PAS) staining and Masson staining were performed for the examinations of mucus, fibrin and collagen fiber in lung tissues. Immunohistochemical staining were performed on the slides of lung tissues from two patients. Real-time PCR was performed to detect the infection of SARS-CoV-2. Flow cytometry analyses were performed to detect the direct binding of S protein and the expression of ACE2 on the cell surface of macrophages. FINDINGS: The main pathological features in lungs included extensive impairment of type I alveolar epithelial cells and atypical hyperplasia of type II alveolar cells, with formation of hyaline membrane, focal hemorrhage, exudation and pulmonary edema, and pulmonary consolidation. The mucous plug with fibrinous exudate in the alveoli and the dysfunction of alveolar macrophages were characteristic abnormalities. The type II alveolar epithelial cells and macrophages in alveoli and pulmonary hilum lymphoid tissue were infected by SARS-CoV-2. S protein of SARS-CoV-2 directly bound to the macrophage via the S-protein-ACE2 interaction. INTERPRETATION: Infection of Alveolar macrophage by SARS-CoV-2 might be drivers of the ""cytokine storm"", which might result in damages in pulmonary tissues, heart and lung, and leading to the failure of multiple organs .

Alcian blue/periodic acid-Schiff (AB-PAS) staining and Masson staining were performed for the examinations of mucus, fibrin and collagen fiber in lung tissues. Immunohistochemical staining were performed on the slides of lung tissues from two patients. Real-time PCR was performed to detect the infection of SARS-CoV-2. Flow cytometry analyses were performed to detect the direct binding of S protein and the expression of ACE2 on the cell surface of macrophages. FINDINGS: The main pathological features in lungs included extensive impairment of type I alveolar epithelial cells and atypical hyperplasia of type II alveolar cells, with formation of hyaline membrane, focal hemorrhage, exudation and pulmonary edema, and pulmonary consolidation. The mucous plug with fibrinous exudate in the alveoli and the dysfunction of alveolar macrophages were characteristic abnormalities. The type II alveolar epithelial cells and macrophages in alveoli and pulmonary hilum lymphoid tissue were infected by SARS-CoV-2. S protein of SARS-CoV-2 directly bound to the macrophage via the S-protein-ACE2 interaction. INTERPRETATION: Infection of Alveolar macrophage by SARS-CoV-2 might be drivers of the ""cytokine storm"", which might result in damages in pulmonary tissues, heart and lung, and leading to the failure of multiple organs .

231,5973,Influence of anti-osteoporosis treatments on the incidence of COVID-19 in patients with non-inflammatory rheumatic conditions,"Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is currently a global pandemic that affects patients with other pathologies. Here, we investigated the influence of treatments for osteoporosis and other non-inflammatory rheumatic conditions, such as osteoarthritis and fibromyalgia, on COVID-19 incidence. To this end, we conducted a cross-sectional study of 2,102 patients being treated at the Rheumatology Service of Hospital del Mar (Barcelona, Spain). In our cohort, COVID-19 cumulative incidence from March 1 to May 3, 2020 was compared to population estimates for the same city. We used Poisson regression models to determine the adjusted relative risk ratios for COVID-19 associated with different treatments and comorbidities. Denosumab, zoledronate and calcium were negatively associated with COVID-19 incidence. Some analgesics, particularly pregabalin and most of the studied antidepressants, were positively associated with COVID-19 incidence, whereas duloxetine presented a negative association. Oral bisphosphonates, vitamin D, thiazide diuretics, anti-hypertensive drugs and chronic non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs had no effect on COVID-19 incidence in the studied population. Our results provide novel evidence to support the maintenance of the main anti-osteoporosis treatments in COVID-19 patients, which may be of particular relevance to elderly patients affected by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.",0,"Influence of anti-osteoporosis treatments on the incidence of COVID-19 in patients with non-inflammatory rheumatic conditionsCoronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is currently a global pandemic that affects patients with other pathologies.

232,32068,Correlation of the expression level of C1q mRNA and the number of C1q-positive plaques in the Alzheimer Disease temporal cortex. analysis of C1q mrna and its protein using adjacent or nearby sections.,We compared the expression level of C1q mRNA and the number of C1q-positive plaques in adjacent or nearby brain sections from Alzheimer disease (AD) and control cases. Small blocks of temporal cortex were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 2 days at 4 degrees C. After cryoprotection with solutions containing 10-20% glycerol and 2% dimethylsulfoxide  40-microm sections were cut from the tissue blocks. A section from each case was stained by immunohistochemistry using a C1q antibody  while RNA was purified from adjacent or nearby sections using a combination of proteinase K pretreatment followed by extraction using Trizol reagent. The expression of C1q B chain mRNA was analyzed in these samples by the reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The intensities of the PCR products were measured by an image analyzer. The expression of C1q B chain mRNA was significantly more abundant in AD than in control cases (p < 0.05). Immunohistochemical analysis showed that C1q protein was localized in senile plaques in the AD brain. The number of C1q-positive plaques correlated with the expression level of C1q gene (p < 0.05). The present results suggest that C1q protein in senile plaques originates is endogenously produced in the AD brain.,0,Correlation of the expression level of C1q mRNA and the number of C1q-positive plaques in the Alzheimer Disease temporal cortex. analysis of C1q mrna and its protein using adjacent or nearby sections.We compared the expression level of C1q mRNA and the number of C1q-positive plaques in adjacent or nearby brain sections from Alzheimer disease (AD) and control cases.

233,47058,Nitration and oligomerization of tau induced by peroxynitrite inhibit its microtubule-binding activity.,Abnormally nitrated tau has been found recently in the neurofibrillary tangles of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However  whether and how nitration of tau is involved in AD pathology is not known. Herein  we found that in vitro incubation of peroxynitrite with recombinant tau resulted in nitration and oligomerization of tau in a dosage-dependent manner. Moreover  the nitrated tau showed a significantly decreased binding activity to taxol-stabilized microtubulesin in vitro. Further study demonstrated that peroxynitrite also induced tau nitration in neuroblastoma N2a cell line  and the nitrated tau was accumulated in the cells. We conclude that abnormal nitration of tau contributes to the impaired biological activity of tau in binding to the microtubules and the aggregation of tau  implying a novel mechanism responsible for the neurodegeneration seen in AD brain.,0,Nitration and oligomerization of tau induced by peroxynitrite inhibit its microtubule-binding activity.Abnormally nitrated tau has been found recently in the neurofibrillary tangles of Alzheimer's disease (AD).

234,54652,Final analysis of pilot trial of diaphragm pacing (DP) in ALS/MND with long term follow-up: No safety concerns and DP positively affects diaphragm respiration.,Background: Respiratory insufficiency is the major cause of mortality in patients with ALS. Ventilators  although life-saving  are only used by a very small percentage of patients. Alternate therapy to prevent or manage respiratory muscle decline in ALS is needed. The motor point diaphragm pacing (DP) pilot trial formed the basis for the multi-center pivotal trial. This reports the final outcome for the initial patients implanted. Objective: Analyze safety  utility and long term use of the DP system from the initial prospective pilot FDA single site study. Methods: Patients underwent outpatient laparoscopic diaphragm motor point mapping with electrode implantations. Stimulus/output characteristics of each electrode were determined and diaphragm conditioning initiated. Patients conditioned their diaphragms with 5 daily stimulation sessions of 30 minutes each but were allowed to increase usage. Each patient had three extensive lead-in assessments that were continued post implantation of the DPS system and included pulmonary function tests  fluoroscopic evaluation of diaphragm movement  ultrasound analysis of diaphragm thickness  and quality of life tests. Results : From 3/05 to 3/07  16 patients were implanted with no peri-operative or unanticipated device related adverse events. Seven had feeding tubes placements with or after DP. Average age was 50 (range 32-70) with 13 males. Patients were a median 35 months from symptoms at enrolment with a mean ALSFRr of 27 and FVC of 60% predicted at surgery. No patients stopped DP use because of pain  discomfort or failure of implanted electrodes. Four patients are still surviving with 3 on tracheostomy mechanical ventilation. There have been a total of 352 implant-months of follow-up with an average of 22 months per patient post implant. One patient was excluded due to an abdominal co-morbidity of colon cancer diagnosed post implant. Median tracheostomy-free survival was 18.6 months from DP implant  43.4 months from diagnosis and 56 months from initial onset. In all patients  fluoroscopically observed diaphragm excursion was greater with diaphragm stimulation than under maximal voluntary effort. DP significantly increased muscle thickness when assessed with ultrasound (P-value 0.02). Paired FVC rate of decline (treatment - lead in) improved with DP 1.47+/-2.18% per month (P = 0.03). NIV was never used by 7 of the 16 patients and 50% of patients used DP to overcome central sleep apnea. The cause of death or tracheostomy mechanical ventilation include respiratory failure(5 or 33% of all events)  traumatic fall (1) aspiration (3)  peri-operatively from a cervical spinal fixation (1)  urosepsis (1)  colon cancer (1) and three patients had to turn off DP to allow death during final hospice care.

The aim of this study was to assess the inter-rater variability in the interpretation of (18)F-FDG-PET images obtained in the Japanese Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative  a multicenter clinical research project. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study analyzed 274 (18)F-FDG-PET scans (67 mild Alzheimer disease  100 mild cognitive impairment  and 107 normal cognitive) as baseline scans for the Japanese Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative  which were acquired with various types of PET or PET/CT scanners in 23 facilities. Three independent raters interpreted all PET images by using a combined visual-statistical method. The images were classified into 7 (FDG-7) patterns by the criteria of Silverman et al and further into 2 (FDG-2) patterns. RESULTS: Agreement among the 7 visual-statistical categories by at least 2 of the 3 readers occurred in >94% of cases for all groups: Alzheimer disease  mild cognitive impairment  and normal cognitive. Perfect matches by all 3 raters were observed for 62% of the cases by FDG-7 and 76 by FDG-2. Inter-rater concordance was moderate by FDG-7 (ﾎｺ = 0.57) and substantial in FDG-2 (ﾎｺ = 0.67) on average. The FDG-PET score  an automated quantitative index developed by Herholz et al  increased as the number of raters who voted for the AD pattern increased (ﾏ = 0.59  P < .0001)  and the FDG-PET score decreased as those for normal pattern increased (ﾏ = -0.64  P < .0001).

239,36601,Evidence of Abeta- and transgene-dependent defects in ERK-CREB signaling in Alzheimer's models.,Extracellular-signal regulated kinase (ERK) signaling is critical for memory and tightly regulated by acute environmental stimuli. In Alzheimer disease transgenic models  active ERK is shown to first be increased  then later reduced  but whether these baseline changes reflect disruptions in ERK signaling is less clear. We investigated the influence of the familial Alzheimer's disease transgene APPsw and beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) immunoneutralization on cannulation injury-associated (i.c.v. infusion) ERK activation. At both 12 and 22 months of age  the trauma-associated activation of ERK observed in Tg(-) mice was dramatically attenuated in Tg(+). In cortices of 22-month-old non-infused mice  a reduction in ERK activation was observed in Tg(+)  relative to Tg(-) mice. Intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) anti-Abeta infusion significantly increased phosphorylated ERK  its substrate cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) and a downstream target  the NMDA receptor subunit. We also demonstrated that Abeta oligomer decreased active ERK and subsequently active CREB in human neuroblastoma cells  which could be prevented by oligomer immunoneutralization. Abeta oligomers also inhibited active ERK and CREB in primary neurons  in addition to reducing the downstream post-synaptic protein NMDA receptor subunit. These effects were reversed by anti-oligomer. Our data strongly support the existence of an APPsw transgene-dependent and Abeta oligomer-mediated defect in regulation of ERK activation.,0,Evidence of Abeta- and transgene-dependent defects in ERK-CREB signaling in Alzheimer's models.Extracellular-signal regulated kinase (ERK) signaling is critical for memory and tightly regulated by acute environmental stimuli.

240,56008,Nuclear medicine methods for evaluation of skeletal infection among other diagnostic modalities,Skeletal infection continues to be a common and difficult condition in clinical practice and early accurate diagnosis is very challenging. Clinical and laboratory features of skeletal infections are not always present  may be confusing  and are nonspecific for bone infection in its early stages  therefore  several imaging modalities are used for early detection of osteomyelitis. Plain films should always be the first step in the imaging assessment of osteomyelitis  however  the sensitivity for X-ray radiography has been reported to range from 43% to 75%  and the specificity from 75% to 83%. Over years  scintigraphic procedures have become an essential part of the diagnostic procedure for osteomyelitis. The standard approach for bone scintigraphy with tech 99mTc labeled methylene diphosphonate to assess for osteomyelitis is to perform a three-phase procedure. The positive uptake on all three phases is highly sensitive for osteomyelitis (sensitivity 73% to 100%). 67Ga citrate gained more attention for the more specific diagnosis of osteomyelitis due to its known capacity to localize in cases of active infection and pus. The reported specificity for 67Ga scintigraphy in osteomyelitis is around 67-70% and the specificity is much higher (92%) when 67Ga single photon emission tomography was obtained. Labeled white blood cell (WBC) imaging has become the procedure of choice to diagnose most cases of skeletal infections except for those of the spine. Labeling of leucocytes can be done either by 111In or 99mTc labeled hexamethylpropylene amineoxime. The sensitivity and specificity for labeled WBCs are in the high range of 80% to 90%. [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET) has been found to accumulate non-specifically at sites of infection and inflammation. Investigational studies showed that PET is particularly valuable in the evaluation of chronic osteomyelitis and infected prostheses. Other imaging modalities include sonography  computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The sensitivity and specificity of CT for the diagnosis of osteomyelitis has not been established clearly and are in the range of 65% to 75%. The sensitivity of MRI for osteomyelitis has been generally reported as being between 82% and 100%  and specificity between 75% and 96%. Cases of osteomyelitis commonly referred to diagnostic imaging departments include chronic osteomyelitis  diabetic foot infections  vertebral osteomyelitis  joint prostheses and patients with suspected reinfection. These specific entities need special attention and careful selection of the correct tracer or combination of imaging modalities that is best suited for the proper therapeutic management protocols.,0,Nuclear medicine methods for evaluation of skeletal infection among other diagnostic modalitiesSkeletal infection continues to be a common and difficult condition in clinical practice and early accurate diagnosis is very challenging.

242,4456,Interactive effect of apolipoprotein e genotype and age on hippocampal activation during memory processing in healthy adults.,CONTEXT: Although the apolipoprotein E (APOE) ﾏｵ4 allele is a major genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer disease  its effect on hippocampal function during episodic memory is controversial because studies have yielded mixed results. The age of the studied cohorts may contribute to this apparent inconsistency: activation for ﾏｵ4 carriers tends to be increased in studies of older adults but decreased in some studies of younger adults. Consistent with differential age effects  research in transgenic mice suggests that the ﾏｵ4 allele may particularly affect the aging process. OBJECTIVE: To define the interactions of age and this allelic variation on brain activation during episodic memory across adult life in healthy individuals. DESIGN: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) using an episodic memory paradigm to test for differences in neuroactivation across APOE genotypes and age groups. SETTING: A federal research institute. PARTICIPANTS: Healthy white volunteers (APOE ﾏｵ3 homozygotes and ﾏｵ2 and ﾏｵ4 heterozygotes) completed the fMRI task (133 volunteers aged 19-77 years). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Memory-related regional blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) activation. RESULTS: Genotype affected the pattern of change in hippocampal BOLD activation across the adult lifespan: older age was associated with decreased activation in ﾏｵ2 carriers and  to a lesser extent  in ﾏｵ3 homozygotes  but this pattern was not observed in ﾏｵ4 carriers. Among young participants  ﾏｵ4 carriers had less hippocampal activation compared with ﾏｵ3 homozygotes despite similar task performance. CONCLUSIONS: The findings support the hypothesis that aging and APOE allele status have interacting effects on the neural substrate of episodic memory and lend clarification to disparities in the literature. The stepwise decrease in activation with age found among genotype groups resembles the order of susceptibility to Alzheimer disease  suggesting a compensatory neurobiological mechanism in older asymptomatic ﾏｵ4 carriers.,0,Interactive effect of apolipoprotein e genotype and age on hippocampal activation during memory processing in healthy adults.CONTEXT: Although the apolipoprotein E (APOE) ﾏｵ4 allele is a major genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer disease  its effect on hippocampal function during episodic memory is controversial because studies have yielded mixed results.

The functional consequences of this upregulation are unclear. To identify molecular pathways coupled to IF regulation in reactive astrocytes  and to study the interaction with microglia  we examined WT and APPswe/PS1dE9 (AD) mice lacking either GFAP  or both VIM and GFAP  and determined the transcriptome of cortical astrocytes and microglia from 15- to 18-month-old mice. Genes involved in lysosomal degradation (including several cathepsins) and in inflammatory response (including Cxcl5  Tlr6  Tnf  Il1b) exhibited a higher AD-induced increase when GFAP  or VIM and GFAP  were absent. The expression of Aqp4 and Gja1 displayed the same pattern. The downregulation of neuronal support genes in astrocytes from AD mice was absent in GFAP/VIM null mice. In contrast  the absence of IFs did not affect the transcriptional alterations induced by AD in microglia  nor was the cortical plaque load altered. Visualizing astrocyte morphology in GFAP-eGFP mice showed no clear structural differences in GFAP/VIM null mice  but did show diminished interaction of astrocyte processes with plaques. Microglial proliferation increased similarly in all AD groups. In conclusion  absence of GFAP  or both GFAP and VIM  alters AD-induced changes in gene expression profile of astrocytes  showing a compensation of the decrease of neuronal support genes and a trend for a slightly higher inflammatory expression profile.

MEDLINE  Cochrane Library  and EMBASE database were searched for articles that evaluated the value of FDG-PET in LVV  from January 2000 to December 2013. Inclusion criteria were American College of Rheumatology criteria for GCA or TA  definition PET positivity threshold  and >4 cases included. Sensitivity (Se) and specificity (Sp) of FDG-PET for the diagnosis of large-vessel inflammation were calculated from each included individual study  and then pooled for meta-analysis with a random-effects model. Twenty-one studies (413 patients  299 controls) were included in the systematic review. FDG-PET showed FDG vascular uptake in 70% (288/413) of patients and 7% (22/299) of controls. Only vascular uptake equal to or higher than the liver uptake was significantly different between GCA/TA patients and controls (P < 0.001). The meta-analysis of GCA patients (4 studies  57 patients) shows that FDG-PET has high Se and Sp for the diagnosis of large-vessel inflammation in GCA patients in comparison to controls  with a pooled Se at 90% (95% confidence interval [CI]  79%-93%) and a pooled Sp at 98% (95% CI  94%-99%). The meta-analysis of TA patients (7 studies  191 patients) shows that FDG-PET has a pooled Se at 87% (95% CI  78%-93%) and Sp at 73% (95% CI  63%-81%) for the assessment of disease activity in TA  with up to 84% Sp  with studies using National Institutes of Health criteria as the disease activity assessment scale.

247,17392,Low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 promotes anti-apoptotic signaling in neurons by activating Akt survival pathway.,The low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) is a multi-ligand receptor abundantly expressed in neurons. Previous work has shown that brain LRP1 levels are decreased during aging and in Alzheimer disease. Although mounting evidence has demonstrated a role for LRP1 in the metabolism of apolipoprotein E/lipoprotein and amyloid-beta peptide  whether LRP1 also plays a direct role in neuronal survival is not clear. Here  we show that LRP1 expression is critical for the survival of primary neurons under stress conditions including trophic withdrawal  the presence of apoptosis inducers  or amyloid-beta-induced neurotoxicity. Using lentiviral short hairpin RNA to knock down endogenous LRP1 expression  we showed that a depletion of LRP1 leads to an activation of caspase-3 and increased neuronal apoptosis  an effect that was rescued by a caspase-3 inhibitor. A correlation between decreased Akt phosphorylation and the activation of caspase-3 was demonstrated in LRP1 knocked down neurons. Notably  LRP1 knockdown decreased insulin receptor levels in primary neurons  suggesting that decreased neuronal survival might be a consequence of an impaired insulin receptor signaling pathway. Correspondingly  both insulin receptor and phospho-Akt levels were decreased in LRP1 forebrain knock-out mice. These results demonstrate that LRP1 mediates anti-apoptotic function in neurons by regulating insulin receptor and the Akt survival pathway and suggest that restoring LRP1 expression in Alzheimer disease brain might be beneficial to inhibiting neurodegeneration.,0,Low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 promotes anti-apoptotic signaling in neurons by activating Akt survival pathway.The low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) is a multi-ligand receptor abundantly expressed in neurons.

We have developed an immunocapture assay to measure the specific enzyme activity of neprilysin in brain tissue homogenates and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).

This fluorogenic substrate is ordinarily cleaved by multiple enzymes. We have shown that without the immunocapture phase  even under reaction conditions reported to be specific for neprilysin - i.e. in the presence of thiorphan  at pH above 7 - the fluorogenic peptide substrate does not allow neprilysin activity in brain homogenates and CSF to be discriminated from that of other closely related enzymes.

254,18995,Semantic processing in the anterior temporal lobes: a meta-analysis of the functional neuroimaging literature.,The role of the anterior temporal lobes (ATLs) in semantic cognition is not clear from the current literature. Semantic dementia patients show a progressive and a specific semantic impairment  following bilateral atrophy of the ATLs. Neuroimaging studies of healthy participants  however  do not consistently show ATL activation during semantic tasks. Consequently  several influential theories of semantic memory do not ascribe a central role to the ATLs. We conducted a meta-analysis of 164 functional neuroimaging studies of semantic processing to investigate factors that might contribute to the inconsistency in previous results. Four factors influenced the likelihood of finding ATL activation: (1) the use of PET versus fMRI  reflecting the fact that fMRI but not PET is sensitive to distortion artifacts caused by large variations in magnetic susceptibility in the area of the ATL; (2) a field of view (FOV) of more than 15 cm  thereby ensuring whole-brain coverage; (3) the use of a high baseline task to prevent subtraction of otherwise uncontrolled semantic activation; (4) the inclusion of the ATL as an ROI. The type of stimuli or task did not influence the likelihood of ATL activation  consistent with the view that this region underpins an amodal semantic system. Spoken words  written words  and picture stimuli produced overlapping ATL peaks. On average  these were more inferior for picture-based tasks. We suggest that the specific pattern of ATL activation may be influenced by stimulus type due to variations across this region in the degree of connectivity with modality-specific areas in posterior temporal cortex.,0,Semantic processing in the anterior temporal lobes: a meta-analysis of the functional neuroimaging literature.The role of the anterior temporal lobes (ATLs) in semantic cognition is not clear from the current literature. Semantic dementia patients show a progressive and a specific semantic impairment  following bilateral atrophy of the ATLs. Neuroimaging studies of healthy participants  however  do not consistently show ATL activation during semantic tasks. Consequently  several influential theories of semantic memory do not ascribe a central role to the ATLs. We conducted a meta-analysis of 164 functional neuroimaging studies of semantic processing to investigate factors that might contribute to the inconsistency in previous results.

Previous studies found an association of DS with -48C/T presenilin-1 and with the -850 tumor necrosis factor-alpha  two polymorphisms of genes involved in amyloid beta modulation In this study  we evaluated whether the insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE)  a protease involved in the degradation of endogenous brain-derived Abeta peptides  is involved in DS-related AD. To this end  287 DS patients were compared with 251 apparently healthy controls  in order to assess the association between DS and two single nucleotide polymorphisms located on the introns 14 and 24 of the IDE gene. The comparison of allele and genotype distribution between cases and controls showed no evidence for an association with regard to IDE polymorphism  for both the SNPs (i.e.  IDE 185 and IDE 199). In conclusion  the findings of our study suggest that the two IDE polymorphisms considered in the analysis do not appear to play a major role in DS-related AD.,0,Lack of association between IDE genetic variability and Down's syndrome.Virtually all patients with Down's syndrome develop Alzheimer disease (AD) during their life; thus  it is extremely important to investigate potential determinants of AD in this population.

This analysis was aimed at tracing a trend related to death counts expected at the 5th and 6th week of the COVID-19 in India. Material(s) and Method(s): Validated database was used to procure global and Indian data related to coronavirus and related outcomes. Multiple regression and linear regression analyses were used interchangeably. Since the week 6 death count data was not correlated significantly with any of the chosen inputs, an auto-regression technique was employed to improve the predictive ability of the regression model. Result(s): A linear regression analysis predicted average week 5 death count to be 211 with a 95% CI: 1.31-2.60). Similarly, week 6 death count, in spite of a strong correlation with input variables, did not pass the test of statistical significance. Using auto-regression technique and using week 5 death count as input the linear regression model predicted week 6 death count in India to be 467, while keeping at the back of our mind the risk of over-estimation by most of the risk-based models. Conclusion(s): According to our analysis, if situation continue in present state; projected death rate (n) is 211 and467 at the end of the 5th and 6th week from now, respectively.Copyright Â© 2020 Diabetes India",0,"Prediction of the number of deaths in India due to SARS-CoV-2 at 5-6 weeksIntroduction: and Aims: No valid treatment or preventative strategy has evolved till date to counter the SARS CoV 2 (Novel Coronavirus) epidemic that originated in China in late 2019 and have since wrought havoc on millions across the world with illness, socioeconomic recession and death.

260,54080,CT scans for prostate cancer staging-prevalence of incidentalomas and the effect on management,Introduction & Objectives: CT scans are unreliable for staging prostate cancer and are not generally recommended by the American Urology Association or European Urology Association. This study examines CT images of the abdomen/ pelvis + / - chest for staging prostate cancer in a patient population who would be eligible for definitive therapy or active surveillance. CT reports were reviewed by clinical staff to determine if 'incidental' findings may affect care. Methods: SA-PCCOC is the largest prostate cancer database in the southern hemisphere. From the database we selected cases aged < 70 years  with Gleason scores ≥ 6  and PSA < 20. CT scan for staging was defined as within 6 months of diagnosis. Due to access to reports  only CT scans performed in public facilities were reviewed. Two clinical authors (blinded) assessed images with regards to findings which may affect timing or type of treatment. A kappa statistic was used to test inter-observer correlation. Results: 1977 public hospital  consented patients met criteria. 642 had CT scans following diagnosis. An unknown number of scans conducted in private facilities may be missing making prevalence of CT scans hard to assess. 293 patients had CT scans at public facilities. 40 participants were excluded from analysis as scan reports were unavailable. The prevalence adjusted Kappa of inter-rater agreement was 0.91 (95% CI0.84-0.95). A Kappa value > 0.8 indicates almost perfect agreement. A selection of 'incidentalomas detected': • Renal Mass (3) • Suspicious Porta Hepatis/Para-aortic/ Iliac Nodes/Liver lesion (9) • Possible Lung Cancer/Malignant pleural effusion/Bowel lymphoma (5) • Gall bladder mass (1) • Urachal cyst (1) • Aortic/Iliac/Splenic Aneurysms (3) • Aortic Dissection (1) • IVC or Left ventricular thrombus (2) C onclusions: It is an individual clinical decision if 'incidental' findings on CT staging will alter care and if these may be detected by other staging  e.g. Whole Body Bone Scan or prostate MRI. Given the pathology found and the good correlation between reviewers  it is likely that management may be altered in a small proportion (∼ 5-10%) of cases. Radical prostatectomy and radiotherapy provide significant survival benefit with longer follow up although the side effects of treatment are significant. It may be worth considering CT imaging as a tool to assess patient comorbidity rather than a tool to help stage prostate cancer. The economic impact of CT scans for this purpose remains to be assessed.

The clinical information in caring of critically ill patients with COVID-19 needs to be shared timely, especially under the situations that there is still a largely ongoing spread of COVID-19 in many countries. METHODS: A multicenter prospective observational study investigated all the COVID-19 patients received in 19 ICUs of 16 hospitals in Wuhan, China, over 24 h between 8 AM February 2h and 8 AM February 27, 2020. The demographic information, clinical characteristics, vital signs, complications, laboratory values, and clinical managements of the patients were studied. RESULTS: A total of 226 patients were included. Their median (interquartile range, IQR) age was 64 (57-70) years, and 139 (61.5%) patients were male. The duration from the date of ICU admission to the study date was 11 (5-17) days, and the duration from onset of symptoms to the study date was 31 (24-36) days. Among all the patients, 155 (68.6%) had at least one coexisting disease, and their sequential organ failure assessment score was 4 (2-8).

264,31447,What does fluorodeoxyglucose PET imaging add to a clinical diagnosis of dementia?,BACKGROUND: Few studies have compared the accuracy of [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET to the accuracy of clinical and pathologic diagnosis in dementia patients. METHODS: Forty-four individuals with dementia  cognitive impairment  or normal cognitive function underwent clinical initial evaluation (IE) and PET scanning and were followed up for approximately 4 years until a final evaluation (FE) and 5 years until death and autopsy. Clinical  pathologic  and imaging diagnoses were categorized as Alzheimer disease (AD) or not AD. RESULTS: Sensitivity of the IE for the pathologic diagnosis of AD was 0.76  and specificity was 0.58; PET had values of 0.84 and 0.74  and FE had values of 0.88 and 0.63. Positive predictive values for IE  PET  and FE were 0.70  0.81  and 0.76. Negative predictive values were 0.65  0.78  and 0.80. The diagnosis of AD was associated with a 70% probability of detecting AD pathology; with a positive PET scan this increased to 84%  and with a negative PET scan this decreased to 31%. A diagnosis of not AD at IE was associated with a 35% probability of AD pathology  increasing to 70% with a positive PET scan. CONCLUSIONS: As a diagnostic tool  PET is superior to a baseline clinical evaluation and similar to an evaluation performed 4 years later. Although the addition of [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose PET to a clinical diagnosis provides useful information that can affect the likelihood of detecting Alzheimer disease pathology  the value of this technique in the current clinical environment with limited therapeutic options is likely to be modest.,0,What does fluorodeoxyglucose PET imaging add to a clinical diagnosis of dementia?BACKGROUND: Few studies have compared the accuracy of [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET to the accuracy of clinical and pathologic diagnosis in dementia patients. METHODS: Forty-four individuals with dementia  cognitive impairment  or normal cognitive function underwent clinical initial evaluation (IE) and PET scanning and were followed up for approximately 4 years until a final evaluation (FE) and 5 years until death and autopsy. Clinical  pathologic  and imaging diagnoses were categorized as Alzheimer disease (AD) or not AD. RESULTS: Sensitivity of the IE for the pathologic diagnosis of AD was 0.76  and specificity was 0.58; PET had values of 0.84 and 0.74  and FE had values of 0.88 and 0.63. Positive predictive values for IE  PET  and FE were 0.70  0.81  and 0.76. Negative predictive values were 0.65  0.78  and 0.80.

There were fears that health services would not be able to care for high numbers of COVID-19 patients. AIM To describe and review the emergency response of a public primary and community health-care organisation in Stockholm, Sweden, to the demand for care for COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients during March-July 2020, and summarise preparations for the months to follow. METHODS This was a rapid implementation action research case study, which also draws on one author's experience as Chief Executive Officer and other members' experience in an emergency management group. RESULTS Sweden experienced similar mortality per million population to the UK, despite the different public health strategy used to address the COVID-19 outbreak. The Stockholm-integrated public primary and community health-care service, serving a population of 2.3 million, made many changes quickly. One change included coordinating non-acute private health-care services, following the local government emergency directive to do so. DISCUSSION It is possible that the fast and effective response by management and services in primary and community health care reduced infection and hospital demand, which contributed to a lower mortality than otherwise expected. The actions and preparations described for Stockholm's response may provide ideas for other health-care systems.

This study aimed to describe the clinical features of COVID-19 in rheumatic patients and provide information for handling this situation in clinical practice. METHOD(S): This is a retrospective case series study. Deidentified data, including gender, age, laboratory and radiological results, symptoms, signs, and medication history, were collected from 2326 patients diagnosed with COVID-19, including 21 cases in combination with rheumatic disease, in Tongji Hospital between 13 January and 15 March 2020. RESULT(S): Length of hospital stay and mortality rate were similar between rheumatic and non-rheumatic groups, while the presence of respiratory failure was more common in rheumatic cases (38% vs 10%, p<0.001). Symptoms of fever, fatigue and diarrhoea were seen in 76%, 43% and 23% of patients, respectively. There were four rheumatic patients who experienced a flare of rheumatic disease during hospital stay, with symptoms of muscle aches, back pain, joint pain or rash. While lymphocytopaenia was seen in 57% of rheumatic patients, only one patient (5%) presented with leucopenia in rheumatic cases.

We developed both a dedicated airway team and coordinated education programme to facilitate ward management of tracheostomised COVID-19 patients. Here, we report outcomes in the first 100 COVID-19 patients who underwent tracheostomy at our institution. METHODS: This was a prospective observational cohort study of patients confirmed to have COVID-19 who required mechanical ventilation at Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham, UK. The primary outcome measure was 30-day survival, accounting for severe organ dysfunction (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health [APACHE]-II score>17). Secondary outcomes included duration of ventilation, ICU stay, and healthcare workers directly involved in tracheostomy care acquiring COVID-19. RESULTS: A total of 164 patients with COVID-19 were admitted to the ICU between March 9, 2020 and April 21, 2020. A total of 100 patients (mean [standard deviation] age: 55 [12] yr; 29% female) underwent tracheostomy; 64 (age: 57 [14] yr; 25% female) did not undergo tracheostomy. Despite similar APACHE-II scores, 30-day survival was higher in 85/100 (85%) patients after tracheostomy, compared with 27/64 (42%) non-tracheostomised patients {relative risk: 3.9 (95% confidence intervals [CI]: 2.3-6.4); P<0.0001}. In patients with APACHE-II scores >=17, 68/100 (68%) tracheotomised patients survived, compared with 12/64 (19%) non-tracheotomised patients (P<0.001). Tracheostomy within 14 days of intubation was associated with shorter duration of ventilation (mean difference: 6.0 days [95% CI: 3.1-9.0]; P<0.0001) and ICU stay (mean difference: 6.7 days [95% CI: 3.7-9.6]; P<0.0001).

272,26580,Human amylin stimulates inflammatory cytokine secretion from human glioma cells.,Chronic neurodegeneration in the brains of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients may be mediated  at least in part  by the ability of amyloid beta (Abeta) to exacerbate inflammatory pathways in a conformation-dependent manner. In this regard  we previously reported that the Abeta-peptide-mediated potentiation of inflammatory cytokine secretion from interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta)-stimulated human astrocytoma cells was conformation dependent. Other amyloidogenic peptides  such as human amylin  which display similar conformation-dependent neurotoxic effects  may also elicit inflammatory cytokine secretion from glial cells. To test this hypothesis  we compared human and rat amylin for the effects on cytokine production in U-373 MG human astrocytoma cells. Human amylin alone stimulated U-373 MG cells to secrete IL-6 and IL-8 in a concentration-dependent manner with maximum effects seen at 10-25 microM peptide. In addition  human amylin markedly potentiated IL-1beta-stimulated cytokine production with a similar concentration dependence. In contrast  nonamyloidogenic rat amylin modestly stimulated cytokine secretion  either alone or combined with IL-1beta. Aging human amylin resulted in diminished cytokine secretion  probably due to the formation of large  less active aggregates. In agreement with our previous studies using Abeta  extracellular Ca(2+) was necessary for human amylin stimulation of cytokine secretion. Our data suggest that amyloidogenic peptides promote cytokine secretion through similar beta-sheeted secondary-structure- and extracellular-Ca(2+)-dependent mechanisms.,0,Human amylin stimulates inflammatory cytokine secretion from human glioma cells.Chronic neurodegeneration in the brains of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients may be mediated  at least in part  by the ability of amyloid beta (Abeta) to exacerbate inflammatory pathways in a conformation-dependent manner.

273,18964,Social Distancing to Mitigate COVID-19 Risks Is Associated With COVID-19 Discriminatory Attitudes Among People Living with HIV,"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is an emerging pandemic with heightened concerns for people with compromised immune systems, including people living with HIV. PURPOSE: In the absence of a vaccine, public health messaging to mitigate risks for COVID-19 primarily focuses on social distancing. Because people living with HIV commonly experience mistreatment associated with HIV, their response to social distancing may be complicated by psychosocial attitudes associated with COVID-19. METHODS: To evaluate these relationships, we conducted a rapid-response, cross-sectional survey with people living with HIV (N = 149) to assess social distancing practices, COVID-19 discriminatory attitudes, COVID-19 xenophobic attitudes, HIV microaggressions, and concern over contracting COVID-19. Data were collected from participants enrolled in a larger ongoing study between March 30, 2020 and April 17, 2020. RESULTS: Results indicated that choosing to socially distance to reduce COVID-19 exposure was associated with COVID-19 discriminatory attitudes, concerns of contracting COVID-19, and identifying as transgender. Likewise, social distancing imposed by others (e.g., cancelations and restrictions) was associated with concerns of contracting COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Findings demonstrate that social distancing measures are related to concerns of contracting the virus and discriminatory attitudes toward those who are presumed to be living with COVID-19. These potentially negative psychosocial attitudes toward people perceived to have COVID-19 echo the discriminatory actions and attitudes that we continue to observe in HIV social sciences research.

274,7173,Prevalence and predictors of early COVID-19 behavioral intentions in the United States,"Despite early warnings and calls for action, COVID-19 infection rates continue to climb in many areas of the United States. The current study examined participants' reported likelihood of engaging in eight behaviors designated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as critical for the prevention of COVID-19 at the outset of the epidemic. Self-efficacy, perceived threat, and internal and external health locus of control were explored as potential predictors of those behaviors. In addition, demographic and contextual factors, such as age, gender, political identity, and whether or not participants were currently living under a quarantine advisory, were recorded for analysis. Overall, participants reported high engagement with the prevention behaviors. Higher levels of self-efficacy, perceived severity of the illness, and external locus of control in regard to medical professionals were all positively associated with plans to take the recommended precautions. Based on the results, it appears that messaging regarding COVID-19 prevention may be particularly effective when it focuses on the high risk of the illness, the ease with which the prevention behaviors can be taken, and a reassurance that the medical establishment has individuals' best health in mind when it makes its specific recommendations. While numerous countries have succeeded in reducing the spread of COVID-19, the number of new cases in the United States remains high, even relative to other populations also heavily impacted by the disease [1]. Although it would be difficult to pinpoint a single cause or explanation for the epidemic's course in the USA, at the heart of its spread, like the spread of all infectious diseases, is noncompliance with preventative measures. The current research served as a preliminary exploration of the prevalence and predictors of eight COVID-19 prevention behaviors. A brief survey was sent out at the end of March 2020 to 350 U.S. residents in order to assess the likelihood of their engaging in various prevention behaviors recommended at that time and several related psychosocial factors. The psychological factors assessed included health locus of control (HLOC) beliefs, self-efficacy, and perceived threat. In addition, a handful of demographic and contextual factors, such as age, gender, political identity, and whether or not they were working outside the home or were currently living under a quarantine advisory, were recorded for examination.

277,2348,51.20 the Mediating Role of Acceptance in the Relationship between Covid-19 Impact and Depression in Young Adults,"Objectives: The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has led to increased experiences of despair, isolation, and a growing uncertainty surrounding the future of our global health. The effects of the pandemic are evident in almost all aspects of daily life, from the risks to physical health to loss of employment and the ability to attend school. Emerging adults are among the many individuals facing increases in mental illness during this time. Acceptance is a well-researched emotion regulation strategy that has been associated with positive outcomes such as decreased negative affect and greater psychological health in young adults. This study investigated the hypothesis that acceptance use is a mediator in the relationship between the perceived impact of COVID-19 and symptoms of depression among emerging adults. Method(s): Participants in this IRB-approved study were recruited via online flyers distributed through listservs and social media. The sample (n =303; 79% female; 8.8% Hispanic; Mage = 20.9 years) completed a series of online self-report measures, assessing for current levels of depression, the perceived impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the use of acceptance. Result(s): A linear regression indicated that the COVID-19 impact is significantly associated with depression (b = 0.77; p < 0.001). Further regression analyses were conducted using Hayes's PROCESS macro in SPSS. The overall model was significant (F2,300 = 107.7; p < 0.001; R2 = 0.42), accounting for 42% of the variance. The path between the COVID-19 impact and acceptance use was significant (b = 0.71; p = 0.26), indicating that higher levels of COVID-19 impact are associated with less acceptance use. The path between acceptance use and depression was also significant (b = 0.44; p = 0.0025), indicating that higher levels of acceptance use is related to lower levels of depression. The indirect path from COVID-19 impact to depression remained significant when acceptance use was included in the model (b = 0.36; p < 0.001). Conclusion(s): The results indicate that acceptance partially explains the relationship between the perceived COVID-19 impact and current depression. This study highlights the importance of incorporating acceptance use within treatment interventions for young adults who have been heavily impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and may be struggling with symptoms of depression.

279,15390,Rapid Deployment of Inpatient Telemedicine In Response to COVID-19 Across Three Health Systems,"OBJECTIVE: To reduce pathogen exposure, conserve personal protective equipment, and facilitate health care personnel work participation in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic, three affiliated institutions rapidly and independently deployed inpatient telemedicine programs during March 2020. We describe key features and early learnings of these programs in the hospital setting. METHODS: Relevant clinical and operational leadership from an academic medical center, pediatric teaching hospital, and safety net county health system met to share learnings shortly after deploying inpatient telemedicine. A summative analysis of their learnings was re-circulated for approval. RESULTS: All three institutions faced pressure to urgently standup new telemedicine systems while still maintaining secure information exchange. Differences across patient demographics and technological capabilities led to variation in solution design, though key technical considerations were similar. Rapid deployment in each system relied on readily available consumer-grade technology, given the existing familiarity to patients and clinicians and minimal infrastructure investment. Preliminary data from the academic medical center over one month suggested positive adoption with 631 inpatient video calls lasting an average (standard deviation) of 16.5 minutes (19.6) based on inclusion criteria. DISCUSSION: The threat of an imminent surge of COVID-19 patients drove three institutions to rapidly develop inpatient telemedicine solutions. Concurrently, federal and state regulators temporarily relaxed restrictions that would have previously limited these efforts. Strategic direction from executive leadership, leveraging off-the-shelf hardware, vendor engagement, and clinical workflow integration facilitated rapid deployment. CONCLUSION: The rapid deployment of inpatient telemedicine is feasible across diverse settings as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Copyright Â© The Author(s) 2020.

285,21394,"SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in the air and on surfaces in the COVID-19 ward of a hospital in Milan, Italy","The COVID-19 outbreak has rapidly progressed worldwide finding the health system, scientists and society unprepared to face a little-known, fast spreading, and extremely deadly virus. Italy is one of the countries hardest hit by the pandemic, resulting in healthcare facilities bearing heavy burdens and severe restrictive measures. Despite efforts to clarify the virus transmission, especially in indoor scenarios, several aspects of SARS-CoV-2 spread are still rudimentary. This study evaluated the contamination of the air and surfaces by SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the COVID-19 isolation ward of a hospital in Milan, Italy. A total of 42 air and surface samples were collected inside five different zones of the ward including contaminated (COVID-19 patients' area), semi-contaminated (undressing room), and clean areas. SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection was performed using real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Overall, 24.3% of swab samples were positive, but none of these were collected in the clean area. Thus, the positivity rate was higher in contaminated (35.0%) and semi-contaminated (50.0%) areas than in clean areas (0.0%; P<0.05). The most contaminated surfaces were hand sanitizer dispensers (100.0%), medical equipment (50.0%), medical equipment touch screens (50.0%), shelves for medical equipment (40.0%), bedrails (33.3%), and door handles (25.0%). All the air samples collected from the contaminated area, namely the intensive care unit and corridor, were positive while viral RNA was not detected in either semi-contaminated or clean areas. These results showed that environmental contamination did not involve clean areas, but the results also support the need for strict disinfection, hand hygiene and protective measures for healthcare workers as well as the need for airborne isolation precautions.

Italy is one of the countries hardest hit by the pandemic, resulting in healthcare facilities bearing heavy burdens and severe restrictive measures. Despite efforts to clarify the virus transmission, especially in indoor scenarios, several aspects of SARS-CoV-2 spread are still rudimentary. This study evaluated the contamination of the air and surfaces by SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the COVID-19 isolation ward of a hospital in Milan, Italy. A total of 42 air and surface samples were collected inside five different zones of the ward including contaminated (COVID-19 patients' area), semi-contaminated (undressing room), and clean areas. SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection was performed using real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Overall, 24.3% of swab samples were positive, but none of these were collected in the clean area. Thus, the positivity rate was higher in contaminated (35.0%) and semi-contaminated (50.0%) areas than in clean areas (0.0%; P<0.05). The most contaminated surfaces were hand sanitizer dispensers (100.0%), medical equipment (50.0%), medical equipment touch screens (50.0%), shelves for medical equipment (40.0%), bedrails (33.3%), and door handles (25.0%). All the air samples collected from the contaminated area, namely the intensive care unit and corridor, were positive while viral RNA was not detected in either semi-contaminated or clean areas. These results showed that environmental contamination did not involve clean areas, but the results also support the need for strict disinfection, hand hygiene and protective measures for healthcare workers as well as the need for airborne isolation precautions.

286,32185,Management of spine trauma in COVID-19 pandemic: A preliminary report,"Background: COVID-19 was first identified in Iran in February 2020 and since then it spread rapidly through all over the country and soon after that it was reported as a pandemic. The current study presents a preliminary report of spine trauma management during COVID-19 pandemic. Method(s): A cross sectional study was designed to evaluate patients admitted for vertebral fractures with diagnosis of COVID-19 infection on February and March 2020. Analysis was made based on clinical and laboratory data along with the imaging findings from chest HRCT. Result(s): Seven patients with spine trauma including five males and two females ranging from 14 to 59 years were diagnosed for COVID-19 infection through CT-scan findings. Except one, all other patients were asymptomatic for COVID-19 at the time of admission. In three cases the COVID diagnosis was made the day after arrival and in others after 10, 14 and 35 days. Five patients were treated surgically among whom four were admitted to ICU soon after the surgery. The mean ICU stay for operated patients were eight days and the mean hospital stay was 22.6 days. Conclusion(s): Proper diagnosis of COVID-19 is the keystone to protect both patients and health care providers. During the pandemic all admitted patients should be screened for COVID-19 infection. Unnecessary procedures for spine trauma patients should be avoided in order to reduce complications related to surgery and to preserve ICU beds.Copyright Â© 2020 BY THE ARCHIVES OF BONE AND JOINT SURGERY.",0,"Management of spine trauma in COVID-19 pandemic: A preliminary reportBackground: COVID-19 was first identified in Iran in February 2020 and since then it spread rapidly through all over the country and soon after that it was reported as a pandemic.

287,40601,Alzheimer disease alters the relationship of cardiorespiratory fitness with brain activity during the stroop task.,BACKGROUND: Despite mounting evidence that physical activity has positive benefits for brain and cognitive health  there has been little characterization of the relationship between cardiorespiratory (CR) fitness and cognition-associated brain activity as measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The lack of evidence is particularly glaring for diseases such as Alzheimer disease (AD) that degrade cognitive and functional performance. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to describe the relationship between regional brain activity during cognitive tasks and CR fitness level in people with and without AD. DESIGN: A case-control  single-observation study design was used. METHODS: Thirty-four individuals (18 without dementia and 16 in the earliest stages of AD) completed maximal exercise testing and performed a Stroop task during fMRI. RESULTS: Cardiorespiratory fitness was inversely associated with anterior cingulate activity in the participants without dementia (r=-.48  P=.05) and unassociated with activation in those with AD (P>.7). Weak associations of CR fitness and middle frontal cortex were noted. LIMITATIONS: The wide age range and the use of a single task in fMRI rather than multiple tasks challenging different cognitive capacities were limitations of the study. CONCLUSIONS: The results offer further support of the relationship between CR fitness and regional brain activity. However  this relationship may be attenuated by disease. Future work in this area may provide clinicians and researchers with interpretable and dependable regional fMRI biomarker signatures responsive to exercise intervention. It also may shed light on mechanisms by which exercise can support cognitive function.,0,Alzheimer disease alters the relationship of cardiorespiratory fitness with brain activity during the stroop task.BACKGROUND: Despite mounting evidence that physical activity has positive benefits for brain and cognitive health  there has been little characterization of the relationship between cardiorespiratory (CR) fitness and cognition-associated brain activity as measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).

The SMART-MR study.,Visual rating of hippocampal atrophy is often used to differentiate between normal aging and Alzheimer's disease. We investigated whether two visual rating scales of hippocampal atrophy were related to hippocampal volumes  and if visual rating was related to global  cortical and subcortical brain atrophy in persons without dementia. Within the SMART-MR study  a prospective cohort study among patients with manifest arterial disease  medial temporal lobe atrophy was qualitatively rated in 95 participants without dementia (mean age 62 +/- 10 years) using two visual rating scales: the medial temporal lobe (MTA) score was rated on coronal oriented images and the perihippocampal cerebrospinal fluid (HCSF) score was rated on axial oriented images. Hippocampal volume assessed by manual segmentation on a 3-dimensional FFE T1-weighted MR image. Automated segmentation was used to quantify volumes of brain tissue and cerebrospinal fluid. Total brain volume  gray matter volume  and ventricular volume were divided by intracranial volume to obtain brain parenchymal fraction (BPF)  gray matter fraction (GMF) and ventricular fraction (VF). Using ANOVA  crude hippocampal volumes were smaller with increasing MTA and HSCF scores as were hippocampal volumes normalized for intracranial volume (P < 0.05). However  hippocampal volumes normalized for total brain size were not smaller with increasing MTA or HSCF scores (P = 0.33 and P = 0.49). Also  with increasing visual rating scores  BPF was smaller and VF was larger (P < 0.001)  and the GMF decreased with increasing HCSF score (P = 0.008).

289,9148,In vitro effect of PPAR-gamma2 Pro12Ala polymorphism on the deposition of Alzheimer's amyloid-beta peptides.,Mounting evidence suggests that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma) is involved in the modulation of pathogenic events related to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Such events would include the cerebral deposition of amyloid-beta (Abeta) and the consequent local inflammatory response. PPAR-gamma has been shown to act on both fronts  reducing either the secretion of Abeta or the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Recently  the relatively common Pro12Ala polymorphism in exon 2 of PPAR-gamma has been associated with higher risk for late onset AD. Here  we compare the effect of PPAR-gamma and its genetic variant on the secretion of Abeta. Our results indicate that  in neuronal cultured cells  the Pro12Ala substitution does not affect the anti-amyloidogenic capacity of PPAR-gamma. Additional factors  PPAR-gamma related  may therefore predispose aged subjects  carrying the Ala allele  to develop the neurodegenerative disease.,0,In vitro effect of PPAR-gamma2 Pro12Ala polymorphism on the deposition of Alzheimer's amyloid-beta peptides.Mounting evidence suggests that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma) is involved in the modulation of pathogenic events related to Alzheimer's disease (AD).

Using an orthopaedic elective surgery model, we aimed to answer the following: (1) What is the expected recovery time until the health-care system is back to nearly full capacity for performing elective surgery? (2) What will be the expected backlog of elective surgery over time? (3) How should health care change to address the backlog? METHODS: A Monte Carlo stochastic simulation-based analysis was performed to forecast the post-pandemic volume of elective, inpatient total joint arthroplasty and spinal fusion surgical cases. The cumulative backlog was calculated and analyzed. We tested model assumptions with sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: Assuming that elective orthopaedic surgery resumes in June 2020, it will take 7, 12, and 16 months-in optimistic, ambivalent, and pessimistic scenarios, respectively-until the health-care system can perform 90% of the expected pre-pandemic forecasted volume of surgery. In the optimistic scenario, there will be a cumulative backlog of >1 million surgical cases at 2 years after the end of elective-surgery deferment.

Liver injury can be multifactorial and heterogeneous and often requires extensive workup and close follow up (1). CASE PRESENTATION: A 51-year-old male with a history of hypertension and diabetes was admitted with fever and breathlessness secondary to COVID-19 and started on hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and azithromycin. His routine blood work, including a complete metabolic panel, was unremarkable. He was intubated for progressive hypoxia, and given the elevated ferritin-5088 ng/dL and D-Dimer >2500mg/L, he was started on high-dose heparin infusion for anticoagulation. His ferritin and D-Dimer continued to uptrend, and on day 10, he was noted to have a total bilirubin of 8.4 mg/dL. Highest peak values noted, aspartate aminotransferase-229, alanine aminotransferase-167, alkaline phosphatase-162, total bilirubin-22, and direct bilirubin-15.5. Tests for hepatitis A, B, C, HSV, EBV, hemolysis workup, and imaging studies were unremarkable. After a week, the liver enzymes and bilirubin down trended and returned to baseline spontaneously. No clear etiology was ascertained and was presumed multifactorial likely from viral hepatitis, sepsis or drug-induced cholestasis. His hospital course was also complicated by acute renal failure requiring renal replacement therapy, coagulopathy, and encephalopathy which coincided with liver injury trailing behind the peak of inflammatory markers. He underwent tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placement prior to discharge after 7 weeks. DISCUSSION: Emerging data support the hypothesis that liver injury in COVID-19 is often the result of SARS-CoV-2 directly binding to ACE2+ cholangiocytes, leading to cholangiohepatitis. In addition, cytokine storm may further exacerbate the hepatic injury in COVID-19 (2). Although our patient lacked any known risk factors for liver injury and preexisting liver disease, he developed a significant hyperbilirubinemia and transaminitis without sequalae. Hepatic congestion in ventilated patients, shock liver and particularly, drug-induced liver injury (DILI) remains an important consideration in COVID-19 patients. Initiating antiviral therapy and curtailing cytokine dysregulation at an early stage could be beneficial to curb the disease progression (3). CONCLUSION(S): COVID-19 induced viral hepatitis is now being increasingly identified as a self-resolving complication and the physician should be mindful of it and in the right setting, it may only be a clinical distraction.

295,31945,Anti-RAGE and Abeta immunoglobulin levels are related to dementia level and cognitive performance.,BACKGROUND: Blood-based immunoglobulins (IgGs) may mark the presence of amyloid plaques characterizing the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Previous studies suggest that anti-RAGE and anti-Abeta IgGs increase proportionately with accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides at receptor sites for advanced glycation end products (RAGE)  within cortical areas of brain tissue. We assessed the relationship between these potential markers and an AD-type cognitive profile. We hypothesized that these specific IgG levels would be positively correlated with Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scores as well as index scores on the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) in domains associated with cortical function. METHODS: Participants were 118 older adults (mean age = 74  standard deviation = 10.5) drawn from the community and local physician referrals. Participants were reassigned into five groups based on CDR. Blood IgG levels were determined through an affinity purification process. RESULTS: Analysis of covariance analyses revealed that CDR scores were significantly related to anti-RAGE  F(4 106) = 12.93  p < .001  and anti-Abeta  F(4 106) = 17.08  p < .001  after controlling for age and total IgG levels. Regression analyses indicated significant variance accounted for by anti-RAGE and anti-Abeta above and beyond total IgG effects. Additional regression identified specific RBANS domains accounting for significant variance in anti-RAGE levels including language (t = -3.74  p < .001) and delayed memory (t = -2.31  p < .05)  whereas language accounted for a significant amount of variance in anti-Abeta levels (t = -3.96  p < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Anti-RAGE and anti-Abeta IgGs correlate strongly with global scores of dementia. Furthermore  they are associated with a profile of deficiency in domains associated with specific cortical function.

297,49613,Altered levels and distribution of IGF-II/M6P receptor and lysosomal enzymes in mutant APP and APP + PS1 transgenic mouse brains.,The insulin-like growth factor-II/mannose-6-phosphate (IGF-II/M6P) receptor participates in the trafficking of lysosomal enzymes from the trans-Golgi network or the cell surface to lysosomes. In Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains  marked up-regulation of the lysosomal system in vulnerable neuronal populations has been correlated with altered metabolic functions. To establish whether IGF-II/M6P receptors and lysosomal enzymes are altered in the brain of transgenic mice harboring different familial AD mutations  we measured the levels and distribution of the receptor and lysosomal enzymes cathepsins B and D in select brain regions of transgenic mice overexpressing either mutant presenilin 1 (PS1; PS1(M146L+L286V))  amyloid precursor protein (APP; APP(KM670/671NL+V717F)) or APP+PS1 (APP(KM670/671NL+V717F)+PS1(M146L+L286V)) transgenes. Our results revealed that levels and expression of the IGF-II/M6P receptor and lysosomal enzymes are increased in the hippocampus and frontal cortex of APP and APP+PS1  but not in PS1  transgenic mouse brains compared with wild-type controls. The changes were more prominent in APP+PS1 than in APP single transgenic mice. Additionally  all beta-amyloid-containing neuritic plaques in the hippocampal and cortical regions of APP and APP+PS1 transgenic mice were immunopositive for both lysosomal enzymes  whereas only a subset of the plaques displayed IGF-II/M6P receptor immunoreactivity. These results suggest that up-regulation of the IGF-II/M6P receptor and lysosomal enzymes in neurons located in vulnerable regions reflects an altered functioning of the endosomal-lysosomal system which may be associated with the increased intracellular and/or extracellular A beta deposits observed in APP and APP+PS1 transgenic mouse brains.,0,Altered levels and distribution of IGF-II/M6P receptor and lysosomal enzymes in mutant APP and APP + PS1 transgenic mouse brains.The insulin-like growth factor-II/mannose-6-phosphate (IGF-II/M6P) receptor participates in the trafficking of lysosomal enzymes from the trans-Golgi network or the cell surface to lysosomes.

300,517,Multiple assays in a real-time RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 panel can mitigate the risk of loss of sensitivity by new genomic variants during the COVID-19 outbreak,"OBJECTIVES: In this study, five SARS-CoV-2 PCR assay panels were evaluated against the accumulated genetic variability of the virus to assess the effect on sensitivity of the individual assays. DESIGN OR METHODS: As of week 21, 2020, the complete set of available SARS-CoV-2 genomes from GISAID and GenBank databases were used in this study. SARS-CoV-2 primer sequences from publicly available panels (WHO, CDC, NMDC, and HKU) and QIAstat-Dx were included in the alignment, and accumulated genetic variability affecting any oligonucleotide annealing was annotated. RESULTS: A total of 11,627 (34.38%) genomes included single mutations affecting annealing of any PCR assay. Variations in 8,773 (25.94%) genomes were considered as high risk, whereas additional 2,854 (8.43%) genomes presented low frequent single mutations and were predicted to yield no impact on sensitivity. In case of the QIAstat-Dx SARS-CoV-2 Panel, 99.11% of the genomes matched with a 100% coverage all oligonucleotides, and critical variations were tested in vitro corroborating no loss of sensitivity. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis stresses the importance of targeting more than one region in the viral genome for SARS-CoV-2 detection to mitigate the risk of loss of sensitivity due to the unknown mutation rate during this SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.INTRODUCTIONSince the beginning of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak in December 2019 (Zhu et al., 2020), the number of confirmed cases has been rising dramatically (The Open Science Prize, 2020). According to data from the World Health Organization (WHO), Coronavirus Disease 2019 or COVID-19 (Gorbalenya et al., 2020) has been diagnosed in over 6,057,853 people from more than 200 countries or territories and caused over 371,166 deaths worldwide as of 1 June 2020 (World Health Organization, 2020a). SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh coronavirus known to infect humans and it appears to have its origin from zoonotic transmission similar to SARS-CoV (2002) and MERS-CoV (2012) (Andersen et al., 2020). SARS-CoV-2 is hypothesised to be the product of recombination or mutation from a genetically related SARS-CoV species hosted by bats (Sun et al., 2020). Unlike seasonal human coronaviruses HKU1, NL63, OC43 and 229E which are associated with mild symptoms (Corman et al., 2018), SARS-CoV-2 can cause pneumonia and severe acute respiratory syndrome (Andersen et al., 2020). All coronaviruses are single, positive-stranded RNA viruses with similar genomic ~30kb size and structure. These genes encode non-structural proteins (ORF1a and ORF1b) involved in replication at the 5'-end and multiple structural proteins (spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N)) downstream that make up the virus particle (Chan et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020). During novel RNA viral outbreaks, detection of the virus relies on real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (real-time RT-PCR) for detection of the RNA of the virus In the case of SARS-CoV-2, RT-PCR is used for confirmatory diagnosis of symptomatic patients as well as increasingly screening of asymptomatic contacts and subjects at risk. The unprecedented outbreak posed the challenge of evaluating the different diagnostic RT-PCR assays sensitivity and specificity without a previous established gold standard.Since the availability of the first SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequence (Wu et al., 2020), several studies have reported a rapid genetic evolution of SARS-CoV-2 through a phylogenetic tree tracking the geographical spread of the virus (Andersen et al., 2020; The Open Science Prize, 2020; Wu et al., 2020; Yi, 2020). As previously established for RNA viruses, the nucleotide mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 is estimated to be 8E-04 substitutions per site per year as a consequence of the lack of proofreading activity of polymerases (Lauring and Andino, 2020; The Open Science Prize, 2020). It evinces that new genetic variations of SARS-CoV-2 that will most likely occur during this evolving outbreak could compromise the sensitivity and specificity of RT-PCR detection (Lippi et al., 2020). Specifically, both natural mutation rate of a virus (Lauring and Andino, 2020) and active viral recombination (Yi, 2020) could potentially impair the efficiency of oligonucleotide annealing (Lippi et al., 2020), affecting sensitivity (increasing the limit of detection) or inclusivity (missed detection of some strains due to genomic changes). We hypothesize that in order to minimize the risk of sensitivity loss of RT-PCR for detecting novel viruses with unknown genetic variability like SARS-CoV-2, published RT-PCR design strategies for SARS-CoV-2 detection should target more than one region in the viral genome. This was the general approach followed to obtain the earliest available SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assays in panels used worldwide (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020a, 2020b; Chu et al., 2020; Corman et al., 2020; National Microbiology Data Center, 2020; QIAstat-Dx Respiratory SARS-CoV-2 Panel, 2020; University of Hong Kong, 2020; World Health Organization, 2020b), including the syndromic multiplex QIAstat-Dx Respiratory SA",0,"Multiple assays in a real-time RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 panel can mitigate the risk of loss of sensitivity by new genomic variants during the COVID-19 outbreakOBJECTIVES: In this study, five SARS-CoV-2 PCR assay panels were evaluated against the accumulated genetic variability of the virus to assess the effect on sensitivity of the individual assays.

301,54869,Bioinformatic prediction of potential T cell epitopes for SARS-Cov-2,"To control and prevent the current COVID-19 pandemic, the development of novel vaccines is an emergent issue. In addition, we need to develop tools that can measure/monitor T-cell and B-cell responses to know how our immune system is responding to this deleterious virus. However, little information is currently available about the immune target epitopes of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) to induce host immune responses. Through a comprehensive bioinformatic screening of potential epitopes derived from the SARS-CoV-2 sequences for HLAs commonly present in the Japanese population, we identified 2013 and 1399 possible peptide epitopes that are likely to have the high affinity (<0.5%- and 2%-rank, respectively) to HLA class I and II molecules, respectively, that may induce CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell responses. These epitopes distributed across the structural (spike, envelope, membrane, and nucleocapsid proteins) and the nonstructural proteins (proteins corresponding to six open reading frames); however, we found several regions where high-affinity epitopes were significantly enriched. By comparing the sequences of these predicted T cell epitopes to the other coronaviruses, we identified 781 HLA-class I and 418 HLA-class II epitopes that have high homologies to SARS-CoV. To further select commonly-available epitopes that would be applicable to larger populations, we calculated population coverages based on the allele frequencies of HLA molecules, and found 2 HLA-class I epitopes covering 83.8% of the Japanese population.

302,66775,Clinical characteristics and outcomes of the patients with COVID-19: A report of 62 cases. [Chinese],"Objective To investigate the early clinical characteristics and diagnosis of and therapeutic approaches for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Methods The clinical manifestations and treatment of 62 patients with COVID-19 admitted to Hainan Province People's Hospital during the period from January 21 to February 10, 2019 were analyzed retrospectively. The COVID-19 patients were classified into 3 groups: general, severe and critical types according to the disease severity and the white blood cell, neutrophil and lymphocyte counts were compared between the 3 groups. The 62 patients were given symptomatic and supportive, antiviral, hormonal and Chinese herbal treatment. Results 79.03% (49/62) of patients had a history of traveling or living in Wuhan. The incubation period was (6.85+/-4.45) d. The clinical features including fever (80.65%), dry cough (62.9%), fatigue (25.81%), shortness of breath (19.35%), and dyspnea (14.52%), sore throat (9.68%), nasal congestion and runny nose (9.68%), muscle soreness (8.06%), diarrhea, vomiting (3.23%), and nausea (4.84%). 95.16% (59/62) of patients had normal or relatively low white blood cell counts. There were statistically significant differences in the counts of leukocytes, neutrophils, and lymphocytes between the 3 groups of the patients (P<0.05). 77.78% (7/9) of the critically ill patients with lymphocyte counts below 0.8x109/L. 90.32% (56/62) of patients typically presented with single or multiple lung lobes/ segments showing ground glass shadow. The average time for CT and CR showing progress and starting to improve and absorb was (9.05+/-3.75) d and (14.94+/-7.32) d, respectively. The total course of disease among the 57 discharged patients was 9-38 d, with an average of (21.05+/-7.17) d. The length of hospital stay was 8-34 d, with an average hospital stay of (15.32+/-6.49) d. After treatment, the time of the negative mutation of the novel coronavirus was (11.56+/-6.56) d. Obvious dyspnea occurred in 9 critically ill patients, among them 7 patients needed invasive ventilator support and 2 non-invasive ventilator support. Conclusions In the early clinical stage of COVID-19, fever is the main manifestation. Individual patients are asymptomatic. CT is characterized by ground glass-like changes.

[Chinese]Objective To investigate the early clinical characteristics and diagnosis of and therapeutic approaches for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Methods The clinical manifestations and treatment of 62 patients with COVID-19 admitted to Hainan Province People's Hospital during the period from January 21 to February 10, 2019 were analyzed retrospectively. The COVID-19 patients were classified into 3 groups: general, severe and critical types according to the disease severity and the white blood cell, neutrophil and lymphocyte counts were compared between the 3 groups. The 62 patients were given symptomatic and supportive, antiviral, hormonal and Chinese herbal treatment. Results 79.03% (49/62) of patients had a history of traveling or living in Wuhan. The incubation period was (6.85+/-4.45) d. The clinical features including fever (80.65%), dry cough (62.9%), fatigue (25.81%), shortness of breath (19.35%), and dyspnea (14.52%), sore throat (9.68%), nasal congestion and runny nose (9.68%), muscle soreness (8.06%), diarrhea, vomiting (3.23%), and nausea (4.84%). 95.16% (59/62) of patients had normal or relatively low white blood cell counts. There were statistically significant differences in the counts of leukocytes, neutrophils, and lymphocytes between the 3 groups of the patients (P<0.05). 77.78% (7/9) of the critically ill patients with lymphocyte counts below 0.8x109/L. 90.32% (56/62) of patients typically presented with single or multiple lung lobes/ segments showing ground glass shadow. The average time for CT and CR showing progress and starting to improve and absorb was (9.05+/-3.75) d and (14.94+/-7.32) d, respectively. The total course of disease among the 57 discharged patients was 9-38 d, with an average of (21.05+/-7.17) d. The length of hospital stay was 8-34 d, with an average hospital stay of (15.32+/-6.49) d. After treatment, the time of the negative mutation of the novel coronavirus was (11.56+/-6.56) d.

303,61626,What happens to personal identity when semantic knowledge degrades? A study of the self and autobiographical memory in semantic dementia.,While the self has been extensively explored in amnesic patients with severe episodic but not semantic memory disturbance  little is known about the self in semantic dementia (SD)  which generally features the reverse pattern of impairment. In the present study  we investigated the structural (self-representations) and functional (consciousness) dimensions of the self in a group of eight SD patients in the early to moderate stages of the disease. We used two original tasks designed to probe both structural characteristics  namely the strength and the certainty of self-concept and the episodic/semantic nature of self-representations  and functional characteristics  namely autonoetic/noetic level of consciousness  self-evaluation and self-projection into the past  present and future. Results for the structural self showed impairment on the semantic aspects of the self-representations  except for those related to the present. Moreover  SD patients were affected regardless of the episodic or semantic nature of self-representations into the future. As regards the functional self  self-projection and level of consciousness were only impaired for the future. This study confirms the persistence of a feeling of identity in SD over time for the past and present selves. However  it also highlights the loss of the future self in SD patients. These results are discussed in relation to models of long-term memory and future thinking focusing on the interplay of episodic and semantic memory and mental time travel.,0,What happens to personal identity when semantic knowledge degrades?

304,34401,Altered directed connectivity in patients with early vascular dementia during a visual oddball task.,The altered functional connectivity in the brain of patients with early vascular dementia (VaD) is poorly understood. Here we investigated the directed connectivity differences between VaD and normal elderly while performing a visual oddball task. Multichannel EEG data during a visual oddball task were recorded for 12 patients with early VaD and 12 age  gender and education matched healthy elderly. Directed transfer function was used to investigate the directed connectivity of brain during pre-stimulus and post-stimulus periods in delta  theta  alpha and beta frequency bands. Significantly reduced inter-hemispheric connectivity was found in patients with early VaD compared to normal elderly in the delta and theta frequency bands during the pre-stimulus period. During the post-stimulus period  besides the decreased inter-hemispheric connectivity  significantly decreased parietal-to-frontal/central connectivity was also found in VaD compared to normal elderly in the delta frequency band. In addition to the decreased connectivity in VaD  significantly increased connectivity was also found both in the pre-stimulus and post-stimulus periods. These results suggest that pathophysiology changes in early VaD may cause the altered directed connectivity of the brain network. Our observations demonstrate the altered brain connectivity of early VaD and reveal impairment and compensation co-exist in patients with early VaD.,0,Altered directed connectivity in patients with early vascular dementia during a visual oddball task.The altered functional connectivity in the brain of patients with early vascular dementia (VaD) is poorly understood.

308,41443,Nonoperative management of pancreatic injuries in pediatric patients.,Purpose. Nonoperative management of minor pancreatic injury is the generally accepted approach. However  the management of major pancreatic injury remains controversial in pediatric patients. The aim of the present study was to determine the safety and efficacy of nonoperative management of pancreatic injury in pediatric patients. Methods. Between 2003 and 2009  31 patients  28 male and 3 female  with pancreatic injury due to blunt abdominal trauma were treated in our clinic. All patients were evaluated by ultrasonography  computed tomography (CT)  and evaluation of serum amylase levels. Patients with ongoing hemodynamic instability after resuscitation or signs of bowel perforation underwent immediate laparotomy  and the remaining patients were conservatively treated. Conservative treatment consisted of nasogastric tube replacement  total parenteral nutrition  monitoring of amylase levels  and serial clinical examination. Results. The most common mechanism of injury was a fall (35.4%). Ten patients (32.2%) had associated extraabdominal injuries  and 18 patients (58.1%) had associated abdominal injuries. The spleen was the most common site of intra-abdominal injury that was associated with pancreatic trauma. Initial amylase levels were normal in 5 patients  whose CT scans revealed pancreatic injury. Twenty-five patients (80.6%) were conservatively treated. Six patients (19.4%) required surgical intervention because of a hollow viscus or diaphragmatic injury and hemodynamic instability. A pseudocyst developed in 11 of the 25 patients who were nonoperatively treated; 6 patients required intervention for the pseudocyst (percutaneous drainage and cystogastrostomy). No patient succumbed to injury. Conclusions. The majority of the pancreatic injuries in pediatric patients can be successfully treated conservatively  unless there is hemodynamic instability and a hollow viscus injury. The most common complication is a pseudocyst. © 2011 Springer.,0,Nonoperative management of pancreatic injuries in pediatric patients.Purpose.

309,36540,A phenomenological approach to assessing the effectiveness of COVID-19 related nonpharmaceutical interventions in Germany,"Nonpharmaceutical interventions against the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Germany included the cancellation of mass events (from March 8), closures of schools and child day care facilities (from March 16) as well as a ""lockdown"" (from March 23). This study attempts to assess the effectiveness of these interventions in terms of revealing their impact on infections over time. Dates of infections were estimated from official German case data by incorporating the incubation period and an empirical reporting delay. Exponential growth models for infections and reproduction numbers were estimated and investigated with respect to change points in the time series. A significant decline of daily and cumulative infections as well as reproduction numbers is found at March 8, March 10 and March 3, respectively. Further declines and stabilizations are found in the end of March. There is also a change point in new infections at April 19, but daily infections still show a negative growth. From March 19, the reproduction numbers fluctuate on a level below one. The decline of infections in early March 2020 can be attributed to relatively small interventions and voluntary behavioural changes. Additional effects of later interventions cannot be detected clearly. Liberalizations of measures from April 20 did not induce a re-increase of infections. Thus, the effectiveness of most German interventions remains questionable. Moreover, assessing of interventions is impeded by the estimation of true infection dates and the influence of test volume.Copyright Â© 2020 Elsevier Ltd",0,"A phenomenological approach to assessing the effectiveness of COVID-19 related nonpharmaceutical interventions in GermanyNonpharmaceutical interventions against the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Germany included the cancellation of mass events (from March 8), closures of schools and child day care facilities (from March 16) as well as a ""lockdown"" (from March 23).

312,59705,The knowledge level and perceptions towards COVID-19 among Turkish final year medical students,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has upended medical education as well as the lives of healthcare professionals. Higher education institutions have a crucial role in the solution of public health problems by training young doctor candidates, and it is also essential to increase the knowledge level of physician candidates about the epidemic. So, in this study, we aimed to examine Turkish final year medical students' knowledge level, and perceptions towards the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: The present descriptive multicentered study was conducted with the medical students in the final year of six medical schools located in six geographic regions of Turkey. After ethical approval, data was gathered using an online questionnaire through Google forms between April 10, 2020, and April 20, 2020. RESULTS: In this national survey study, 860 volunteers answered the questions thoroughly. The median age was 24 (22-38) years. 55.3% of the participants were female. The median knowledge level score was 69.0 (0-93.1). The knowledge level was moderate. 34.2% of the participants had a high level of knowledge. 48.7% of participants stated that they felt the most competent about performing CPR. Updates about COVID-19 were followed regularly by 84.5% of the participants. CONCLUSION: We determined that final year medical students are knowledgeable and aware of this pandemic. We, medical educators, should inculcate relevant knowledge and educate the medical students to improve practices in the current pandemic, as well as for future epidemics. Different learning techniques should be added to the curriculum, especially at the time which widespread panic and uncertainty are prevalent.",0,"The knowledge level and perceptions towards COVID-19 among Turkish final year medical studentsBACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has upended medical education as well as the lives of healthcare professionals.

To date, there have not been reports of sinus node dysfunction (SND) associated with COVID-19. This case series describes clinical characteristics, potential mechanisms, and short-term outcomes of COVID-19 patients who experience de novo SND. Case summary: We present two cases of new-onset SND in patients recently diagnosed with COVID-19. Patient 1 is a 70-year-old female with no major past medical history who was intubated for acute hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to COVID-19 pneumonia and developed new-onset sinus bradycardia without a compensatory increase in heart rate in response to relative hypotension. Patient 2 is an 81-year-old male with a past medical history of an ascending aortic aneurysm, hypertension, and obstructive sleep apnoea who required intubation for COVID-19-induced acute hypoxic respiratory failure and exhibited new-onset sinus bradycardia followed by numerous episodes of haemodynamically significant accelerated idioventricular rhythm. Two weeks following the onset of SND, both patients remain in sinus bradycardia. Discussion: COVID-19-associated SND has not previously been described. The potential mechanisms for SND in patients with COVID-19 include myocardial inflammation or direct viral infiltration.

We believe that our experience from such an endeavor could prove invaluable for other mental health specialists and therefore sharing it seems especially timely and valid.Copyright Â© 2020 Polish Psychiatric Association.

316,65920,MR spectroscopy in Alzheimer's disease: gender differences in probabilistic learning capacity.,Degenerative alterations of cortical and subcortical regions in Alzheimer disease (AD) can be estimated by the extent of brain metabolite changes as measured by magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI). A neuropsychological assessment may correlate with metabolite levels and could evaluate underlying degenerative processes. Probabilistic-related classification learning  which represents one form of procedural learning  is associated with the neostriatum. The present study was aimed at examining the correlation of spectroscopic imaging in subcortical regions with the evaluation of specific neuropsychological findings. Twenty-two patients with Alzheimer's disease were compared to 15 healthy elderly control subjects. Proton MRSI of the basal ganglia (BG) and thalamus region was performed for detection of N-acetylaspartate (NAA)  trimethylamine (TMA) and creatine ((P)Cr). In addition  a probabilistic-related classification learning task (Weather Prediction Task (WT)) was applied. We observed that in patients a high TMA signal in the basal ganglia region was correlated with a poorer performance in the probabilistic learning task (Spearman rank order correlation (SROC)=-0.6  P<0.009). Although Alzheimer's patients  as a group  did not differ from controls with regard to probabilistic learning capacity (PLC)  male AD patients  as compared to male controls  displayed an impairment in the task performance by 28% (P<0.03) and showed a 16% elevation in TMA signaling (P<0.04). The altered metabolite signals and ratios in combination with the cognitive performance might suggest gender-related neuronal degeneration and dysfunction within subcortical regions in AD.,0,MR spectroscopy in Alzheimer's disease: gender differences in probabilistic learning capacity.Degenerative alterations of cortical and subcortical regions in Alzheimer disease (AD) can be estimated by the extent of brain metabolite changes as measured by magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI).

318,13103,Ultrasound guidance reduces pneumothorax rate and improves safety of thoracentesis in malignant pleural effusion: Report on 445 consecutive patients with advanced cancer,Background: Malignant pleural effusion (MPE) is an extremely common problem affecting cancer patients  and thoracentesis is an essential procedure in an attempt to delineate the etiology of the fluid collections and to relieve symptoms in affected patients. One of the most common complications of thoracentesis is pneumothorax  which has been reported to occur in 20% to 39% of thoracenteses  with 15% to 50% of patients with pneumothorax requiring tube thoracostomy.The present study was carried out to assess whether thoracenteses in cancer patients performed with ultrasound (US) guidance are associated with a lower rates of pneumothorax and tube thoracostomy than those performed without US guidance.Methods: A total of 445 patients were recruited in this retrospective study. The medical records of 445 consecutive patients with cancer and MPE evaluable for this study  undergoing thoracentesis at the Oncology-Hematology and Internal Medicine Departments  Piacenza Hospital (Italy) were reviewed.Results: From January 2005 to December 2011  in 310 patients (69.66%) thoracentesis was performed with US guidance and in 135 (30.34%) without it. On post-thoracentesis imaging performed in all these cases  15 pneumothoraces (3.37%) were found; three of them (20%) required tube thoracostomy. Pneumothorax occurred in three out of 310 procedures (0.97%) performed with US guidance and in 12 of 135 procedures (8.89%) performed without it (P ¡0.0001). It must be emphasized that in all three patients with pneumothorax requiring tube thoracostomy  thoracentesis was performed without US guidance.Conclusions: The routine use of US guidance during thoracentesis drastically reduces the rate of pneumothorax and tube thoracostomy in oncological patients  thus improving safety as demonstrated in this study. © 2014 Cavanna et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.,0,Ultrasound guidance reduces pneumothorax rate and improves safety of thoracentesis in malignant pleural effusion: Report on 445 consecutive patients with advanced cancerBackground: Malignant pleural effusion (MPE) is an extremely common problem affecting cancer patients  and thoracentesis is an essential procedure in an attempt to delineate the etiology of the fluid collections and to relieve symptoms in affected patients.

320,34813,Guess Who's Coming to Dinner: Covid-19 in a Covid-Free Unit,"Objectives: To assess the impact of the pandemic on surgical activity and the occurrence and features of Covid-19 in a Covid-free urologic unit in a regional hospital in Northern Italy. Methods: Our Department is the only urologic service in the Trento Province, near Lombardy, the epicenter of Covid-19 in our Country. We reviewed the surgical and ward activities during the 4 weeks following the national lockdown (March 9-April 5, 2020). The following outcomes were investigated: surgical load, rate of admissions and bed occupation, and the rate and characteristics of unrecognized Covid-positive patients. Data were compared with that of the same period of 2019 (March 11-April 7). Results and Conclusions: 63%, 70%, 64%, and 71%, decline in surgery, endoscopy, bed occupation, and admission, respectively, occurred during the 4 weeks after the lockdown, as compared to 2019. Urgent procedures also declined by 32%. Three (8%) of 39 admissions regarded unrecognized Covid-19 overlapping or misinterpreted with urgent urologic conditions such as fever-associated urinary stones or hematuria. In spite of a significant reduction of activity, a non-negligible portion of admissions to our Covid-free unit regarded unrecognized Covid-19. In order to preserve its integrity, we propose an enhanced triage prior to the admission to a Covid-free unit including not only routine questions on fever and respiratory symptoms but also non-respiratory symptoms, history of exposure, and a survey about the social and geographic origin of the patient.

321,59439,Pre-existing traits associated with Covid-19 illness severity,"Importance Certain individuals, when infected by SARS-CoV-2, tend to develop the more severe forms of Covid-19 illness for reasons that remain unclear. Objective To determine the demographic and clinical characteristics associated with increased severity of Covid-19 infection. Design Retrospective observational study. We curated data from the electronic health record, and used multivariable logistic regression to examine the association of pre-existing traits with a Covid-19 illness severity defined by level of required care: need for hospital admission, need for intensive care, and need for intubation. Setting A large, multihospital healthcare system in Southern California. Participants All patients with confirmed Covid-19 infection (N = 442). Results Of all patients studied, 48% required hospitalization, 17% required intensive care, and 12% required intubation. In multivariable-adjusted analyses, patients requiring a higher levels of care were more likely to be older (OR 1.5 per 10 years, P<0.001), male (OR 2.0, P = 0.001), African American (OR 2.1, P = 0.011), obese (OR 2.0, P = 0.021), with diabetes mellitus (OR 1.8, P = 0.037), and with a higher comorbidity index (OR 1.8 per SD, P<0.001). Several clinical associations were more pronounced in younger compared to older patients (Pinteraction<0.05). Of all hospitalized patients, males required higher levels of care (OR 2.5, P = 0.003) irrespective of age, race, or morbidity profile. Conclusions and relevance In our healthcare system, greater Covid-19 illness severity is seen in patients who are older, male, African American, obese, with diabetes, and with greater overall comorbidity burden. Certain comorbidities paradoxically augment risk to a greater extent in younger patients. In hospitalized patients, male sex is the main determinant of needing more intensive care.

322,33792,A High Through-put Assay for Circulating Antibodies Directed against the S Protein of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona virus 2,"BACKGROUND: More than one million infections with the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have been confirmed. While PCR-based assays are used for diagnosis, high through-put serologic methods are needed to detect antibodies for seroserveillance and for identification of seroconversion, potential plasma donors, and the nature of the immune response to this pathogen. METHODS: A Luminex binding assay was used to assess the presence of antibodies in human sera from COVID-19-infected and -uninfected individuals specific for two recombinant proteins of SARS-CoV-2. FINDINGS: Fluorochrome-labeled beads were coated with a recombinant soluble stabilized trimeric SARS-CoV-2 S protein ectodomain or its central portion, the receptor binding domain (RBD). Coated beads were incubated with sera, followed by incubation with biotinylated anti-human total Ig antibodies and phycoerythrin (PE)-labeled streptavidin. Readout using a Luminex analyzer clearly differentiated between sera of the infected and uninfected subject, delineating a wide range of serum antibody levels in infected subjects. INTERPRETATION: Antibody assays of sera can identify individuals who are infected with SARS-CoV-2 and have seroconverted, as well as subjects who have been infected and recovered. The use of the Luminex binding Ab assay has the advantage that it can be run in approximately 2.5 hours, uses very little antigen, and permits a high through-put of samples/day.

Eighty patients with a diagnosis of DAT were administered Single Photon Emission Computerized Tomography (SPECT) scans and a battery of left and right hemisphere neuropsychological-based tasks. The results of ANOVA indicated that patients with DAT who were not suffering from perfusion deficits exhibited significantly fewer neuropsychological deficits than did patients with DAT who had perfusion deficits. The neuropsychological tests that measured verbal ability  logical memory  word-pair learning  reading  arithmetic  and visual-perceptual organization were all significantly lower in the group with perfusion deficits.

324,53095,Factors associated with the onset and persistence of post-lumbar puncture headache.,IMPORTANCE: This study assesses factors associated with the most common adverse event following lumbar puncture. OBJECTIVE: To identify factors associated with the risk  onset  and persistence of post-dural puncture headache (PDPH). DESIGN  SETTING  AND PARTICIPANTS: We performed univariate and multivariable analyses of 338 lumbar punctures in the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network observational study using linear mixed models  adjusting for participant-level and family-level random effects. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: We directly evaluated associations of 3 post-lumbar puncture outcomes (immediate postprocedural headache  PDPH at 24-hour follow-up  and PDPH receiving a therapeutic blood patch) with participant age and sex  positioning  collection method  needle size  needle insertion site  and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) volume collected. RESULTS: The incidence of adverse events included 73 immediate postprocedural headaches (21.6%)  59 PDPHs at 24-hour follow-up (17.5%)  and 15 PDPHs receiving a therapeutic blood patch (4.4%). Greater volume of CSF collected was associated with increased risk of immediate postprocedural headache  largely owing to a nonlinear increase in risk on collection of volumes above 30 mL (odds ratio  3.73 for >30 mL and 0.98 for <17 mL). In contrast  collection of higher volumes showed a protective effect in decreasing rates of PDPH at 24-hour follow-up and rates of PDPH receiving a therapeutic blood patch (odds ratio  0.35 per 10 mL). Although differences in needle size did not reach statistical significance  no participant in the 24G needle group received a therapeutic blood patch compared to 8 of 253 for the larger 22G needles. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Factors that acutely lower CSF pressure (eg  seated positioning or extracting very high volumes of CSF) may be associated with transient post-lumbar puncture headache  without increasing rates of persistent PDPH or therapeutic blood patch. Collection of up to 30 mL of CSF appears to be well tolerated and safe.,0,Factors associated with the onset and persistence of post-lumbar puncture headache.IMPORTANCE: This study assesses factors associated with the most common adverse event following lumbar puncture.

Here  we studied the impact of cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1) deficiency on the development of AD pathology by breeding amyloid precursor protein (APP) Swedish mutant mice (APP23)  an AD animal model  with CB1-deficient mice. In addition to the lower body weight of APP23/CB1(-/-) mice  most of these mice died at an age before typical AD-associated changes become apparent. The surviving mice showed a reduced amount of APP and its fragments suggesting a regulatory influence of CB1 on APP processing  which was confirmed by modulating CB1 expression in vitro. Reduced APP levels were accompanied by a reduced plaque load and less inflammation in APP23/CB1(-/-) mice. Nevertheless  compared to APP23 mice with an intact CB1  APP23/CB1(-/-) mice showed impaired learning and memory deficits. These data argue against a direct correlation of amyloid plaque load with cognitive abilities in this AD mouse model lacking CB1. Furthermore  the findings indicate that CB1 deficiency can worsen AD-related cognitive deficits and support a potential role of CB1 as a pharmacologic target.,0,Cannabinoid receptor 1 deficiency in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease leads to enhanced cognitive impairment despite of a reduction in amyloid deposition.Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by amyloid-ﾎｲ deposition in amyloid plaques  neurofibrillary tangles  inflammation  neuronal loss  and cognitive deficits.

327,202,Differential expression of CD163 on monocyte subsets in healthy and HIV-1 infected individuals.,CD163  a haptoglobin-hemoglobin (Hp-Hb) scavenger receptor  expressed by monocytes and macrophages  is important in resolution of inflammation. Age-related non-AIDS co-morbidities in HIV-infected individuals  particularly dementia and cardiovascular disease  result in part from effects of HIV-1 infection on monocyte and macrophage biology. CD163 co-expression on CD14+CD16++ monocytes has been proposed as a useful biomarker for HIV-1 disease progression and the presence of HIV associated dementia. Here we investigated CD163 expression on monocyte subsets ex vivo  on cultured macrophages  and soluble in plasma  in the setting of HIV-1 infection. Whole blood immunophenotyping revealed CD163 expression on CD14++CD16- monocytes but not on CD14+CD16++ monocytes (P窶=窶0.004)  supported by CD163 mRNA levels. Incubation with M-CSF induced CD163 protein expression on CD14+CD16++ monocytes to the same extent as CD14++CD16- monocytes. CD163 expression on CD14++CD16+ monocytes from HIV-infected subjects was significantly higher than from uninfected individuals  with a trend towards increased expression on CD14++CD16- monocytes (P窶=窶0.019 and 0.069 respectively)  which is accounted for by HIV-1 therapy including protease inhibitors. Shedding of CD163 was shown to predominantly occur from the CD14++CD16- subset after Ficoll isolation and LPS stimulation. Soluble CD163 concentration in plasma from HIV-1 infected donors was similar to HIV-1 uninfected donors. Monocyte CD163 expression in HIV-1 infected patients showed a complicated relationship with classical measures of disease progression. Our findings clarify technical issues regarding CD163 expression on monocyte subsets and further elucidates its role in HIV-associated inflammation by demonstrating that CD163 is readily lost from CD14++CD16- monocytes and induced in pro-inflammatory CD14+CD16++ monocytes by M-CSF. Our data show that all monocyte subsets are potentially capable of differentiating into CD163-expressing anti-inflammatory macrophages given appropriate stimuli. Levels of CD163 expression on monocytes may be a potential biomarker reflecting efforts by the immune system to resolve immune activation and inflammation in HIV-infected individuals.,0,Differential expression of CD163 on monocyte subsets in healthy and HIV-1 infected individuals.CD163  a haptoglobin-hemoglobin (Hp-Hb) scavenger receptor  expressed by monocytes and macrophages  is important in resolution of inflammation. Age-related non-AIDS co-morbidities in HIV-infected individuals  particularly dementia and cardiovascular disease  result in part from effects of HIV-1 infection on monocyte and macrophage biology. CD163 co-expression on CD14+CD16++ monocytes has been proposed as a useful biomarker for HIV-1 disease progression and the presence of HIV associated dementia. Here we investigated CD163 expression on monocyte subsets ex vivo  on cultured macrophages  and soluble in plasma  in the setting of HIV-1 infection. Whole blood immunophenotyping revealed CD163 expression on CD14++CD16- monocytes but not on CD14+CD16++ monocytes (P窶=窶0.004)  supported by CD163 mRNA levels. Incubation with M-CSF induced CD163 protein expression on CD14+CD16++ monocytes to the same extent as CD14++CD16- monocytes. CD163 expression on CD14++CD16+ monocytes from HIV-infected subjects was significantly higher than from uninfected individuals  with a trend towards increased expression on CD14++CD16- monocytes (P窶=窶0.019 and 0.069 respectively)  which is accounted for by HIV-1 therapy including protease inhibitors. Shedding of CD163 was shown to predominantly occur from the CD14++CD16- subset after Ficoll isolation and LPS stimulation. Soluble CD163 concentration in plasma from HIV-1 infected donors was similar to HIV-1 uninfected donors. Monocyte CD163 expression in HIV-1 infected patients showed a complicated relationship with classical measures of disease progression.

328,54809,Performance characteristics of plasma amyloid-beta 40 and 42 assays.,Identifying biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk will be critical to effective AD prevention. Levels of circulating amyloid-beta (Abeta) 40 and 42 may be candidate biomarkers. However  properties of plasma Abeta assays must be established. Using five different protocols  blinded samples were used to assess: intra-assay reproducibility; impact of EDTA vs. heparin anticoagulant tubes; and effect of time-to-blood processing. In addition  percent recovery of known Abeta concentrations in spiked samples was assessed. Median intra-assay coefficients of variation for the assay protocols ranged from 6-24% for Abeta(40)  and 8-14% for Abeta(42). There were no systematic differences in reproducibility by collection method. Plasma concentrations of Abeta (particularly Abeta(42) appeared stable in whole blood kept in ice packs and processed as long as 24 hours after collection. Recovery of expected concentrations was modest  ranging from -24% to 44% recovery of Abeta(40)  and 17% to 61% of Abeta(42). In conclusion  across five protocols  plasma Abeta(40) and Abeta(42) levels were measured with generally low error  and measurements appeared similar in blood collected in EDTA versus heparin. While these preliminary findings suggest that measuring plasma Abeta(40) and Abeta(42) may be feasible in varied research settings  additional work in this area is necessary.,0,Performance characteristics of plasma amyloid-beta 40 and 42 assays.Identifying biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk will be critical to effective AD prevention.

As an in vitro model for studying interactions between Zn(2+) and the Abeta peptide  that is the main component of plaques  the N- and C-termini protected Abeta(1-16) fragment has been chosen because reliable spectroscopic studies in water solution are possible due to the low propensity for oligomerization at pH approximately 6.5  and because all the Zn binding sites of Abeta have been identified in the 1-16 region. In this work we present the results of first principle simulations of several initial models of Zn-Abeta(1-16) complexes. The NMR results about the same system  where His 6  13  14 and Glu 11 side-chains coordinate the Zn ion  are strongly supported by these models. Coordination of Asp 1 to Zn drives the complex towards the expulsion of one of initially bonded His side-chains. Coordination of Tyr 10 to Zn is possible only when Tyr 10 is deprotonated.

Vorinostat is a histone deacetylase inhibitor that has radiosensitizing properties. The goal of this phase I study was to determine the MTDs of vorinostat and MIBG in combination. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Patients 竕､ 30 years with relapsed/refractory MIBG-avid neuroblastoma were eligible. Patients received oral vorinostat (dose levels 180 and 230 mg/m(2)) daily days 1 to 14. MIBG (dose levels 8  12  15  and 18 mCi/kg) was given on day 3 and peripheral blood stem cells on day 17. Alternating dose escalation of vorinostat and MIBG was performed using a 3+3 design. RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients enrolled to six dose levels  with 23 evaluable for dose escalation. No dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) were seen in the first three dose levels. At dose level 4 (15 mCi/kg MIBG/230 mg/m(2) vorinostat)  1 of 6 patients had DLT with grade 4 hypokalemia. At dose level 5 (18 mCi/kg MIBG/230 mg/m(2) vorinostat)  2 patients had dose-limiting bleeding (one grade 3 and one grade 5). At dose level 5a (18 mCi/kg MIBG/180 mg/m(2) vorinostat)  0 of 6 patients had DLT. The most common toxicities were neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. The response rate was 12% across all dose levels and 17% at dose level 5a. Histone acetylation increased from baseline in peripheral blood mononuclear cells collected on days 3 and 12 to 14.

Therefore, alternative noninvasive methods of evaluating or predicting mucosal status have been eagerly desired. For this purpose, blood, fecal, and radiologic modalities have been suggested and examined. C-reactive protein and fecal markers such as fecal calprotectin can evaluate active inflammation to some extent in both UC and CD.

Method(s): In this observational study, we collected clinical data from patients referred to our institution with histologically confirmed diagnosis of solid cancer and COVID-19 from Feb 1 to May 20,2020. COVID-19 diagnosis was laboratory or radiologically confirmed or clinically suspected for suggestive symptoms, including fever (>37,5degreeC) and/or respiratory tract symptoms. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to explore the risk factors associated with severe events defined as hospitalisation, admission to an intensive care unit, mechanical ventilation or death.

Visiting restrictions introduced since the start of the pandemic in residential care facilities (RCFs) may impact negatively on visitors including close family, friends and guardians. We examined the effects of COVID-19 visiting restrictions on measures of perceived loneliness, well-being and carer quality of life (QoL) amongst visitors of residents with and without cognitive impairment (CI) in Irish RCFs. Methods: We created a cross-sectional online survey. Loneliness was measured with the UCLA brief loneliness scale, psychological well-being with the WHO-5 Well-being Index and carer QoL with the Adult Carer QoL Questionnaire (support for caring subscale). Satisfaction with care (â€˜increased/sameâ€™ and â€˜decreasedâ€™) was measured. A history of CI was reported by respondents. Sampling was by convenience with the link circulated through university mail lists and targeted social media accounts for two weeks in June 2020. Results: In all, 225 responses were included of which 202 noted whether residents had reported CI. Most of the 202 identified themselves as immediate family (91%) and as female (82%). The majority (67%) were aged between 45-64 years. Most (80%) reported that their resident had CI. Approximately one-third indicated reduced satisfaction (27%) or that restrictions had impaired communication with nursing home staff (38%). Median loneliness scores were 4/9, well-being scores 60/100 and carer QoL scores 10/15.

The most marked WMDs were for neutrophils (ANC) at 3.82x109 /L (2.76, 4.87), lymphocytes (ALC) at -0.34x109 /L (-0.45, -0.23), interleukin-6 (IL-6) at 32.59pg/mL (23.99, 41.19), ferritin at 814.14ng/mL (551.48, 1076.81), C-reactive protein (CRP) at 66.11mg/L (52.16, 80.06), Ddimer at 5.74mg/L (3.91, 7.58), LDH at 232.41U/L (178.31, 286.52), and high sensitivity troponin I at 90.47pg/mL (47.79, 133.14) when comparing fatal to non-fatal cases. Similar trends were observed comparing severe to non-severe groups. There were no statistically significant associations between age or sex and WMD for any of the markers included in the meta-regression. The results highlight that hyperinflammation, blunted adaptive immune response, and intravascular coagulation play key roles in the pathogenesis of COVID-19. Markers of these processes are good candidates to identify patients for early intervention and, importantly, are likely reliable regardless of age or sex in adult patients.

Method and materials In a prospective diagnostic performance study from January 2009 to December 2013, patients under 60 presenting with acute abdominal pain, that required imaging following surgical review, were imaged with T2 HASTE MR. Rapid acquisition HASTE (Half Fourier Acquisition Single Shot Turbo Spin Echo) coronal and axial sequences were obtained, without intravenous contrast. Patients were followed up clinically for a minimum of 3 months. Results 468 cases included in the study. 349 were negative for acute abdominal pathology, 116 positive for acute abdominal pathology and 3 were indeterminate. In the MR positive group (n = 116), 64 had surgery confirming findings (34 appendicitis, 14 SBO, 3 ovarian torsion, 3 LBO, intussusception, ovarian carcinoma, ovarian dermoid, 2 pelvic inflammatory disease, diverticular abscess, crohns, 4 endoscopy for acute bowel pathology) while 51 were managed conservatively with concordant follow up (4 SBO, 11 diverticulitis, 6 pelvic inflammatory disease, 7 inflammatory bowel disease, 7 colitis, 6 pyelonephritis, 2 cholecystitis, renal abscess, pseudomembranous colitis, splenic haematoma, mesenteric adenitis, 2 pancreatitis, lymphoma, epiploic appendagitis). 1 patient had an MR diagnosis of appendicitis but at laparoscopy a sigmoid diverticular perforation was diagnosed and the appendix was normal. In the MR negative group (n = 349), 324 had uneventful follow-up, 22 had negative laparoscopies, while 3 had subsequent appendectomies, with appendicitis on histology (3 days, 10 days and 2 months post scan). In the MR indeterminate group (n = 3), one was treated conservatively with uneventful follow up, one had laparoscopic appendectomy with normal appendix on histology, one had laparoscopic appendectomy with acute appendicitis on histology. When MR correlated with clinical follow up (n = 468), overall diagnostic accuracy is 99% (463/468). When MR findings correlated with direct visualisation at surgery/endoscopy (n = 90), sensitivity is 98% (95% CI) and specificity is 92% (95% CI). Conclusion This study demonstrates that rapid acquisition axial and coronal T2 HASTE MR is a practical, safe and effective method in the diagnosis of acute abdominal pain.

The Food and Drug Administration has recently authorized the first antibody-based test for COVID-19; however, RT-PCR of nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swabs remains the recommended test for diagnosis. We present the first report of a false positive COVID-19 antibody test in a case of Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (GPA). Specifically, the case concerns an 82-year-old female, never smoker, who was admitted to our hospital with symptoms of fever and general fatigue that had lasted 7 days. She already had a positive IgM test for COVID-19, yet multiple RT-PCR tests had returned as negative for SARS-CoV-2. In the following days, her renal function deteriorated, while hematuria and proteinuria with active urinary sediment developed. Based on high clinical suspicion for ANCA-associated vasculitis, we performed a complete immunologic profile which revealed positive c-ANCA with elevated titers of anti-PR3. Pulses of methylprednisolone along with cyclophosphamide were applied. At day 10, treatment response was noticed as indicated by respiratory and renal function improvement.

There are varying data regarding the exact frequency in the various study population. The outcome of the olfactory impairment is also not clearly defined. OBJECTIVE: To find the frequency of olfactory impairment and its outcome in hospitalized patients with positive swab test for COVID-19. METHODS: This is a prospective descriptive study of 100 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, randomly sampled, from February to March 2020. Demographics, comorbidities, and laboratory findings were analyzed according to the olfactory loss or sinonasal symptoms. The olfactory impairment and sinonasal symptoms were evaluated by 9 Likert scale questions asked from the patients. RESULTS: Ninety-two patients completed the follow-up (means 20.1 (+/- 7.42) days). Twenty-two (23.91%) patients complained of olfactory loss and in 6 (6.52%) patients olfactory loss was the first symptom of the disease. The olfactory loss was reported to be completely resolved in all but one patient. Thirty-nine (42.39%) patients had notable sinonasal symptoms while rhinorrhea was the first symptom in 3 (3.26%). Fifteen patients (16.3%) had a taste impairment. Patients with sinonasal symptoms had a lower age (p = 0.01).

347,4944,Coronavirus discovery by metagenomic sequencing: a tool for pandemic preparedness,"INTRODUCTION: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic of 2020 is a prime example of the omnipresent threat of emerging viruses that can infect humans. A protocol for the identification of novel coronaviruses by viral metagenomic sequencing in diagnostic laboratories may contribute to pandemic preparedness. AIM: The aim of this study is to validate a metagenomic virus discovery protocol as a tool for coronavirus pandemic preparedness. METHODS: The performance of a viral metagenomic protocol in a clinical setting for the identification of novel coronaviruses was tested using clinical samples containing SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV, in combination with databases generated to contain only viruses of before the discovery dates of these coronaviruses, to mimic virus discovery. RESULTS: Classification of NGS reads using Centrifuge and Genome Detective resulted in assignment of the reads to the closest relatives of the emerging coronaviruses. Low nucleotide and amino acid identity (81% and 84%, respectively, for SARS-CoV-2) in combination with up to 98% genome coverage were indicative for a related, novel coronavirus. Capture probes targeting vertebrate viruses, designed in 2015, enhanced both sequencing depth and coverage of the SARS-CoV-2 genome, the latter increasing from 71% to 98%. CONCLUSION: The model used for simulation of virus discovery enabled validation of the metagenomic sequencing protocol. The metagenomic protocol with virus probes designed before the pandemic, can assist the detection and identification of novel coronaviruses directly in clinical samples.

Capture probes targeting vertebrate viruses, designed in 2015, enhanced both sequencing depth and coverage of the SARS-CoV-2 genome, the latter increasing from 71% to 98%. CONCLUSION: The model used for simulation of virus discovery enabled validation of the metagenomic sequencing protocol. The metagenomic protocol with virus probes designed before the pandemic, can assist the detection and identification of novel coronaviruses directly in clinical samples.

353,67548,[11C]metomidate positron emission tomography of adrenocortical tumors in correlation with histopathological findings,Context: Adrenal incidentalomas are common findings necessitating extensive laboratory work-up and repetitive radiological examinations. Positron emission tomography (PET) using 11C-labeled metomidate (MTO) has previously been described as a tool for specific adrenocortical imaging. Objective: We evaluated 212 MTO-PET examinations in 173 patients to identify its role in the management of adrenal tumors. Design: Seventy-five histopathological examinations from 73 patients were retrospectively analyzed. Setting: All examinations were performed at a referral center. Patients: Patients who were operated or biopsied due to adrenal tumors had histopathological diagnoses of adrenocortical adenoma (n = 26)  adrenocortical cancer (ACC; n = 13)  adrenocortical hyperplasia (n = 8)  pheochromocytoma (n = 6)  metastasis (n = 3)  and tumors of nonadrenal origin (n = 19). Main Outcome Measures: The main outcome measures were statistical analyses and findings while scrutinizing images. The hypothesis that MTO-PET is of value in the management of adrenal tumors  especially incidentaloma  was stated before data collection. Results: Sensitivity was 0.89 and specificity was 0.96 for MTO-PET in proving adrenocortical origin of the lesions. Pheochromocytomas  metastases to the adrenal gland  and nonadrenal masses were all MTO negative. PET measurements using standardized uptake values (SUV) in pathological adrenocortical tissue could differentiate lesions larger than 1-1.5 cm from normal adrenocortical tissue. SUV was higher in aldosterone-hypersecreting adenomas  and the SUV ratio between the tumor and the contralateral gland was significantly higher in all hormonally hypersecreting adenomas as well as in ACC. Conclusion: MTO-PET is a specific and sensitive method for diagnosing adrenocortical tumors. MTO-PET is useful in the imaging work-up of adrenal incidentalomas and may be beneficial for the examination of patients with primary aldosteronism or ACC.

The purpose of this study was to assess the clinical features and CT manifestations of COVID-19 by comparing patients with COVID-19 pneumonia with patients with non-COVID-19 pneumonia who presented at a fever observation department in Shanghai, China. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Patients were retrospectively enrolled in the study from January 19 through February 6, 2020. All patients underwent real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing. RESULTS. Eleven patients had RT-PCR test results that were positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, whereas 22 patients had negative results. No statistical difference in clinical features was observed (p > 0.05), with the exception of leukocyte and platelet counts (p < 0.05). The mean (+/- SD) interval between onset of symptoms and admission to the fever observation department was 4.40 +/- 2.00 and 5.52 +/- 4.00 days for patients with positive and negative RT-PCR test results, respectively. The frequency of opacifications in patients with positive results and patients with negative results, respectively, was as follows: Ground-glass opacities (GGOs), 100.0% versus 90.9%; mixed GGO, 63.6% versus 72.7%; and consolidation, 54.5% versus 77.3%. In patients with positive RT-PCR results, GGOs were the most commonly observed opacification (seen in 100.0% of patients) and were predominantly located in the peripheral zone (100.0% of patients), compared with patients with negative results (31.8%) (p = 0.05).

Brain (18)F-FDG-PET and volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were performed on 14 AD patients and 18 age-matched controls. Images were subjected to ROVER analysis  and voxel-based analysis using SPM5. Volumes by ROVER were 35% lower than MRI volumes in AD patients (as hypometabolic regions were excluded in ROVER-derived volume measurement ) while average ROVER- and MRI-derived cortical volumes were nearly identical in control population. Whole brain volumes when ROVER-derived and whole brain metabolic volumetric products (MVP) were significantly lower in AD and accurately distinguished AD patients from controls (Area Under the Curve (AUC) of Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) curves 0.89 and 0.86  respectively). This diagnostic accuracy was similar to voxel-based analyses. Analysis by ROVER of (18)F-FDG-PET images provides a unique index of metabolically-active brain volume  and can accurately distinguish between AD patients and controls as a proof of concept.

MRs were of transient type and confirmed from 7.5 +/- 1.6 (mean +/- standard deviation) to 13.1 +/- 6.5 days after the onset of the disease. Both types of valvular regurgitation were mild. The direction of regurgitation was from the center of valvular coaptation toward the posterior wall of the atrium. Neither valvular prolapse nor valvular deformity was noted. In patients with MR  left ventricular ejection fraction on M-mode echocardiography was significantly lower in the acute phase than in the convalescent phase of the disease (p less than 0.05). Using gallium-67 scintigram  the positive uptake of the isotope was noted in 7 (88%) of 8 patients with MR  but not found at all in 8 patients free of MR. These results suggest that MR and TR are often transient in the acute phase of Kawasaki disease and could be attributed to myocarditis.,0,Tricuspid and mitral regurgitation detected by color flow Doppler in the acute phase of Kawasaki diseaseValvular lesions in the acute phase of Kawasaki disease were studied in 19 children.

363,41907,"Balancing revenue generation with capacity generation: Case distribution, financial impact and hospital capacity changes from cancelling or resuming elective surgeries in the US during COVID-19","BACKGROUND: To increase bed capacity and resources, hospitals have postponed elective surgeries, although the financial impact of this decision is unknown. We sought to report elective surgical case distribution, associated gross hospital earnings and regional hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) bed capacity as elective surgical cases are cancelled and then resumed under simulated trends of COVID-19 incidence. METHODS: A retrospective, cohort analysis was performed using insurance claims from 161 million enrollees from the MarketScan database from January 1, 2008 to December 31, 2017. COVID-19 cases were calculated using a generalized Richards model. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) reports on the number of hospitalized and intensive care patients by age were used to estimate the number of cases seen in the ICU, the reduction in elective surgeries and the financial impact of this from historic claims data, using a denominator of all inpatient revenue and outpatient surgeries. RESULTS: Assuming 5% infection prevalence, cancelling all elective procedures decreases ICU overcapacity from 340% to 270%, but these elective surgical cases contribute 78% (IQR 74, 80) (1.1 trillion (T) US dollars) to inpatient hospital plus outpatient surgical gross earnings per year. Musculoskeletal, circulatory and digestive category elective surgical cases compose 33% ($447B) of total revenue. CONCLUSIONS: Procedures involving the musculoskeletal, cardiovascular and digestive system account for the largest loss of hospital gross earnings when elective surgery is postponed.

364,36286,Selective translational control of the Alzheimer amyloid precursor protein transcript by iron regulatory protein-1.,Iron influx increases the translation of the Alzheimer amyloid precursor protein (APP) via an iron-responsive element (IRE) RNA stem loop in its 5'-untranslated region. Equal modulated interaction of the iron regulatory proteins (IRP1 and IRP2) with canonical IREs controls iron-dependent translation of the ferritin subunits. However  our immunoprecipitation RT-PCR and RNA binding experiments demonstrated that IRP1  but not IRP2  selectively bound the APP IRE in human neural cells. This selective IRP1 interaction pattern was evident in human brain and blood tissue from normal and Alzheimer disease patients. We computer-predicted an optimal novel RNA stem loop structure for the human  rhesus monkey  and mouse APP IREs with reference to the canonical ferritin IREs but also the IREs encoded by erythroid heme biosynthetic aminolevulinate synthase and Hif-2ﾎｱ mRNAs  which preferentially bind IRP1. Selective 2'-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension analysis was consistent with a 13-base single-stranded terminal loop and a conserved GC-rich stem. Biotinylated RNA probes deleted of the conserved CAGA motif in the terminal loop did not bind to IRP1 relative to wild type probes and could no longer base pair to form a predicted AGA triloop. An AGU pseudo-triloop is key for IRP1 binding to the canonical ferritin IREs. RNA probes encoding the APP IRE stem loop exhibited the same high affinity binding to rhIRP1 as occurs for the H-ferritin IRE (35 pm). Intracellular iron chelation increased binding of IRP1 to the APP IRE  decreasing intracellular APP expression in SH-SY5Y cells.

365,39414,Association between SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies and commercial serological assays,"INTRODUCTION: Commercially available SARS-CoV-2 serological assays based on different viral antigens have been approved for the qualitative determination of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. However, there are limited published data associating the results from commercial assays with neutralizing antibodies. METHODS: 67 specimens from 48 patients with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 and a positive result by the Roche Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2, Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG, or EUROIMMUN SARS-CoV-2 IgG assays and 5 control specimens were analyzed for the presence of neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Correlation, concordance, positive percent agreement (PPA), and negative percent agreement (NPA) were calculated at several cutoffs. Results were compared in patients categorized by clinical outcomes. RESULTS: The correlation between SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing titer (EC50) and the Roche, Abbott, and EUROIMMUN assays was 0.29, 0.47, and 0.46 respectively. At an EC50 of 1:32, the concordance kappa with Roche was 0.49 (95% CI; 0.23-0.75), with Abbott was 0.52 (0.28-0.77), and with EUROIMMUN was 0.61 (0.4-0.82). At the same neutralizing titer, the PPA and NPA for the Roche was 100% (94-100) & 56% (30-80); Abbott was 96% (88-99) & 69% (44-86); and EUROIMMUN was 91% (80-96) & 81% (57-93) for distinguishing neutralizing antibodies. Patients who were intubated, had cardiac injury, or acute kidney injury from COVID-19 infection had higher neutralizing titers relative to those with mild symptoms. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 patients generate an antibody response to multiple viral proteins such that the calibrator ratios on the Roche, Abbott, and EUROIMMUN assays are all associated with SARS-CoV-2 neutralization. Nevertheless, commercial serological assays have poor NPA for SARS-CoV-2 neutralization, making them imperfect proxies for neutralization.

As healthcare workers (HCW) are one of the groups hardest hit by the infection, it is important to know the seroprevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in pediatric departments. We performed 175 immunoglobulin (Ig)M and IgG immunochromatographic rapid tests in the personnel working at the Pediatric Department of the Hospital Clinico Universitario of Santiago de Compostela (Spain), including pediatricians, residents, nurses, and other staff, on days 31-33 since the lockdown started. Seven out of the 175 tests were positive, including four for IgM and three for IgG, leading to a seroprevalence of 4.0% (95% CI: 1.1-6.9%). Only one of them had symptoms at the time of testing (sore throat). All seropositive cases yielded negative RT-PCR of the upper and lower respiratory tract. This is the first SARS-CoV-2 serological survey among HCWs reported in Spain. Notwithstanding the test limitations, our results reveal that personal protection policy and lockdown measures have been effective to limit population exposure.

In vivo quantification of subregional atrophy  such as changes in cortical thickness or structure volume  could lead to improved diagnosis and better assessment of the neuroprotective effects of a therapy. Toward this end  we have developed a fast and robust method for accurately quantifying cerebral structural changes in several cortical and subcortical regions using serial MRI scans. In 169 healthy controls  299 subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI)  and 129 subjects with AD  we measured rates of subregional cerebral volume change for each cohort and performed power calculations to identify regions that would provide the most sensitive outcome measures in clinical trials of disease-modifying agents. Consistent with regional specificity of AD  temporal-lobe cortical regions showed the greatest disease-related changes and significantly outperformed any of the clinical or cognitive measures examined for both AD and MCI. Global measures of change in brain structure  including whole-brain and ventricular volumes  were also elevated in AD and MCI  but were less salient when compared to changes in normal subjects. Therefore  these biomarkers are less powerful for quantifying disease-modifying effects of compounds that target AD pathology. The findings indicate that regional temporal lobe cortical changes would have great utility as outcome measures in clinical trials and may also have utility in clinical practice for aiding early diagnosis of neurodegenerative disease.,0,Subregional neuroanatomical change as a biomarker for Alzheimer's disease.Regions of the temporal and parietal lobes are particularly damaged in Alzheimer's disease (AD)  and this leads to a predictable pattern of brain atrophy.

369,40752,Dementia with Lewy Bodies is associated with higher scores on the Geriatric Depression Scale than is Alzheimer's disease,Background: Several reports suggest a higher morbidity of depression in patients with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) than in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). However  these results have not been duplicated consistently. The psychiatric symptoms of dementia  including depression  are important for its diagnosis and management. Thus  the aim of the present study was to clarify the characteristics of the depressive symptoms in DLB compared with AD using the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). Methods: We examined the GDS score for 86 patients with probable DLB (based on the Consensus Criteria for the clinical diagnosis of DLB) and 86 patients with probable AD (based on criteria of the National Institute for Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke-Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association)  who were matched according to age  sex  education  and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores. We also examined correlations between GDS scores and age  sex  or MMSE scores in both groups. Correlations between GDS scores and metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scintigraphy were examined in patients with DLB. To characterize the GDS in DLB  its profile was examined using factor structures. Results: Scores for DLB patients were twice as high on the GDS as those for AD patients. There was no correlation between GDS score and age  sex  or MMSE scores in either group. Furthermore  there was no correlation between the results of MIBG scintigraphy and GDS scores in the DLB group. Using factor structures  the depression symptom profile of these diseases suggested that depression-specific symptoms  such as mood  worry  or future outlook  were more frequent in the DLB group than non-specific symptoms  such as lack of energy  decreased concentration  or apathy. Conclusions: The data suggest that depressive symptoms are highly specific symptoms of DLB  independent of other features of this disorder.

We undertook this study to assess the utility of FDG-PET in the differential diagnosis of dementia subtypes. One hundred and twenty-five patients diagnosed with dementia were referred from cognitive disorders and memory clinics of speciality neurology centres for the FDG-PET study. Imaging-based diagnosis of dementia type was established in 101 patients by visual assessment of individual scans by a PET physician blinded to the clinical diagnosis. The results were compared with an 18-month follow-up clinical assessment made by the specialist neurologist. Concordance of visual evaluation of FDG-PET scans with clinical diagnosis of the dementia type was achieved in 90% of patients scanned. This concordance was 93.4% for AD  88.8% for FTD  66.6% for DLBD and 92.3% for the other dementia syndromes.

374,25604,"Diurnal fluctuation in histidine decarboxylase expression, the rate limiting enzyme for histamine production, and its disorder in neurodegenerative diseases.",STUDY OBJECTIVES: Neuronal histamine shows diurnal rhythms in rodents and plays a major role in the maintenance of vigilance. No data are available on its diurnal fluctuation in humans  either in health or in neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson disease (PD)  Alzheimer disease (AD)  or Huntington disease (HD)  all of which are characterized by sleep-wake disturbances. DESIGN: Quantitative in situ hybridization was used to study the mRNA expression of histidine decarboxylase (HDC)  the key enzyme of histamine production in the tuberomammillary nucleus (TMN) in postmortem human hypothalamic tissue  obtained from 33 controls and 31 patients with a neurodegenerative disease-PD (n = 15)  AD (n = 9)  and HD (n = 8)-and covering the full 24-h cycle with respect to clock time of death. RESULTS: HDC-mRNA levels in controls were found to be significantly higher during the daytime than at night (e.g.  08:01-20:00 versus 20:01-08:00  P = 0.004). This day-night fluctuation was markedly different in patients with neurodegenerative diseases. CONCLUSION: The diurnal fluctuation of HDC-mRNA expression in human TMN supports a role for neuronal histamine in regulating day-night rhythms. Future studies should investigate histamine rhythm abnormalities in neurodegenerative disorders. CITATION: Shan L; Hofman MA; van Wamelen DJ; Van Someren EJW; Bao AM; Swaab DF.

Pooling samples for lower risk populations has the potential to accommodate increased demand for SARS-CoV-2 molecular testing. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility of 4-way pooling of SARS-CoV-2 specimens for high-throughput RT-PCR. STUDY DESIGN: Individual samples were pooled 1:4 through automated liquid handling, extracted, and assayed by our emergency use authorized CDC-based RT-PCR laboratory developed test. Positive samples were serially diluted and theoretical and empirical PCR cycle thresholds were evaluated. Thirty-two distinct positive samples were pooled into negative specimens and individual CTs were compared to pooled CTs. Low positive samples were repeated for reproducibility and 32 four-way pools of negative specimens were assayed to determine specificity. RESULTS: Four-way pooling was associated with a loss of sensitivity of 1.7 and 2.0 CTs for our N1 and N2 targets, respectively. Pooling correctly identified SARS-CoV-2 in 94 % (n = 30/32) of samples tested. The two low positive specimens (neat CT > 35) not detected by pooling were individually repeated and detected 75 % (n=6/8) and 37.5 % (n = 3/8) of the time, respectively. All specimens individually determined negative were also negative by pooling. CONCLUSION: We report that 1:4 pooling of samples is specific and associated with an expected 2 CT loss in analytical sensitivity.

386,21694,Autophagic-lysosomal perturbation enhances tau aggregation in transfectants with induced wild-type tau expression.,The intracellular assembly of tau aggregates is a pathological hallmark shared by Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders known collectively as tauopathies. To model how tau fibrillogenesis evolves in tauopathies  we previously established transfectant M1C cultures from human neuroblastoma BE(2)-M17D cells that inducibly express human tau. In the present study  these cells were used to determine the role of the autophagic-lysosomal system in the degradation and aggregation of wild-type tau. Tau induction for 5 days led to the accumulation of tau with nominal assembly of tau aggregates within cells. When the lysosomotropic agent  chloroquine (CQ)  was added following the termination of tau induction  tau clearance was delayed. Decreased tau truncation and increased levels of intact tau were observed. When present during tau induction  CQ led to tau accumulation and promoted the formation of sarkosyl-insoluble aggregates containing both truncated and full-length tau. CQ treatment significantly decreased the activities of cathepsins D  B and L  and the inhibition of cathepsins B and L mimicked the effect of CQ and increased tau levels in cells. Additionally  exposure of cells to the autophagy inhibitor  3-methyladenine  led to tau accumulation and aggregation. These results suggest that the autophagic-lysosomal system plays a role in the clearance of tau  and that dysfunction of this system results in the formation of tau oligomers and insoluble aggregates.,0,Autophagic-lysosomal perturbation enhances tau aggregation in transfectants with induced wild-type tau expression.The intracellular assembly of tau aggregates is a pathological hallmark shared by Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders known collectively as tauopathies. To model how tau fibrillogenesis evolves in tauopathies  we previously established transfectant M1C cultures from human neuroblastoma BE(2)-M17D cells that inducibly express human tau. In the present study  these cells were used to determine the role of the autophagic-lysosomal system in the degradation and aggregation of wild-type tau. Tau induction for 5 days led to the accumulation of tau with nominal assembly of tau aggregates within cells. When the lysosomotropic agent  chloroquine (CQ)  was added following the termination of tau induction  tau clearance was delayed. Decreased tau truncation and increased levels of intact tau were observed. When present during tau induction  CQ led to tau accumulation and promoted the formation of sarkosyl-insoluble aggregates containing both truncated and full-length tau.

Enhanced understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infection and pathogenesis is critical for the development of therapeutics. To reveal insight into viral replication, cell tropism, and host-viral interactions of SARS-CoV-2 we performed single-cell RNA sequencing of experimentally infected human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) in air-liquid interface cultures over a time-course. This revealed novel polyadenylated viral transcripts and highlighted ciliated cells as the major target of infection, which we confirmed by electron microscopy. Over the course of infection, cell tropism of SARS-CoV-2 expands to other epithelial cell types including basal and club cells. Infection induces cell intrinsic expression of type I and type III IFNs and IL6 but not IL1. This results in expression of interferon stimulated genes in both infected and bystander cells.

389,41351,Outcomes and biomarker analyses among patients with COVID-19 treated with interleukin 6 (IL-6) receptor antagonist sarilumab at a single institution in Italy,"BACKGROUND: The inflammatory pathology observed in severe COVID-19 disease caused by the 2019 novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is characterized by elevated serum levels of C reactive protein (CRP) and cytokines, including interferon gamma, interleukin 8 (IL-8), and interleukin 6 (IL-6). Initial reports from the outbreak in Italy, China and the USA have provided anecdotal evidence of improved outcomes with the administration of anti-IL-6 agents, and large-scale trials evaluating these therapies are ongoing. STUDY DESCRIPTION: In this retrospective case series, clinical outcomes and correlates of response to treatment with the IL-6 receptor antagonist sarilumab are described for 15 patients with COVID-19 from a single institution in Southern Italy. Among 10 patients whose symptoms improved after sarilumab treatment, rapid decreases in CRP levels corresponded with clinical improvement. Lower levels of IL-6 at baseline as well as lower neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio as compared with patients whose COVID-19 did not improve with treatment were associated with sarilumab-responsive disease. CONCLUSIONS: This observation may reflect a possible clinical benefit regarding early intervention with IL-6-modulatory therapies for COVID-19 and that CRP could be a potential biomarker of response to treatment.

Methods Secondary analysis of a multinational, cohort study on all consecutive pregnant women with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from February 1, 2020 to April 30, 2020 from 73 centers from 22 different countries. A confirmed case of COVID-19 was defined as a positive result on real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay of nasal and pharyngeal swab specimens. The primary outcome was a composite adverse fetal outcome, defined as the presence of either abortion (pregnancy loss before 22 weeks of gestations), stillbirth (intrauterine fetal death after 22 weeks of gestation), neonatal death (death of a live-born infant within the first 28 days of life), and perinatal death (either stillbirth or neonatal death). Logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate parameters independently associated with the primary outcome. Logistic regression was reported as odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). Results Mean gestational age at diagnosis was 30.6+/-9.5 weeks, with 8.0% of women being diagnosed in the first, 22.2% in the second and 69.8% in the third trimester of pregnancy. There were six miscarriage (2.3%), six intrauterine device (IUD) (2.3) and 5 (2.0%) neonatal deaths, with an overall rate of perinatal death of 4.2% (11/265), thus resulting into 17 cases experiencing and 226 not experiencing composite adverse fetal outcome. Neither stillbirths nor neonatal deaths had congenital anomalies found at antenatal or postnatal evaluation. Furthermore, none of the cases experiencing IUD had signs of impending demise at arterial or venous Doppler. Neonatal deaths were all considered as prematurity-related adverse events. Of the 250 live-born neonates, one (0.4%) was found positive at RT-PCR pharyngeal swabs performed after delivery. The mother was tested positive during the third trimester of pregnancy. The newborn was asymptomatic and had negative RT-PCR test after 14 days of life. At logistic regression analysis, gestational age at diagnosis (OR: 0.85, 95% CI 0.8-0.9 per week increase; p<0.001), birthweight (OR: 1.17, 95% CI 1.09-1.12.7 per 100 g decrease; p=0.012) and maternal ventilatory support, including either need for oxygen or CPAP (OR: 4.12, 95% CI 2.3-7.9; p=0.001) were independently associated with composite adverse fetal outcome.

The aim was to evaluate the routine blood tests for diagnosis of COVID-19, determining the diagnostic accuracy of blood biomarkers to differentiate between patients with and without COVID-19. METHODS: Clinical charts, nursing records, laboratory findings, and chest x-rays from adult patients with clinical suspicion of COVID-19 (fever, cough and/or dyspnea) at hospital admission were reviewed. Patients were classified into two groups according to RT-PCR COVID-19: positive (COVID-19) or negative (NON-COVID-19). Diagnostic accuracy was determined by analyzing receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, calculating the area under the ROC curve (AUC) and the cutoff value. In order to reduce the number of false positives, the cutoff value with a specificity of 80% was considered. RESULTS: Two hundred three patients (101 females, 102 males) with ages between 18 and 96 years (mean = 61.3) were studied. Ninety-four were COVID-19 and 109 were NON-COVID-19. Plasma ferritin level was the most accurate biomarker (AUC = 0.847 and 0.804 in women and men, respectively). The following diagnostic criteria for suspected COVID-19 were established with biomarker cutoff values to differentiate between COVID-19 and NON-COVID-19 patients: lymphocytes <= 1.0 x 109/L; eosinophils <= 0.02 x 109/L; ferritin > 125% of upper reference limit (URL); LDH > 125% of URL; hsCRP > 80 mg/L; and D-dimer > 1.2 mg/L.

METHODS: We conducted a phase 1, dose-escalation, open-label trial of a messenger RNA vaccine, mRNA-1273, which encodes the stabilized prefusion SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S-2P) in healthy adults. The trial was expanded to include 40 older adults, who were stratified according to age (56 to 70 years or >=71 years). All the participants were assigned sequentially to receive two doses of either 25 mug or 100 mug of vaccine administered 28 days apart. RESULTS: Solicited adverse events were predominantly mild or moderate in severity and most frequently included fatigue, chills, headache, myalgia, and pain at the injection site. Such adverse events were dose-dependent and were more common after the second immunization. Binding-antibody responses increased rapidly after the first immunization. By day 57, among the participants who received the 25-mug dose, the anti-S-2P geometric mean titer (GMT) was 323,945 among those between the ages of 56 and 70 years and 1,128,391 among those who were 71 years of age or older; among the participants who received the 100-mug dose, the GMT in the two age subgroups was 1,183,066 and 3,638,522, respectively. After the second immunization, serum neutralizing activity was detected in all the participants by multiple methods. Binding- and neutralizing-antibody responses appeared to be similar to those previously reported among vaccine recipients between the ages of 18 and 55 years and were above the median of a panel of controls who had donated convalescent serum. The vaccine elicited a strong CD4 cytokine response involving type 1 helper T cells. CONCLUSIONS: In this small study involving older adults, adverse events associated with the mRNA-1273 vaccine were mainly mild or moderate. The 100-mug dose induced higher binding- and neutralizing-antibody titers than the 25-mug dose, which supports the use of the 100-mug dose in a phase 3 vaccine trial.

The sensitivity of these risk markers has not been validated. Methods and results-: We examined patients enrolled in the International Registry of Acute Aortic Dissection from 1996 to 2009. The number of patients with confirmed acute aortic dissection who presented with 1 or more of 12 proposed clinical risk markers was determined. An aortic dissection detection (ADD) risk score of 0 to 3 was calculated on the basis of the number of risk categories (high-risk predisposing conditions  high-risk pain features  high-risk examination features) in which patients met criteria. The ADD risk score was tested for sensitivity. Of 2538 patients with acute aortic dissection  2430 (95.7%) were identified by 1 or more of 12 proposed clinical risk markers. With the use of the ADD risk score  108 patients (4.3%) were identified as low risk (ADD score 0)  927 patients (36.5%) were intermediate risk (ADD score 1)  and 1503 patients (59.2%) were high risk (ADD score 2 or 3).

Here we demonstrate redirection of amyloid fibril formation through the action of a small molecule  resulting in off-pathway  highly stable oligomers. The polyphenol (-)-epigallocatechin gallate efficiently inhibits the fibrillogenesis of both alpha-synuclein and amyloid-beta by directly binding to the natively unfolded polypeptides and preventing their conversion into toxic  on-pathway aggregation intermediates. Instead of beta-sheet-rich amyloid  the formation of unstructured  nontoxic alpha-synuclein and amyloid-beta oligomers of a new type is promoted  suggesting a generic effect on aggregation pathways in neurodegenerative diseases.,0,"EGCG redirects amyloidogenic polypeptides into unstructured, off-pathway oligomers.The accumulation of beta-sheet-rich amyloid fibrils or aggregates is a complex  multistep process that is associated with cellular toxicity in a number of human protein misfolding disorders  including Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases.

399,46828,Hepatopancreatobiliary manifestations and complications associated with inflammatory bowel disease,"Diseases involving the hepatopancreatobiliary (HPB) system are frequently encountered in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Hepatobiliary manifestations constitute some of the most common extraintestinal manifestations of IBD. They appear to occur with similar frequency in patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. HPB manifestations may occur in following settings: 1) disease possibly associated with a shared pathogenetic mechanism with IBD including primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), small-duct PSC/pericholangitis and PSC/ autoimmune hepatitis overlap, acute and chronic pancreatitis related to IBD; 2) diseases which parallel structural and physiological changes seen with IBD, including cholelithiasis, portal vein thrombosis, and hepatic abscess; and 3) diseases related to adverse effects associated with treatment of IBD, including druginduced hepatitis, pancreatitis (purine-based agents), or liver cirrhosis (methotrexate), and reactivation of hepatitis B, and biologic agent-associated hepatosplenic lymphoma. Less common HPB manifestations that have been described in association with IBD include autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP), IgG4-associated cholangitis (IAC), primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), fatty liver, granulomatous hepatitis, and amyloidosis. PSC is the most significant hepatobiliary manifestation associated with IBD and poses substantial challenges in management requiring a multidisciplinary approach. The natural disease course of PSC may progress to cirrhosis and ultimately require liver transplantation in spite of total proctocolectomy with ileal-pouch anal anastomosis. The association between AIP, IAC, and elevated serum IgG4 in patients with PSC is intriguing. The recently reported association between IAC and IBD may open the door to investigate these complex disorders. Further studies are warranted to help understand the pathogenesis of HPB manifestations associated with IBD, which would help clinicians better manage these patients. An interdisciplinary approach, involving gastroenterologists, hepatologists, and, in advanced cases, general, colorectal, and transplant surgeons is advocated.

Hence, it is urgent and imperative to evaluate the risk of COVID-19 for as many global locations as possible. This study calculates the relative risk of the importation and exportation of the COVID-19 virus. The study's most important contribution is the calculation of the overall relative risk of the importation and exportation of COVID-19 from every airport in local municipalities around the world, based on global spatial and mapping information. Three scenarios of air travel restriction are considered, and the change in the risk of importation and exportation of COVID-19 is calculated. The relative risk of importation and exportation of COVID-19 clearly shows that not only China, Europe, Middle East, and East Asia, but also the U.S., Australia, and countries in northeast Asia and Latin America are subject to risk. Further, a larger reduction in air travel through airports in a large part of the cumulative incidence area would lead to a gradual decrease in the risk flow. Importantly, the exportation risk of the disease from some airports in China, Iran, and European countries has a higher global spread than the importation risk during the pandemic stage. Therefore, every airport, or government with airports in their jurisdiction, should implement strict countermeasures. It is also indispensable for these countries to undertake countermeasures for COVID-19, such as home quarantine within each country and restricting infected or suspected individuals from flying on airplanes.

METHODS: Enrollees underwent clinical evaluation to determine cognitive status and subsequent 18F FDG PET neuroimaging. Four blinded readers (2 novices and 2 experts) rated the images for degree of abnormality and interpretive confidence without and with 3D-SSP. Diagnostic accuracy was determined with area under the curve (area under the curve) of a receiver operating characteristic (receiver operating characteristic) curve analysis and change in confidence with model-based means (LSMeans). RESULTS: Twenty-three normal controls and 31 patients with cognitive impairment (18 MCI and 13 AD) were enrolled (28 female and 26 male; mean age 74 years). During follow-up (mean 3.6 years)  all normal participants remained normal  12 of 18 participants with MCI progressed to dementia  and all participants with baseline dementia progressed. The area under the curve with 3D-SSP (0.88; 95% CI: 0.76-0.95) was significantly higher than without it (0.72; 95% CI: 0.55-0.83). The specificity increased from 26% to 63% for novices and from 56% to 87% for experts with addition of 3D-SSP  whereas the sensitivity was essentially unchanged at 86% and 86% for the beginners and 81% and 79% for the experts.

405,10456,PIN-1 promoter polymorphisms in mild cognitive impairment and susceptibility to Alzheimer's disease: a preliminary report.,BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Peptydil prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PIN-1)  which specifically regulates the conformational changes following phosphorylation of several proteins  targets the inactive hyper-phosphorylated tau on the Thr231-Pro motif and directly restores its biological function. Interestingly  PIN-1 is oxidatively inhibited not only in Alzheimer's disease brain but also in the hippocampi of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects. The PIN-1 gene is characterized by two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the promoter region which are associated with the risk of Alzheimer's disease. The aim of this study was to analyse the genotype and allele distributions of these PIN-1 SNPs in MCI subjects diagnosed respectively as amnestic MCI (a-MCI) and multiple impaired cognitive domains (mcd-MCI) on the basis of cognitive features. METHODS: -667 T/C and -842 C/G SNPs were genotyped by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and direct sequencing in 43 MCI subjects  with the intention of comparing -667 and -842 SNP frequencies with those previously described in 111 Alzheimer's disease patients (AD) and 73 healthy controls (HC). RESULTS: The allele frequencies of the -842 C/G SNP in a-MCI subjects are similar to those of AD subjects  while those of mcd-MCI are comparable to HC (G allele 83% in both a-MCI and AD; 95% and 94% in mcd-MCI and HC  respectively). A similar trend is also observed in -842 C/G genotypes. CONCLUSIONS: Since a-MCI is thought to be the preclinical form of AD  the similar genotype distribution of -842 SNP in AD and a-MCI  but not in mcd-MCI  suggests that it is potentially involved in the conversion of a-MCI to AD. In conclusion  these findings support the theory that polymorphisms of the PIN-1 gene can affect neurodegeneration and its clinical progression.,0,PIN-1 promoter polymorphisms in mild cognitive impairment and susceptibility to Alzheimer's disease: a preliminary report.BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Peptydil prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PIN-1)  which specifically regulates the conformational changes following phosphorylation of several proteins  targets the inactive hyper-phosphorylated tau on the Thr231-Pro motif and directly restores its biological function.

406,51471,Google Trends Insights Into Reduced Acute Coronary Syndrome Admissions During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Infodemiology Study,"BACKGROUND: During the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, a reduction in the presentation of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) has been noted in several countries. However, whether these trends reflect a reduction in ACS incidence or a decrease in emergency room visits is unknown. Using Google Trends, queries for chest pain that have previously been shown to closely correlate with coronary heart disease were compared with searches for myocardial infarction and COVID-19 symptoms. OBJECTIVE: The current study evaluates if search terms (or topics) pertaining to chest pain symptoms correlate with the reported decrease in presentations of ACS. METHODS: Google Trends data for search terms ""chest pain,"" ""myocardial infarction,"" ""cough,"" and ""fever"" were obtained from June 1, 2019, to May 31, 2020. Related queries were evaluated for a relationship to coronary heart disease. RESULTS: Following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, chest pain searches increased in all countries studied by at least 34% (USA P=.003, Spain P=.007, UK P=.001, Italy P=.002), while searches for myocardial infarction dropped or remained unchanged. Rising searches for chest pain included ""coronavirus chest pain,"" ""home remedies for chest pain,"" and ""natural remedies for chest pain."" Searches on COVID-19 symptoms (eg, cough, fever) rose initially but returned to baseline while chest pain-related searches remained elevated throughout May. CONCLUSIONS: Search engine queries for chest pain have risen during the pandemic as have related searches with alternative attribution for chest pain or home care for chest pain, suggesting that recent drops in ACS presentations may be due to patients avoiding the emergency room and potential treatment in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Using Google Trends, queries for chest pain that have previously been shown to closely correlate with coronary heart disease were compared with searches for myocardial infarction and COVID-19 symptoms. OBJECTIVE: The current study evaluates if search terms (or topics) pertaining to chest pain symptoms correlate with the reported decrease in presentations of ACS. METHODS: Google Trends data for search terms ""chest pain,"" ""myocardial infarction,"" ""cough,"" and ""fever"" were obtained from June 1, 2019, to May 31, 2020. Related queries were evaluated for a relationship to coronary heart disease. RESULTS: Following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, chest pain searches increased in all countries studied by at least 34% (USA P=.003, Spain P=.007, UK P=.001, Italy P=.002), while searches for myocardial infarction dropped or remained unchanged. Rising searches for chest pain included ""coronavirus chest pain,"" ""home remedies for chest pain,"" and ""natural remedies for chest pain."" Searches on COVID-19 symptoms (eg, cough, fever) rose initially but returned to baseline while chest pain-related searches remained elevated throughout May. CONCLUSIONS: Search engine queries for chest pain have risen during the pandemic as have related searches with alternative attribution for chest pain or home care for chest pain, suggesting that recent drops in ACS presentations may be due to patients avoiding the emergency room and potential treatment in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.

408,39496,Oxidative modification of lipoic acid by HNE in Alzheimer disease brain.,Alzheimer disease (AD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disease characterized by the presence of three pathological hallmarks: synapse loss  extracellular senile plaques (SP) and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). The major component of SP is amyloid ﾎｲ-peptide (Aﾎｲ)  which has been shown to induce oxidative stress. The AD brain shows increased levels of lipid peroxidation products  including 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE). HNE can react covalently with Cys  His  or Lys residues on proteins  altering structure and function of the latter. In the present study we measured the levels of the HNE-modified lipoic acid in brain of subjects with AD and age-matched controls. Lipoic acid is a key co-factor for a number of proteins including pyruvate dehydrogenase and ﾎｱ-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase  key complexes for cellular energetics. We observed a significant decrease in the levels of HNE-lipoic acid in the AD brain compared to that of age-matched controls. To investigate this phenomenon further  the levels and activity of lipoamide dehydrogenase (LADH) were measured in AD and control brains. Additionally  LADH activities were measured after in-vitro HNE-treatment to mice brains. Both LADH levels and activities were found to be significantly reduced in AD brain compared to age-matched control. HNE-treatment also reduced the LADH activity in mice brain. These data are consistent with a two-hit hypothesis of AD: oxidative stress leads to lipid peroxidation that  in turn  causes oxidative dysfunction of key energy-related complexes in mitochondria  triggering neurodegeneration. This study is consonant with the notion that lipoic acid supplementation could be a potential treatment for the observed loss of cellular energetics in AD and potentiate the antioxidant defense system to prevent or delay the oxidative stress in and progression of this devastating dementing disorder.,0,Oxidative modification of lipoic acid by HNE in Alzheimer disease brain.Alzheimer disease (AD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disease characterized by the presence of three pathological hallmarks: synapse loss  extracellular senile plaques (SP) and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs).

411,37985,Pivotal role of RanBP9 in integrin-dependent focal adhesion signaling and assembly.,Accumulation of the amyloid ﾎｲ (Aﾎｲ) peptide derived from the amyloid precursor protein (APP) plays a central role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We previously reported that the scaffolding protein RanBP9 is markedly increased in AD brains and promotes Aﾎｲ generation by scaffolding APP/BACE1/LRP complexes together and accelerating APP endocytosis. Because APP  LRP  and RanBP9 all physically interact with ﾎｲ-integrins  we investigated whether RanBP9 alters integrin-dependent cell adhesion and focal adhesion signaling. Here  we show that RanBP9 overexpression dramatically disrupts integrin-dependent cell attachment and spreading in NIH3T3 and hippocampus-derived HT22 cells  concomitant with strongly decreased Pyk2/paxillin signaling and talin/vinculin localization in focal adhesion complexes. Conversely  RanBP9 knockdown robustly promotes cell attachment  spreading  and focal adhesion signaling and assembly. Cell surface biotinylation and endocytosis assays reveal that RanBP9 overexpression and RanBP9 siRNA potently reduces and increases surface ﾎｲ1-integrin and LRP by accelerating and inhibiting their endocytosis  respectively. Primary hippocampal neurons derived from RanBP9-transgenic mice also demonstrate severely reduced levels of surface ﾎｲ1-integrin  LRP  and APP  as well as neurite arborization. Therefore  these data indicate that RanBP9 simultaneously inhibits cell-adhesive processes and enhances Aﾎｲ generation by accelerating APP  LRP  and ﾎｲ1-integrin endocytosis.,0,Pivotal role of RanBP9 in integrin-dependent focal adhesion signaling and assembly.Accumulation of the amyloid ﾎｲ (Aﾎｲ) peptide derived from the amyloid precursor protein (APP) plays a central role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD).

412,67139,Imaging Volume Trends and Recovery During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Comparative Analysis Between a Large Urban Academic Hospital and Its Affiliated Imaging Centers,"RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: While affiliated imaging centers play an important role in healthcare systems, little is known of how their operations are impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Our goal was to investigate imaging volume trends during the pandemic at our large academic hospital compared to the affiliated imaging centers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a descriptive retrospective study of imaging volume from an academic hospital (main hospital campus) and its affiliated imaging centers from January 1 through May 21, 2020. Imaging volume assessment was separated into prestate of emergency (SOE) period (before SOE in Massachusetts on March 10, 2020), ""post-SOE"" period (time after ""nonessential"" services closure on March 24, 2020), and ""transition"" period (between pre-SOE and post-SOE). RESULTS: Imaging volume began to decrease on March 11, 2020, after hospital policy to delay nonessential studies. The average weekly imaging volume during the post-SOE period declined by 54% at the main hospital campus and 64% at the affiliated imaging centers. The rate of imaging volume recovery was slower for affiliated imaging centers (slope=6.95 for weekdays) compared to main hospital campus (slope=7.18 for weekdays). CT, radiography, and ultrasound exhibited the lowest volume loss, with weekly volume decrease of 41%, 49%, and 53%, respectively, at the main hospital campus, and 43%, 61%, and 60%, respectively, at affiliated imaging centers. Mammography had the greatest volume loss of 92% at both the main hospital campus and affiliated imaging centers. CONCLUSION: Affiliated imaging center volume decreased to a greater degree than the main hospital campus and showed a slower rate of recovery. Furthermore, the trend in imaging volume and recovery were temporally related to public health announcements and COVID-19 cases. Copyright Â© 2020 The Association of University Radiologists.

417,41708,Significance of liver dysfunction associated with decreased hepatic CT attenuation values in Japanese patients with severe COVID-19,"Background: COVID-19 has emerged as a threat to human health. Liver dysfunction has been reported to occur frequently in patients with COVID-19, although its significance has not yet been elucidated. Method(s): The subjects were 35 patients with COVID-19, and clinical characteristics were retrospectively analyzed. COVID-19 patients requiring ventilator were classified as having severe COVID-19. Result(s): All 35 patients were diagnosed as having mild-to-moderate COVID-19 at admission, but the severity aggravated to severe in 8 patients (22.9%) in hospital. Hepatocellular-type liver injury, defined as elevation of the serum AST and/or ALT levels to >= 3 times the ULN, was seen in 2 patients (5.7%), and cholestasis-type liver injury, defined as elevation of the serum ALP, gamma-GTP and/or total bilirubin levels to >= twice the ULN, was seen in 4 patients (11.4%). A total of 9 patients (25.7%) fulfilled the criteria for liver injury. The percentage of patients with liver injury was higher in patients with severe COVID-19 than in the remaining patients (P = 0.001). Both the hepatic CT attenuation values and the liver-to-spleen attenuation (L/S) ratios at admission were lower in the former patients than in the latter patients (P < 0.001).

Neuropeptide E-I (NEI) displays functional MCH-antagonist and MSH-agonist activity in different behavioral paradigms; the role of neuropeptide G-E (NGE) is not known. This study addressed the question of possible molecular interactions between alpha-MSH  MCH and the MCH-precursor-derived peptides NEI and NGE at the level of the pigment cell MCH receptor subtype (MCH-Rpc) and the different melanocortin (MC) receptors. Radioreceptor assays using [125I]MCH  [125l]alpha-MSH and [125I]NEI as radioligands and bioassays were performed with MCI-R-positive and MC1-R-negative mouse B16 melanoma cells and with COS cells expressing the different MC receptors. The IC50s of alpha-MSH and NEI or NGE for [125I]MCH displacement from mouse MCH-Rpc were 80-fold and  respectively  >300-fold higher than that of MCH  and the IC50s for MCH and NEI or NGE for [125I]alpha-MSH displacement from mouse MC1-R were 50 000-fold and >200 000-fold higher than that of alpha-MSH. No high-affinity binding sites for NEI were detected on B16 melanoma cells and there was no significant displacement of [1251]alpha-MSH by MCH  NEI or NGE with MC3-R  MC4-R and MC5-R expressed in COS cells.

428,31052,Can hematological and biochemical parameters fasten the diagnosis of COVID-19 in emergency departments?,"INTRODUCTION:  The primary aim of the study was to compare the laboratory and radiological parameters of COVID-19 positive and negative patients confirmed by Real-Time Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR), and Chest Computed Tomography (CCT) of patients admitting with the suspicion of COVID-19. The secondary purpose of the study was to find objective parameters to speed up the clinician for further examination, treatment or referral decision in COVID-19 suspicion. MATERIAL AND METHODS:  A total of 61 COVID-19 suspected patients were evaluated in the study. Swab samples were taken for RT-PCR analysis. CCT was taken for 42 patients who described dyspnea. According to CCT and RT-PCR results, the patient population was divided into 2 groups as COVID-19 positive group (n = 32); and COVID-19 negative group (n = 29). Between two groups; demographic, clinical, laboratory and radiological parameters were compared.  RESULTS:  Male gender (p = 0.03), PLR value (p = 0.021) and CO-RADS scores were higher in the COVID-19 positive group. Oxygen saturation (SaO2) (p = 0.027) and PCT, WBC, Neutrophil count, Lymphocyte count values were significantly low in COVID-19 positive group (p = 0.03, p = 0.001, p = 0.017, p = 0.021, respectively). PLR showed a positive correlation with fever, CRP, neutrophil count and NLR, which are indicators of inflammation.

The secondary purpose of the study was to find objective parameters to speed up the clinician for further examination, treatment or referral decision in COVID-19 suspicion. MATERIAL AND METHODS:  A total of 61 COVID-19 suspected patients were evaluated in the study. Swab samples were taken for RT-PCR analysis. CCT was taken for 42 patients who described dyspnea. According to CCT and RT-PCR results, the patient population was divided into 2 groups as COVID-19 positive group (n = 32); and COVID-19 negative group (n = 29). Between two groups; demographic, clinical, laboratory and radiological parameters were compared.  RESULTS:  Male gender (p = 0.03), PLR value (p = 0.021) and CO-RADS scores were higher in the COVID-19 positive group.

We performed combined [99mTc]MDP bone scans and indium-111 (111In) leukocyte studies on 35 patients who had radiographic evidence of neuropathic foot disease and clinically suspected osteomyelitis. The [111In]leukocyte study determined if there was an infection and the bone scan provided the anatomic landmarks so that the infection could be localized to the bone or the adjacent soft tissue. Seventeen patients had osteomyelitis and all showed increased [111In]leukocyte activity localized to the bone  giving a sensitivity of 100%. Among the 18 patients without osteomyelitis  eight had no accumulation of [111In]leukocytes  seven had the [111In]leukocyte activity correctly localized to the soft tissue  two had [111In]leukocyte activity mistakenly attributed to the bone  and one had [111In]leukocyte accumulation in a proven neuroma which was mistakenly attributed to bone. These three false-positive results for osteomyelitis reduced the specificity to 83%.

However  there has been little work on the effect of atrophy on the cortical folding patterns. In this study  we examined whether the cortical folding could be used as a biomarker of AD. Cortical folding metrics were computed on 678 patients from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort. For each subject  the boundary between grey matter and white matter was extracted using a level set technique. At each point on the boundary two metrics characterising folding  curvedness and shape index  were generated. Joint histograms using these metrics were calculated for five regions of interest (ROIs): frontal  temporal  occipital  and parietal lobes as well as the cingulum. Pixelwise statistical maps were generated from the joint histograms using permutations tests. In each ROI  a significant reduction was observed between controls and AD in areas associated with the sulcal folds  suggesting a sulcal opening associated with neurodegeneration. When comparing to MCI patients  the regions of significance were smaller but overlapping with those regions found comparing controls to AD. It indicates that the differences in cortical folding are progressive and can be detected before formal diagnosis of AD. Our preliminary analysis showed a viable signal in the cortical folding patterns for Alzheimer's disease that should be explored further.,0,Cortical folding analysis on patients with Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment.Cortical thinning is a widely used and powerful biomarker for measuring disease progression in Alzheimer's disease (AD).

TBM analysis requires non-rigid registrations which are often subject to registration errors. When using multiple templates and  therefore  multiple registrations  it can be assumed that the registration errors are averaged and eventually compensated. Four different methods are proposed for multi-template TBM.

The performance of TBM features in classifying images was evaluated both quantitatively and qualitatively. Classification results show that the multi-template methods are statistically significantly better than the single-template method. The overall classification accuracy was 86.0% for the classification of control and AD subjects  and 72.1% for the classification of stable and progressive MCI subjects.

438,34599,The use of intravenous immunoglobulin gamma for the treatment of severe coronavirus disease 2019: a randomized placebo-controlled double-blind clinical trial,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has infected people in many countries worldwide. Discovering an effective treatment for this disease, particularly in severe cases, has become the subject of intense scientific investigation. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) in patients with severe COVID-19 infection. METHODS: This study was conducted as a randomized placebo-controlled double-blind clinical trial. Fifty-nine patients with severe COVID-19 infection who did not respond to initial treatments were randomly assigned into two groups. One group received IVIg (human)-four vials daily for 3 days (in addition to initial treatment), while the other group received a placebo. Patients' demographic, clinical, and select laboratory test results, as well as the occurrence of in-hospital mortality, were recorded. RESULTS: Among total study subjects, 30 patients received IVIg and 29 patients received a placebo. Demographics, clinical characteristics, and laboratory tests were not statistically different (P > 0.05) between the two groups. The in-hospital mortality rate was significantly lower in the IVIg group compared to the control group (6 [20.0%] vs. 14 [48.3%], respectively; P = 0.022). Multivariate regression analysis demonstrated that administration of IVIg did indeed have a significant impact on mortality rate (aOR = 0.003 [95% CI: 0.001-0.815]; P = 0.042). CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated that the administration of IVIg in patients with severe COVID-19 infection who did not respond to initial treatment could improve their clinical outcome and significantly reduce mortality rate.

Previous studies have linked affective and cognitive symptoms of MDD to white matter (WM) disruption in limbic-cortical circuits. However  the relationship between clinical cognitive deficits and loss of integrity in particular WM tracts is poorly understood. Fractional anisotropy (FA) as a measure of WM integrity was investigated in 17 elderly MDD subjects in comparison with 18 age-matched controls using tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) and correlated with clinical and cognitive parameters. MDD patients revealed significantly reduced FA in the right posterior cingulate cluster (PCC) compared with controls. FA in the right PCC (but not in the left PCC) showed a significant positive correlation with performance in a verbal naming task  and showed a non-significant trend toward a correlation with verbal fluency and episodic memory performance. In control subjects  no correlations were found between cognitive tasks and FA values either in the right or left PCC. Results provide additional evidence supporting the neuronal disconnection hypothesis in MDD and suggest that cognitive deficits are related to the loss of integrity in WM tracts associated with the disorder.,0,Association of microstructural white matter abnormalities with cognitive dysfunction in geriatric patients with major depression.Major depression disorder (MDD) is one of the most common causes of disability in people over 60years of age.

443,46228,Restored degradation of the Alzheimer's amyloid-beta peptide by targeting amyloid formation.,Accumulation of neurotoxic amyloid-beta (Abeta) is central to the pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Elucidating the mechanisms of Abeta accumulation will therefore expedite the development of Abeta-targeting AD therapeutics. We examined activity of an Abeta-degrading protease (matrix metalloprotease 2) to investigate whether biochemical factors consistent with conditions in the AD brain contribute to Abeta accumulation by altering Abeta sensitivity to proteolytic degradation. An Abeta amino acid mutation found in familial AD  Abeta interactions with zinc (Zn)  and increased Abeta hydrophobicity all strongly prevented Abeta degradation. Consistent to all of these factors is the promotion of specific Abeta aggregates where the protease cleavage site  confirmed by mass spectrometry  is inaccessible within an amyloid structure. These data indicate decreased degradation due to amyloid formation initiates Abeta accumulation by preventing normal protease activity. Zn also prevented Abeta degradation by the proteases neprilysin and insulin degrading enzyme. Treating Zn-induced Abeta amyloid with the metal-protein attenuating compound clioquinol reversed amyloid formation and restored the peptide's sensitivity to degradation by matrix metalloprotease 2. This provides new data indicating that therapeutic compounds designed to modulate Abeta-metal interactions can inhibit Abeta accumulation by restoring the catalytic potential of Abeta-degrading proteases.,0,Restored degradation of the Alzheimer's amyloid-beta peptide by targeting amyloid formation.Accumulation of neurotoxic amyloid-beta (Abeta) is central to the pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD).

444,7147,Microglial overexpression of the M-CSF receptor augments phagocytosis of opsonized Abeta.,The role of microglia in Alzheimer's disease (AD) has come under intense scrutiny recently because microglia may clear amyloid beta (Abeta) by phagocytosis after immunization of transgenic mice. Increased expression of the macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor (M-CSFR) is an important feature of microglia in AD and transgenic mouse models for AD. Increased expression of M-CSFR on mouse and human microglia accelerates phagocytosis of aggregated Abeta in part through macrophage scavenger receptors. We now show that Abeta phagocytosis by microglia overexpressing M-CSFR is further enhanced by antibody opsonization of Abeta. M-CSFR overexpression increased microglial phagocytosis of opsonized aggregated Abeta in culture medium  and accelerated ingestion of native Abeta from AD brain sections. M-CSFR overexpression also increased microglial expression of Fcgamma receptors  and blocking Fcgamma receptors attenuated the enhanced Abeta uptake observed after M-CSFR overexpression and antibody opsonization. Microglia in AD and in AD mouse models with increased expression of M-CSFR are likely to rapidly ingest opsonized Abeta after immunization  making high intracerebral antibody titers unnecessary.,0,Microglial overexpression of the M-CSF receptor augments phagocytosis of opsonized Abeta.The role of microglia in Alzheimer's disease (AD) has come under intense scrutiny recently because microglia may clear amyloid beta (Abeta) by phagocytosis after immunization of transgenic mice.

445,4226,Sentinel lymph-node biopsy for melanoma of the trunk and extremities: the McGill experience.,OBJECTIVE: To determine the effectiveness of sentinel lymph-node (SLN) biopsy for melanoma of the trunk and extremities. DESIGN: Case series review. SETTING: Royal Victoria Hospital  a Canadian university hospital. PATIENTS: Thirty-six patients (18 women and 18 men) seen between October 1996 and December 1998 with melanoma 1 mm or more in thickness with clinically negative lymph-node basins. Follow-up was 396 days. INTERVENTIONS: SLN biopsy. Technetium-99m filtered sulfur colloid (0.5 mCi) was injected intradermally around the melanoma or the excision scar 10 to 15 minutes before the surgical skin preparation. The identification of the SLN(s) was done with a hand-held gamma probe. Local anesthesia was used mostly for inguinal SLN biopsy whereas general anesthesia was usually required for axillary SLN biopsy. Preoperative lymphoscintigraphy was used only for trunk melanomas. OUTCOME MEASURES: Morbidity  successful identification of the sentinel node and locoregional recurrence. RESULTS: The mean age of patients at diagnosis was 53.4 years (range from 22-76 yr). The melanomas were distributed between the lower extremities (20 patients)  upper extremities (8 patients) and trunk (8 patients). The mean Breslow thickness was 2.35 mm (range from 1-8 mm). Lymphoscintigraphy accurately localized the lymph-node drainage basin for trunk melanomas. In 1 patient the SLN could not be identified because the radiocolloid failed to migrate (failure rate 2.8%). The average number of SLNs removed was 1.97. Eight patients (22%) had sentinel nodes positive for malignant disease. The postoperative complication rate was 8.5%. Seven of 8 patients with positive SLNs underwent a complete node dissection (1 patient refused). Of the completion dissections only 2 patients had positive non-SLNs. All patients with positive nodes received interferon alpha-2b as adjuvant treatment. At follow-up  34 patients are alive with no evidence of disease  1 patient with a positive SLN is alive with distant metastatic disease and 1 patient with a negative SLN is dead of disseminated disease. CONCLUSION: SLN biopsy is a feasible technique with an acceptable failure rate and is thus a useful tool in the surgical management of melanoma.,0,Sentinel lymph-node biopsy for melanoma of the trunk and extremities: the McGill experience.OBJECTIVE: To determine the effectiveness of sentinel lymph-node (SLN) biopsy for melanoma of the trunk and extremities.

447,51007,Ultrahigh speed endoscopic optical coherence tomography and angiography for investigating terminal ileum with chronic inflammation,"Background/Aims: Optical coherence tomography (OCT) enables three-dimensional (3D) examination of the tissue architecture with micrometer resolution. In previous studies, endoscopic OCT was used to provide structural information correlated with histology for gastrointestinal pathologies. However, the utility of endoscopic OCT for investigating the pathology of the terminal ileum (TI) in patients with symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), for example, has been very limited. Endoscopically, reaching the TI entails advancing the colonoscope through multiple sharp bends of the colon, which prevents smooth rotation of previous generations of proximally actuated probes. Recently, our group has developed ultrahigh speed endoscopic OCT technology with a micromotor imaging probe, which enables precise volumetric imaging by avoiding the non-uniform rotational distortion inherent in proximally actuated probes. In this study, we reported structural and vascular changes of TI with chronic inflammation using endoscopic OCT and OCT angiography (OCTA). Methods: This prototype endoscopic OCT system achieves an imaging speed of 600,000 A-scans per second and a frame rate of 400 frames per second. The diameter of the imaging probe was small enough to pass through the accessory port of the colonoscope, enabling coregistered biopsies. OCTA visualized microvasculature by measuring decorrelation between sequential OCT images to generate motion contrast from blood flow. The study was performed at the Veterans Affairs Boston Healthcare System (VABHS) with the approval from the institutional review boards from VABHS, Harvard Medical School, and MIT. Results: Figure 1 shows OCT images of a normal TI (Figs. 1(A, B)) and TI with chronic inflammation (Figs. 1(C, D)) as well as the coregistered en face OCTA (Fig. 1(E)) at the same depth as Fig. 1(C). Typical villous structure of normal TI can be observed in Fig. 1(A) at 100 ﾎｼm depth, which was consistent with the colonoscopy findings (inset, Fig. 1(A)). The slight tilted orientation of the villi was caused by the gentle pressing of the imaging probe, which was observed along the cross-sectional OCT image as well (Fig. 1(B)). On the contrary, a loss of villous structure and nodular mucosal appearance were identified in Fig. 1(C) of TI with chronic inflammation, which was confirmed by the coregistered biopsy. In addition, a decreased imaging depth was observed in the cross-sectional OCT image (Fig. 1(D)). Fig 1(E) shows the coregistered en face OCTA as Fig. 1(C) where increased vasculature with abnormal vascular branching was observed.

449,16883,Modeling the trend of coronavirus disease 2019 and restoration of operational capability of metropolitan medical service in China: a machine learning and mathematical model-based analysis,"Background: To contain the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China, many unprecedented intervention measures are adopted by the government. However, these measures may interfere in the normal medical service. We sought to model the trend of COVID-19 and estimate the restoration of operational capability of metropolitan medical service in China. Methods: Real-time data of COVID-19 and population mobility data were extracted from open sources. SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, Recovered) and neural network models (NNs) were built to model disease trends in Wuhan, Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou. Combined with public transportation data, Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model was used to estimate the accumulated demands for nonlocal hospitalization during the epidemic period in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou. Results: The number of infected people and deaths would increase by 45% and 567% respectively, given that the government only has implemented traffic control in Wuhan without additional medical professionals. The epidemic of Wuhan (measured by cumulative confirmed cases) was predicted to reach turning point at the end of March and end in later April, 2020. The outbreak in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou was predicted to end at the end of March and the medical service could be fully back to normal in middle of April. During the epidemic, the number of nonlocal inpatient hospitalizations decreased by 69.86%, 57.41% and 66.85% in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou respectively. After the end of epidemic, medical centers located in these metropolises may face 58,799 (95% CI 48926-67,232) additional hospitalization needs in the first month. Conclusion: The COVID-19 epidemic in China has been effectively contained and medical service across the country is expected to return to normal in April. However, the huge unmet medical needs for other diseases could result in massive migration of patients and their families, bringing tremendous challenges for medical service in major metropolis and disease control for the potential asymptomatic virus carrier.

452,63959,COVID-19 Resilience for Survival: Occurrence of Domestic Violence During Lockdown at a Rural American College of Surgeons Verified Level One Trauma Center,"Background As the early peak phase in the coronavirus outbreak has intensified, stay-at-home mandates requiring identified individuals as nonessential were advised to remain home to prevent community transmission of the disease. Further mandates escalated isolated environments such as school closures, social distancing, travel restrictions, closure of public gathering spaces, and business closures. As citizens were forced to stay home during the pandemic, the crisis created intensifying stressors and isolation, which fostered an environment for increased domestic violence. Methods A retrospective review of all emergency department (ED) patients that presented to an American College of Surgeons (ACS) verified rural level one trauma center with associated diagnostic coding for assault was conducted during the Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) lockdown, integral dates March 16, 2020 to April 30, 2020. In particular the identification of proportional assaults that presented to the ED after school closures (March 16, 2020) was compared to the previous year (March 16, 2019 to April 30, 2019). The data collected included patient characteristics, grouping by mechanism, grouping by a specific mechanism, and domestic violence perpetrators. Results A statistically significant (p = 0.01) increase in assaults was found during the COVID-19 lockdown, particularly during the period after school closures. Conclusions Although overall trauma volume was reduced during the COVID-19 stay-at-home mandates, a significant increase in domestic violence assaults was observed. Largely the assaults were perpetrated against white men by partners and unspecified nonfamily members, which were predominantly penetrating injuries.

453,4200,Elucidation of O-glycosylation structures of the beta-amyloid precursor protein by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry using electron transfer dissociation and collision induced dissociation.,Accumulation and deposition of beta-amyloid peptide  a major constituent in neuritic plaques are hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and AD-related neurodegenerative diseases. beta-Amyloid (Abeta) is derived from the proteolytic cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP)  a transmembrane protein present in three major isoforms in brain comprising 695  751 and 770 amino acids  respectively. Among other post-translational modifications  APP is modified during maturation by N- and O-glycosylation  which are thought to be responsible for its expression and secretion. Unlike N-glycosylation  no sites of O-glycosylation of APP have previously been reported. We report here the identification of three specific O-glycosylation sites of the secreted APP695 (sAPP695) produced in CHO cells  using a combination of high-performance liquid chromatography and electrospray-tandem mass spectrometry. With the use of electron transfer dissociation and collision induced dissociation (ETD and CID)  we identified type  composition and structures of the Core 1 type O-linked glycans attached at the residues Thr 291  Thr 292 and Thr 576 of the full-length APP695. The glycosylations comprise multiple short glycans  containing N-acetyl galactosamine (GalNAc)  Gal-GalNAc and sialic acid terminated structures. The presence of the glycopeptides in the tryptic mixture was identified using the CID-generated sugar oxonium ions. ETD proved to be valuable for the unambiguous identification of the modified sites as ETD fragmentation occurred along the peptide backbone with little or no cleavage of the glycans. Thus  the combination of the CID and ETD techniques in LC-MS is shown here  as a powerful tool for de novo identification of O-glycosylations at unknown modification sites in proteins.,0,Elucidation of O-glycosylation structures of the beta-amyloid precursor protein by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry using electron transfer dissociation and collision induced dissociation.Accumulation and deposition of beta-amyloid peptide  a major constituent in neuritic plaques are hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and AD-related neurodegenerative diseases. beta-Amyloid (Abeta) is derived from the proteolytic cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP)  a transmembrane protein present in three major isoforms in brain comprising 695  751 and 770 amino acids  respectively. Among other post-translational modifications  APP is modified during maturation by N- and O-glycosylation  which are thought to be responsible for its expression and secretion. Unlike N-glycosylation  no sites of O-glycosylation of APP have previously been reported. We report here the identification of three specific O-glycosylation sites of the secreted APP695 (sAPP695) produced in CHO cells  using a combination of high-performance liquid chromatography and electrospray-tandem mass spectrometry. With the use of electron transfer dissociation and collision induced dissociation (ETD and CID)  we identified type  composition and structures of the Core 1 type O-linked glycans attached at the residues Thr 291  Thr 292 and Thr 576 of the full-length APP695. The glycosylations comprise multiple short glycans  containing N-acetyl galactosamine (GalNAc)  Gal-GalNAc and sialic acid terminated structures. The presence of the glycopeptides in the tryptic mixture was identified using the CID-generated sugar oxonium ions. ETD proved to be valuable for the unambiguous identification of the modified sites as ETD fragmentation occurred along the peptide backbone with little or no cleavage of the glycans.

It has led to economic crises and health emergencies across the world, spreading rapidly among the human population and has caused many deaths. Currently, there are no treatments available for COVID-19 so there is an urgent need to develop therapeutic interventions that could be used against the novel coronavirus infection. In this research, we used computational drug design technologies to repurpose existing drugs as inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins. The Broad Institute's Drug Repurposing Hub consists of in-development/approved drugs and was computationally screened to identify potential hits which could inhibit protein targets encoded by the SARS-CoV-2 genome. By virtually screening the Broad collection, using rationally designed pharmacophore features, we identified molecules which may be repurposed against viral nucleocapsid and non-structural proteins. The pharmacophore features were generated after careful visualisation of the interactions between co-crystalised ligands and the protein binding site. The ChEMBL database was used to determine the compound's level of inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 and correlate the predicted viral protein target with whole virus in vitro data. The results from this study may help to accelerate drug development against COVID-19 and the hit compounds should be progressed through further in vitro and in vivo studies on SARS-CoV-2.",0,"Repurposing drugs for treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection: computational design insights into mechanisms of actionThe COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected human life globally.

455,52753,COVID-Align: Accurate online alignment of hCoV-19 genomes using a profile HMM,"MOTIVATION: The first cases of the COVID-19 pandemic emerged in December 2019. Until the end of February 2020, the number of available genomes was below 1,000, and their multiple alignment was easily achieved using standard approaches. Subsequently, the availability of genomes has grown dramatically. Moreover, some genomes are of low quality with sequencing/assembly errors, making accurate re-alignment of all genomes nearly impossible on a daily basis. A more efficient, yet accurate approach was clearly required to pursue all subsequent bioinformatics analyses of this crucial data. RESULTS: hCoV-19 genomes are highly conserved, with very few indels and no recombination. This makes the profile HMM approach particularly well suited to align new genomes, add them to an existing alignment and filter problematic ones. Using a core of ~2,500 high quality genomes, we estimated a profile using HMMER, and implemented this profile in COVID-Align, a user-friendly interface to be used online or as standalone via Docker. The alignment of 1,000 genomes requires ~50mn on our cluster.

456,23734,Consistent multi-time-point brain atrophy estimation from the boundary shift integral.,Brain atrophy measurement is increasingly important in studies of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD)  with particular relevance to trials of potential disease-modifying drugs. Automated registration-based methods such as the boundary shift integral (BSI) have been developed to provide more precise measures of change from a pair of serial MR scans. However  when a method treats one image of the pair (typically the baseline) as the reference to which the other is compared  this systematic asymmetry risks introducing bias into the measurement. Recent concern about potential biases in longitudinal studies has led to several suggestions to use symmetric image registration  though some of these methods are limited to two time-points per subject. Therapeutic trials and natural history studies increasingly involve several serial scans  it would therefore be useful to have a method that can consistently estimate brain atrophy over multiple time-points. Here  we use the log-Euclidean concept of a within-subject average to develop affine registration and differential bias correction methods suitable for any number of time-points  yielding a longitudinally consistent multi-time-point BSI technique. Baseline  12-month and 24-month MR scans of healthy controls  subjects with mild cognitive impairment and AD patients from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative are used for testing the bias in processing scans with different amounts of atrophy. Four tests are used to assess bias in brain volume loss from BSI: (a) inverse consistency with respect to ordering of pairs of scans 12 months apart; (b) transitivity consistency over three time-points; (c) randomly ordered back-to-back scans  expected to show no consistent change over subjects; and (d) linear regression of the atrophy rates calculated from the baseline and 12-month scans and the baseline and 24-month scans  where any additive bias should be indicated by a non-zero intercept. Results indicate that the traditional BSI processing pipeline does not exhibit significant bias due to its use of windowed sinc interpolation  but with linear interpolation and asymmetric registration  bias can be pronounced. Either improved interpolation or symmetric registration alone can greatly reduce this bias  and our proposed method combining both aspects shows no significant bias in any of the four experiments.,0,Consistent multi-time-point brain atrophy estimation from the boundary shift integral.Brain atrophy measurement is increasingly important in studies of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD)  with particular relevance to trials of potential disease-modifying drugs.

Ongoing efforts to control the pandemic include the development of peptide-based vaccines and diagnostic tests. In these approaches, HLA allelic diversity plays a crucial role. Despite its importance, current knowledge of HLA allele frequencies in South America is very limited. In this study, we have performed a literature review of datasets reporting HLA frequencies of South American populations, available in scientific literature and/or in the Allele Frequency Net Database. This allowed us to enrich the current scenario with more than 12.8 million data points. As a result, we are presenting updated HLA allelic frequencies based on country, including 91 alleles that were previously thought to have frequencies either under 5% or of an unknown value. Using alleles with an updated frequency of at least >=5% in any South American country, we predicted epitopes in SARS-CoV-2 proteins using NetMHCpan (I and II) and MHC flurry. Then, the best predicted epitopes (class-I and -II) were selected based on their binding to South American alleles (Coverage Score). Class II predicted epitopes were also filtered based on their three-dimensional exposure. We obtained 14 class-I and four class-II candidate epitopes with experimental evidence (reported in the Immune Epitope Database and Analysis Resource), having good coverage scores for South America. Additionally, we are presenting 13 HLA-I and 30 HLA-II novel candidate epitopes without experimental evidence, including 16 class-II candidates in highly exposed conserved areas of the NTD and RBD regions of the Spike protein. These novel candidates have even better coverage scores for South America than those with experimental evidence. Finally, we show that recent similar studies presenting candidate epitopes also predicted some of our candidates but discarded them in the selection process, resulting in candidates with suboptimal coverage for South America. In conclusion, the candidate epitopes presented provide valuable information for the development of epitope-based strategies against SARS-CoV-2, such as peptide vaccines and diagnostic tests. Additionally, the updated HLA allelic frequencies provide a better representation of South America and may impact different immunogenetic studies.Â© Copyright Â© 2020 Requena, Medico, Chacon, Ramirez and Marin-Sanchez.",0,"Identification of Novel Candidate Epitopes on SARS-CoV-2 Proteins for South America: A Review of HLA Frequencies by CountryCoronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2, is already responsible for more than 4.3 million confirmed cases and 295,000 deaths worldwide as of May 15, 2020.

Arthritis was monoarticular in 28 (70%) of 40 cases with predilection for large weight-bearing joints. Spine and small joints were spared. Brucella melitensis was detected in 23/31 (74%) cases. Mild anaemia  leucopenia  increased liver enzymes  positive acute phase reactants  and low titres of autoantibodies were prominent non-specific laboratory findings. Bone scintigraphy was more helpful than conventional radiography in detecting hip and sacroiliac joint disease. Treatment with a combination of antibiotics for six weeks or more resulted in a cure rate of 92.5%.

466,29926,Emergency Department and Out-of-Hospital Emergency System (112-AREU 118) integrated response to Coronavirus Disease 2019 in a Northern Italy centre,"Since December 2019, the world has been facing the life-threatening disease, named Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19), recognized as a pandemic by the World Health Organization. The response of the Emergency Medicine network, integrating ""out-of-hospital"" and ""hospital"" activation, is crucial whenever the health system has to face a medical emergency, being caused by natural or human-derived disasters as well as by a rapidly spreading epidemic outbreak. We here report the Pavia Emergency Medicine network response to the COVID-19 outbreak. The ""out-of-hospital"" response was analysed in terms of calls, rescues and missions, whereas the ""hospital"" response was detailed as number of admitted patients and subsequent hospitalisation or discharge. The data in the first 5 weeks of the Covid-19 outbreak (February 21-March 26, 2020) were compared with a reference time window referring to the previous 5 weeks (January 17-February 20, 2020) and with the corresponding historical average data from the previous 5 years (February 21-March 26). Since February 21, 2020, a sudden and sustained increase in the calls to the AREU 112 system was noted (+ 440%). After 5 weeks, the number of calls and missions was still higher as compared to both the reference pre-Covid-19 period (+ 48% and + 10%, respectively) and the historical control (+ 53% and + 22%, respectively). Owing to the overflow from the neighbouring hospitals, which rapidly became overwhelmed and had to temporarily close patient access, the population served by the Pavia system more than doubled (from 547.251 to 1.135.977 inhabitants, + 108%). To minimize the possibility of intra-hospital spreading of the infection, a separate ""Emergency Department-Infective Disease"" was created, which evaluated 1241 patients with suspected infection (38% of total ED admissions). Out of these 1241 patients, 58.0% (n = 720) were admitted in general wards (n = 629) or intensive care unit (n = 91). To allow this massive number of admissions, the hospital reshaped many general ward Units, which became Covid-19 Units (up to 270 beds) and increased the intensive care unit beds from 32 to 60. In the setting of a long-standing continuing emergency like the present Covid-19 outbreak, the integration, interaction and team work of the ""out-of-hospital"" and ""in-hospital"" systems have a pivotal role. The present study reports how the rapid and coordinated reorganization of both might help in facing such a disaster.

467,62013,Endoscopic dilation of an anastomotic diaphragm in ulcerative colitis: A case report,"Introduction: This case report involves a 40 year old male with ulcerative colitis status post restorative proctocolectomy with ileal pouchanal anastomosis. Post-operative complications included pouch torsion and anastomotic leak necessitating a diversion loop ileostomy and pouch revision with end-to-end ileum to pouch anastomosis. Prior to planned ileostomy takedown, contrast studies and pouchoscopy demonstrated complete obstruction at the anastomosis. Patient was referred for endoscopic therapy. Methods: Simultaneous insertion of gastroscopes into the ileostomy and pouch demonstrated an obstructive thin membrane at the anastomosis. Transillumination across the obstruction was utilized to identify the lumen of the anastomosis. After insertion of a 19 gauge endoscopic ultrasound needle through the membrane, serial balloon dilations were performed. Results: Following dilation, both gastroscopes were successfully passed across the anastomosis. No evidence of bleeding, perforation or dehiscence was observed at end of procedure. No peri-procedural complications occurred. Post-procedure contrast study at 1 week demonstrated no evidence of obstruction. Intra-operative ileoscopy and pouchoscopy demonstrated patent surgical anastomosis. Subsequent successful ileostomy takedown was performed with patient asymptomatic at 1 month follow-up. Conclusion: Diaphragm disease (DD) manifests as the development of circumferential mucosal membranes that occlude intestinal lumen and may lead to strictures or complete obstruction. This rare condition is most commonly associated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use. Resection is the most common therapy. This is the first reported case of DD involving an ileum to pouch anastomosis. Additionally, the patient has no prior NSAID exposure. This case demonstrates that utilization of bidirectional endoscopies with transillumination and dilation is a feasible, safe, and effective method to re-establish lumen patency in small bowel obstructions secondary to luminal diaphragms.",0,"Endoscopic dilation of an anastomotic diaphragm in ulcerative colitis: A case reportIntroduction: This case report involves a 40 year old male with ulcerative colitis status post restorative proctocolectomy with ileal pouchanal anastomosis.

469,54363,Community venue exposure risk estimator for the COVID-19 pandemic,"Complexities of virus genotypes and the stochastic contacts in human society create a big challenge for estimating the potential risks of exposure to a widely spreading virus such as COVID-19. To increase public awareness of exposure risks in daily activities, we propose a birthday-paradox-based probability model to implement in a web-based system, named COSRE (community social risk estimator) and make in-time community exposure risk estimation during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. We define exposure risk to mean the probability of people meeting potential cases in public places such as grocery stores, gyms, libraries, restaurants, coffee shops, offices, etc. Our model has three inputs: the real-time number of active and asymptomatic cases, the population in local communities, and the customer counts in the room. With COSRE, possible impacts of the pandemic can be explored through spatiotemporal analysis, e.g., a variable number of people may be projected into public places through time to assess changes of risk as the pandemic unfolds. The system has potential to advance understanding of the true exposure risks in various communities. It introduces an objective element to plan, prepare and respond during a pandemic. Spatial analysis tools are used to draw county-level exposure risks of the United States from April 1 to July 15, 2020. The correlation experiment with the new cases in the next two weeks shows that the risk estimation model offers promise in assisting people to be more precise about their personal safety and control of daily routine and social interaction.

One review of diagnostic criteria found that out of 10 sets of criteria  only the UK refinement of the Hanifin and Rajka criteria have been adequately tested (in 19 studies). Another review of 20 named outcome measures found that only three [SCORing Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD)  the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) and the Patient Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM)] had been tested and found to perform adequately. In terms of risk factors for developing disease  a review found that birth by caesarean section increased the risk of asthma and hay fever but not eczema in offspring. A review of cohort studies also found evidence that adverse psychological factors in early life predispose to more atopic disease and a worse prognosis. Another review found that filaggrin gene mutations were a consistently strong risk factor for AE  with a person carrying one of these mutations being over three times more likely to exhibit eczema. It has been suggested that eczema might protect against some forms of cancer  and a detailed systematic review of brain cancers that included 53 233 participants from eight case-control and cohort studies found that having atopic disease was associated with a 39% reduction in glioma risk  a finding that was also present for just those with AE (odds ratio 0.69  95% CI 0.58-0.82). A further review of case-control and cohort studies failed to find any association between keeping furry pets at birth and subsequent risk of eczema  although pet fur might still exacerbate established disease. In terms of disease consequences  a review found that eczema was the commonest cause of chronic sleep loss in young people  affected the whole family.

It has been suggested that eczema might protect against some forms of cancer  and a detailed systematic review of brain cancers that included 53 233 participants from eight case-control and cohort studies found that having atopic disease was associated with a 39% reduction in glioma risk  a finding that was also present for just those with AE (odds ratio 0.69  95% CI 0.58-0.82). A further review of case-control and cohort studies failed to find any association between keeping furry pets at birth and subsequent risk of eczema  although pet fur might still exacerbate established disease. In terms of disease consequences  a review found that eczema was the commonest cause of chronic sleep loss in young people  affected the whole family. A review of four economic studies from the US found that the annual cost of AE in the States was as high as $3.8 billion when indirect costs are included. © 2009 British Association of Dermatologists.","{'judgement': 'False', 'index': 474}",0,"{'judgement': 'False', 'index': 474}",0,"{'judgement': 'False', 'index': 474}",0
475,66692,Tetracycline affects abnormal properties of synthetic PrP peptides and PrP(Sc) in vitro.,Prion diseases are characterized by the accumulation of altered forms of the prion protein (termed PrP(Sc)) in the brain.

Evidence indicates that they are responsible for neuropathological changes (i.e. nerve cell degeneration and glial cell activation) and transmissibility of the disease process. Here  we show that the antibiotic tetracycline: (i) binds to amyloid fibrils generated by synthetic peptides corresponding to residues 106-126 and 82-146 of human PrP; (ii) hinders assembly of these peptides into amyloid fibrils; (iii) reverts the protease resistance of PrP peptide aggregates and PrP(Sc) extracted from brain tissue of patients with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease; (iv) prevents neuronal death and astrocyte proliferation induced by PrP peptides in vitro. NMR spectroscopy revealed several through-space interactions between aromatic protons of tetracycline and side-chain protons of Ala(117-119)  Val(121-122) and Leu(125) of PrP 106-126.

SARS-CoV-2 usually attacks the lungs causing a wide range of symptoms ranging from mild dyspnea to severe shortness of breath requiring intubation. Elevation of liver transaminases in the patients' sera has been described in up to 53% of the COVID-19 positive patients. The underlying pathogenic mechanisms of the virus on the liver cells are unclear and only few hypotheses are currently available. Data on COVID-19 in pregnant women are lacking and the management of COVID-19 pregnant women is challenging. An elevation of the transaminases during pregnancies infected by SARS-CoV-2 has never been described before. METHODS: Here we presented the case of a 29 years-old patient at 38 weeks of gestation COVID-19 positive with elevated transaminases. RESULTS: The patient showed a progressive decrease of transaminases after the delivery of the fetus. We provided details about the daily transaminases trend, the therapy used and the maternal/neonatal outcomes.

Diagnosis and monitoring by leukocyte scanning with indium in 111 oxyquinoline,OBJECTIVE: The prevalence of osteomyelitis in diabetic foot ulcers is unknown. Early diagnosis of this infection is critical  as prompt antibiotic treatment decreases the rate of amputation. We therefore assessed the prevalence of osteomyelitis in 35 diabetic patients with 41 foot ulcers. We compared results of roentgenograms  leukocyte scans with indium In 111 oxyquinoline  and bone scans with the diagnostic criterion standards of bone histologic and culture findings. Leukocyte scans were repeated at 2- to 3-week intervals during antibiotic treatment. DESIGN: Cohort study. SETTING: Institutional and private  ambulatory and hospitalized patients. PATIENTS: Consecutive sample of 54 diabetic patients. Thirty-five patients with 41 foot ulcers were included. RESULTS: As determined by bone biopsy and culture  osteomyelitis was found to underlie 28 (68%) of 41 diabetic foot ulcers. Only nine (32%) of the 28 cases were diagnosed clinically by the referring physician. Underscoring the clinically silent nature of osteomyelitis in these ulcers  19 (68%) of 28 occurred in outpatients  19 (68%) of 28 occurred in ulcers not exposing bone  and 18 (64%) of 28 had no evidence of inflammation on physical examination. All patients with ulcers that exposed bone had osteomyelitis. Of the imaging tests  the leukocyte scan had the highest sensitivity  89%. In patients with osteomyelitis  the leukocyte scan image intensity decreased by 16 to 34 days of antibiotic treatment and normalized by 36 to 54 days. CONCLUSION: The majority of diabetic foot ulcers have an underlying osteomyelitis that is clinically unsuspected. Leukocyte scans are highly sensitive for diagnosing osteomyelitis in diabetic foot ulcers and may be useful for monitoring the efficacy of antibiotic treatment. We recommend that diabetic patients with foot ulcers that expose bone should be treated for osteomyelitis. Diabetic patients with foot ulcers that do not expose bone should undergo leukocyte scanning  which eliminates the risk of bone biopsy in diagnosing osteomyelitis and allows for the diagnosis and treatment of this well-known but often silent precursor of lower extremity amputation.,0,Unsuspected osteomyelitis in diabetic foot ulcers.

482,8655,Prediction of respiratory decompensation in Covid-19 patients using machine learning: The READY trial,"BACKGROUND: Currently, physicians are limited in their ability to provide an accurate prognosis for COVID-19 positive patients. Existing scoring systems have been ineffective for identifying patient decompensation. Machine learning (ML) may offer an alternative strategy. A prospectively validated method to predict the need for ventilation in COVID-19 patients is essential to help triage patients, allocate resources, and prevent emergency intubations and their associated risks. METHODS: In a multicenter clinical trial, we evaluated the performance of a machine learning algorithm for prediction of invasive mechanical ventilation of COVID-19 patients within 24 h of an initial encounter. We enrolled patients with a COVID-19 diagnosis who were admitted to five United States health systems between March 24 and May 4, 2020. RESULTS: 197 patients were enrolled in the REspirAtory Decompensation and model for the triage of covid-19 patients: a prospective studY (READY) clinical trial. The algorithm had a higher diagnostic odds ratio (DOR, 12.58) for predicting ventilation than a comparator early warning system, the Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS). The algorithm also achieved significantly higher sensitivity (0.90) than MEWS, which achieved a sensitivity of 0.78, while maintaining a higher specificity (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In the first clinical trial of a machine learning algorithm for ventilation needs among COVID-19 patients, the algorithm demonstrated accurate prediction of the need for mechanical ventilation within 24 h.

490,17982,Distinct cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-beta peptide signatures in cognitive decline associated with Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia.,Mild alterations in cognitive function are present in normal aging and severe cognitive alterations are a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Cognitive deficits are prevalent in patients with schizophrenia (SCZ) and worsen with old age. We recently reported that elderly SCZ patients show reduced levels of amyloid-beta (Aﾎｲ)1-42 in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). To further clarify the role of Aﾎｲ in cognitive decline  we analyzed the whole panel of CSF Aﾎｲ isoforms in elderly SCZ patients as well as in sporadic AD using SELDI TOF MS. The immunoproteomic study revealed  in all analyzed CSF samples  the presence of 15 different Aﾎｲ peptides. In CSF from SCZ  we detected an overall strong reduction of almost all Aﾎｲ species while in sporadic AD Aﾎｲ1-42 was the only peptide reduced. A significant independent association between Aﾎｲ1-40 levels and global cognition was found in SCZ. In addition  in SCZ patients  duration of therapy was positively associated with soluble amyloid precursor protein alpha levels  the total amount of CSF Aﾎｲ and the most abundant Aﾎｲ1-40 isoform. These data suggests a dysmetabolism of amyloid precursor protein in older SCZ patients. Thus  the quite comparable reduction of CSF Aﾎｲ1-42 in AD and in elderly SCZ patients reflects different pathophysiological dynamics in ageing brain.,0,Distinct cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-beta peptide signatures in cognitive decline associated with Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia.Mild alterations in cognitive function are present in normal aging and severe cognitive alterations are a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD).

METHODS: Population-based cohort study started with an examination of 809 men at age 55  followed by the first (age 68ys) and second follow up (age 82ys). 128 survivors were examined at age 82 with 99mTc-HMPAO-SPECT to estimate CBF  Zung-Self-Rating-Depression Scale (ZSDS)  and Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI). Analysis was performed on men free from stroke and dementia which defined the final study population to 120 subjects. RESULTS: ZSDS in the whole cohort ranged from 0.26 to 0.71 (reference 0.25-1.0). As the frequency of depressive symptoms was low  the case group (n窶=窶31) was defined by ZSDS index above 75th percentile (竕･0.48)  comprising 9 subjects with mild depression (ZSDS 0.55-0.71) and 22 subjects at 88th percentile and above of the normal range (ZSDS index 0.48-0.54). Cases were more often current smokers at age 68 (44% vs. 24%; p窶=窶.02) and had lower systolic blood presure (SBP)  lower social and physical activity  and suffered from fatigue  nausea  freezing and leg edema at age 82. Within the case group  ZSDS-index correlated negatively with CBF in subcortical area (r窶=窶-.42*)  left and right thalamus (r窶=窶-.40*  r窶=窶-.46**)  and right basal nuclei (r窶=窶-.35*).

495,59095,"Clinical Characteristics of COVID-19 in patients with pre-existing ILD: A retrospective study in a single center in Wuhan, China","BACKGROUND: Since the outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) pneumonia, many patients with underlying disease, such as interstitial lung disease (ILD), were admitted to Tongji hospital in Wuhan, China. To date, no data have ever been reported to reflect the clinical features of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) among these patients with pre-existing ILD. METHODS: We analyzed the incidence and severity of COVID-19 patients with ILD among 3201 COVID-19 inpatients, and compared two independent cohorts of COVID-19 patients with pre-existing ILD (n=28) and non-ILD COVID-19 patients (n=130). RESULTS: Among those 3201 COVID-19 inpatients, 28 of whom were COVID-19 with ILD (0.88%). Fever was the predominant symptom both in COVID-19 with ILD (81.54%) and non-ILD COVID-19 patients (72.22%). However, COVID-19 patients with ILD were more likely to have cough, sputum, fatigue, dyspnea, and diarrhea. Very significantly higher number of neutrophils, monocytes, IL-8, IL-10, IL-1beta and D-Dimer was characterized in COVID-19 with ILD as compared to those of non-ILD COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, logistic regression models showed neutrophils counts, pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL6, IL1beta, IL2R), and coagulation dysfunction biomarkers (D-Dimer, PT, Fbg) were significantly associated with the poor clinical outcomes of COVID-19. CONCLUSION: ILD patients could be less vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2. However, ILD patients tend to severity condition after being infected with SARS-CoV-2. The prognosis of COVID-19 patients with per-existing ILD is significantly worse than that of non-ILD patients. And more, aggravated inflammatory responses and coagulation dysfunction appear to be the critical mechanisms in the COVID-19 patients with ILD. This article is protected by copyright.

MATERIAL AND METHOD: The present study was a retrospective analysis of 412 pleural effusions from 373 patients that underwent ultrasound-guided small-bore catheter drainage in exudative pleural effusions between 2004 and 2009.  RESULTS: The two most common causes for drainage were parapneumonic effusion or empyema (52.2%) and malignant effusion (30.3%)  while the remains were trauma  iatrogenic  and others. Overall clinical success rate was 76.5%. The success rate was lower among malignant pleural effusion (p = 0.003). Causes of effusion were the only independent predictors related to success. Only five (1.2%) patients developed complication during the procedure. Seventy-five of 412 effusions (15.8%) developed complication during the period of drainage; the majority were drain blockage (9%) and accidental dislodgment (4.1%).

497,61800,The influence of right frontotemporal dysfunction on social behavior in frontotemporal dementia.,BACKGROUND: Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is associated with a variety of cognitive and behavioral dysfunctions. Symptoms may be influenced by the relative involvement of the right versus the left hemisphere  with left-sided FTD manifesting language changes and right-sided FTD presenting with aggressive  antisocial  and other socially undesirable behaviors. OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that right-sided FTD is associated with socially undesirable behavior. METHODS: The authors assessed 41 patients with FTD diagnosed by the new research criteria for FTD(1) including behavioral  neuropsychologic  and neurologic testing as well as SPECT and MRI. Based on visual inspection of SPECT scans  12 patients were classified as having predominantly right-sided and 19 patients were classified as having predominantly left-sided FTD. A clinician blinded to the imaging data reviewed medical records to tabulate the frequency of the following socially undesirable behaviors: criminal behavior  aggression  loss of job  alienation from family/friends  financial recklessness  sexually deviant behavior  and abnormal response to spousal crisis. RESULTS: Eleven of 12 right-sided and 2 of 19 left-sided FTD patients had socially undesirable behavior as an early presenting symptom (chi = 23.3  p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The authors conclude that right-sided frontotemporal degeneration is associated with socially undesirable behavior. The early presence of socially undesirable behavior in FTD differentiates right-sided from left-sided degeneration. The results highlight the importance of the right hemisphere  especially frontotemporal regions  in the mediation of social behavior.

498,3387,PET surveillance of patients with Ewing sarcomas of the trunk: Must the lower legs be included?,Aim: FDG-PET(/CT) is frequently used in surveillance of Ewing sarcoma (ES) patients. Since ES and PNET (primitive neuroectodermal tumours) may cause peripheral metastases some centers routinely recommend whole body PET acquisition from head to toe what may necessitate repositioning of the patient and thus extending examination time. It is not clear yet whether inclusion of lower leg adds to the diagnostic accuracy of PET scanning  especially in primary tumors of the trunk. Patients  method: 40 patients with ES and PNET of the trunk who were referred for surveillance after primary therapy with complete remission  were evaluated retrospectively: 27 men  13 women; mean age at diagnosis 16.3 (3-35) years. At the time of diagnosis 28 patients had localized and 12 metastatic disease. Almost all of the patients had undergone a combined chemotherapy with surgery or/and radiotherapy. 156 follow-up PET scans of the legs of these patients were evaluated retrospectively. Results: Only in three (1.9%) of 156 scans a pathologic FDG accumulation was attributed to metastatic disease of the lower extremities. In these cases the observation of metastatic disease in the legs did not alter therapy  since in all three cases a multifocal disease progression was observed. Conclusion: Scanning of the lower legs may be omitted during follow-up in patients in whom the primary tumor was located in the trunk and in whom no clinical signs pointing to metastases in the lower legs are present. This provides a sufficient diagnostic power and a shorter examination time  thus increasing patient comfort and scanner availability. © Schattauer 2010.,0,PET surveillance of patients with Ewing sarcomas of the trunk: Must the lower legs be included?Aim: FDG-PET(/CT) is frequently used in surveillance of Ewing sarcoma (ES) patients.

By the age of 40 years  virtually all adults with DS have sufficient neuropathology for a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD)  which is characterized by accumulation of amyloid-beta in senile plaques and formation of neurofibrillary tangles. Amyloid-beta derives from a longer precursor protein  APP  whose gene maps to chromosome 21. In DS  the early appearance of senile plaques is commonly associated with the presence of a third copy of the APP gene.
