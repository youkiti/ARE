Many vasopressors have been used for prevention of post-spinal hypotension (PSH) during CD; however, the optimum protocol for prophylaxis is not established yet. Phenylephrine \\n(PE) is a popular vasopressor used in obstetric anesthesia; however, its use is limited by its marked cardiac depressant nature. Norepinephrine (NE) is a potent vasopressor characterized by both \\u03b1 adrenergic agonistic activity in addition to a weak \\u03b2 adrenergic agonistic activity; thus, NE is considered a vasopressor with minimal cardiac depressant effect; these pharmacological properties would make NE an attractive alternative to PE. In this study, the investigators will compare continuous variable infusion of both drugs (PE and NE) with doses of 0.75 mcg/Kg/min and 0.05 mcg/Kg/min respectively for prophylaxis against PSH during CD. We used Norepinephrine Bitartrate 8 mg ampules which contains norepinephrine base of 4 mg. \\nStudy Type * \\nInterventional \\nICMJE \\nStudy Phase * \\nICMJE \\nPhase 4 \\nStudy Design *\\u00a7 \\nICMJE \\nAllocation \\nRandomized \\nInterventional Model \\nParallel Assignment \\nMasking \\nTriple (Participant, Care Provider, Outcomes Assessor) \\nPrimary Purpose \\nPrevention \\nCondition * \\nICMJE \\nCesarean Section Complications \\nSpinal Anesthesia \\nIntervention * \\nICMJE \\nDrug: Phenylephrine \\nPhenylephrine variable infusion with a starting rate of 0.75 mcg/Kg/min. \\nDrug: Norepinephrine \\nNorepinephrine bitartrate variable infusion with a starting rate of 0.1 mcg/Kg/min (equivalent to norepinephrine base of 0.05 mcg/Kg/min).

This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-ND license (http://\\nIntroduction \\nSeveral studies have demonstrated that vasopressors --- agonists are still the most reliable drugs for managing hypotension after spinal anesthesia during cesarean section.1--3 Currently(<>), phenylephrine is the vasopressor of choice in the prevention and treatment of hypotension induced by spinal anesthesia, due to its pure agonistic effect.4 However, the drug can cause bradycardia and reduced Cardiac Output (CO), even at clinically effective doses.2.3 \\nNorepinephrine maintains blood pressure as effectively as phenylephrine and preserves Heart Rate (HR) and CO within normal limits as it also has additive effects.5However, norepinephrine may have a sli(<>)ght effect on CO and HR, as it increases afterload through stimulation of --1 receptors, causing reflex bradycardia.6Therefore, the drug has been recommended in the treatme(<>)nt of hypotension induced by spinal anesthesia during cesarean section. Similarly, in North America, norepinephrine, ephedrine, and epinephrine have also been recommended as first-line vasopressors for the treatment of hypotension after \\ny.\\nspinal anesthesia during cesarean deliver7Furthermore, in a statement present in international consensus guidelines, epinephrine was recommended only for circulatory collapse.4 \\nIndeed, in the obstetric setting, epinephrine is a medication used less frequently by anesthesiologists in the prophylaxis and treatment of hypotension after spinal anesthesia during cesarean section. In the literature, there is only one study comparing the effect of epinephrine with phenylephrine in the treatment of hypotension after spinal anesthesia with hyperbaric tetracaine.8 \\nensi\\nAlthough some studies have compared the effect of phenylephrine and norepinephrine in the treatment of post-spinal anesthesia hypoton,5.9There is little evidence on the effect of epinephrine in the treatment of hypotension after spinal anesthesia and comparisons with other vasopressors. However, debates and studies determining the best vasopressors for prevention and treatment of post-spinal hypotension during cesarean section are still ongoing. \\nOur hypothesis was that epinephrine would be more effective than norepinephrine and phenylephrine in treating post-spinal hypotension during cesarean section. Like this, \\nthe primary outcome of this study was the incidence of intraoperative maternal hypotension, and the secondary outcomes were total ephedrine consumption and maternal and neonatal outcomes. \\nMethod \\nThis study was approved by the University Institutional Review Board (IRB decision number; 64/6). Written informed consent was obtained from all participants. The study was registered before patient recruitment in the clinicaltrials.gov( NCT03163914) and carried out between July 2017 and March 2018. \\nStudy protocol \\nThis prospective, double-blind, randomized, controlled, phase IV study was conducted to compare the effect of epinephrine with norepinephrine and phenylephrine in the treatment of post-spinal anesthesia hypotension and the need for ephedrine during cesarean delivery. After obtaining written informed consent from the patient, 160 patients with American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status I \\u2212 II were recruited. Patients aged between 18 and 42 years were selected for elective cesarean section under spinal anesthesia. Exclusion criteria were the presence of respiratory, hepatic, renal or cardiovascular disease, patients with a Body Mass Index (BMI) > 45 kg.m-two and any contraindication to regional anesthesia. A fasting period of 6 \\u2212 8 hours was respected and premedication was not administered before surgery. An 18G venous catheter was installed in the upper limb. \\nMonitoring and measurements \\nAll patients were monitored with Non-Invasive Blood Pressure (NIBP), Electrocardiogram (ECG) and Peripheral Oxygen Saturation (SpO2). Upon arrival at the operating room, patients were positioned in the supine position with left lateral inclination. HR and Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) were measured three times, and the mean HR and SBP were accepted as baseline values. SBP, Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP), Mean Blood Pressure (MAP), and HR were measured preoperatively and at 1-minute intervals for 15 minutes and then at 2.5-minute intervals until the end of surgery. \\nSpinal anesthesia \\nSpinal anesthesia was performed in all participants by administering a combination of hyperbaric bupivacaine (10 mg) and fentanyl (20 g). The drugs were injected with the patients in a sitting position using a 25G pencil tip bevel needle, through the L3 \\u2212 L4 or L4 \\u2212 L5 intervertebral space. Immediately after spinal anesthesia injection, the patient was positioned in the supine position and left lateral inclination of 15\\u25e6\\u221220\\u25e6and study medications were started. Oxygen was not administered unless the SpO2 value was less than 94%. The maximum height of the sensory block was assessed by a \\ninvestigator every 3 minutes, until the same dermatome level was confirmed in three consecutive assessments. This dermatome was accepted as the maximum height of the sensory block. Surgery was started when the sensory block was above the T5 dermatome. The investigator was blinded to agent/study group allocation. \\nRandomization \\nPatients were allocated to one of four study groups using a computer-generated sequence of permuted blocks of eight. Four syringes were prepared by an investigator blinded to the study groups, and were marked only with a coded label to preserve the double-blind nature of the study. The medications were diluted in 5% dextrose solution in syringes with a capacity of 50 mL, which were labeled as ''study medication'' and contained a volume of 30 mL. The syringes were identical and contained 150 g of norepinephrine (5 g.mL-1), 150 -g of epinephrine (5 -g.mL-1), 3 mg of phenylephrine (100 -g.mL-1) and the same volume of saline solution (30 mL). \\nStudy design \\nIn accordance with the study protocol and randomization procedures, 5-g.mL solutions-1of norepinephrine (norepinephrine group), 5 -g.mL-1of epinephrine (epinephrine group), 100 -g.mL-1of phenylephrine (phenylephrine group) and 0.9% NaCl solution (saline group) were infused immediately after induction of spinal anesthesia. All study medications were infused at a fixed rate of 30 mL.h-1maintained until the end of surgery. Rapid iv cohydration was administered using Lactated Ringer's (RL) solution, with the roller clamp fully open to a maximum of 2 L, after which the infusion was reduced to a slow maintenance rate. \\nA SBP value lower than 80% of the baseline (prenatal) SBP was considered hypotension. When SBP fell to <80% of baseline, 5 mg of ephedrine iv was administered as a rescue vasopressor, regardless of group. The incidence of hypotension, the total number of episodes of hypotension during surgery (the magnitude of hypotension), the number of patients who required ephedrine, the average amount of ephedrine and atropine consumed, and adverse effects such as bradycardia and hypertension. Bradycardia was defined as a HR < 60 beats.min-1and was corrected with a dose of 0.5 mg atropine sulfate iv bolus. Hypertension, considered SBP > 120% of baseline, was treated by stopping vasopressor infusion. Study drug infusion was restarted when SBP decreased below the maximum level of the target range (< 80% of baseline SBP). \\nData collection \\nTwo researchers participated as anesthesia provider and data collector. The first investigator, responsible for the case, performed spinal anesthesia, administered agents \\nand study fluids, supervised the patients, and recorded the maximum height of the sensory block. The other investigator, blinded to study medications, recorded hemodynamic parameters, ephedrine consumption, and adverse effects. \\nParticipants' demographic data (age, height and weight), birth characteristics (parity, BMI and indication for cesarean section) and duration of surgery were collected. The time from intrathecal injection of local anesthetic + fentanyl to skin incision and the time from skin incision to fetal delivery were calculated and recorded. The newly - newborns were evaluated by a pediatrician after birth, and Apgar scores were recorded in the first and fifth minutes. Fetal blood samples were collected from the umbilical cord vein to measure umbilical blood gases. All blood gas samples were measured immediately using an ABL800 FlexQ device (XLab solution, Denmark). \\nPost-operative recovery \\nPatients were transported to the Post-Anesthetic Care Unit (PACU) for follow-up after surgery. In the PACU, hemodynamic variables, regression of motor and sensory blockade and adverse effects were evaluated. Discharge criteria were stable vital signs, complete reversal of motor blockade and adequate analgesia (verbal pain scores < 4), absence of nausea, vomiting and pruritus. \\nStudy power analysis \\n10\\n10\\nDetermination of study power was based on the study by Tsen et al. carried out in a similar clinical situation.(<>)Using data from that study, the primary objective of the present study was the incidence of intraoperative maternal hypotension. We determined that 38 patients would be needed in each group to determine a 35% difference in the incidence of hypotension between the saline group (incidence of hypotension: 70%)(<>)and the vasopressor groups (incidence of hypotension of 35% expected in each group) ( = 0.1; - = 0.05; 0.35:0.35:0.35:0.70). Nevertheless, to compensate for losses and improve statistical power, 40 patients were recruited for each group. \\nStatistical analysis \\nCategorical variables are described in absolute numbers and percentages, while continuous variables are expressed as mean and standard deviation. The chi test - square was chosen to compare categorical variables between groups. The normality of the distribution of continuous variables was confirmed by the Shapiro-Wilk test. For group comparisons, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) or the Kruskal-Wallis test was chosen, depending on the fulfillment of statistical hypotheses. For normally distributed data regarding homogeneity of variances, the Tukey or Games & Howell tests were used for multiple group comparisons. For non-normally distributed data, the U test \\nBonferroni-corrected Mann-Whitney score was used for multigroup comparisons. A value of P<0.05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical analyzes were performed using the statistical software package IBM SPSS Statistics Version 20.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA, released 2011). \\nResults \\nWe included 160 patients and the entire study protocol was complet(<>)ed (fig. 1). Demographic data (age, weight and height), birth characteristics (BMI, parity and indication for cesarean section) and duration of surgery are described (<>)intable (<>)1. The maximum level of sensory block, the time between intrathecal injection and skin incision, and the time between skin incision and fetal extraction were similar (table 2(<>)). \\nThe hemodynamic variables of SBP in the perioperative period are shown infigur(<>)e 2. Throughout the study, transient decreases and increases in blood pressure values   were observed. These variables (SBP, DBP, and MAP) were similar between groups, suggesting that SBP was maintained by study medications and/or ephedrine at baseline levels. \\nThe incidences of hypotension are shown intable 3. Th(<>)ere (<>)were no statistically significant differences in the incidence of intraoperative maternal hypotension between the groups ( P= 0.625). Twenty-eight (70%) participants in the norepinephrine group, 29 (72.5%) in the epinephrine group, 27 (67.5%) in the phenylephrine group versus32 (80%) participants in the saline group experienced one or more episodes of hypotension. Only 17 (42.5%) participants in the norepinephrine group, 18 (45%) in the epinephrine group, 9 (22.5%) in the phenylephrine group, and 26 (65%) participants in the saline group required rescue ephedrine for correction. of hypotension associated with spinal anesthesia. There was a significant difference between the saline solution and phenylephrine groups in terms of the number of participants who required ephedrine ( P=0.001). However, there was no significant difference between the phenylephrine, norepinephrine and epinephrine groups. \\nThe mean number of hypotension episodes during anesthesia is shown in table 3. There were no statistically significant differences in the number of hypotension episodes between the groups (fig. 3). The a(<>)verage consumption of ephedrine was significantly higher in the saline solution group compared to the norepinephrine, epinephrine and phenylephrine groups ( P=0.001) Although the phenylephrine group consumed less ephedrine when compared to the other groups, there were no significant differences between the phenylephrine, norepinephrine and epinephrine groups. \\nThere was no statistically significant difference in the incidence of bradycardia and mean atropine consumption between the grou(<>)ps (table (<>)3). The average consumption of norepinephrine, epinephrine and phenylephrine in the groups during anesthesia was 78.6\\u00b113.7 -g, 87\\u00b114.2 -ge 1487\\u00b1249 -g, respectively. \\n(table 3\\nApgar scores and umbilical venous blood gas analysis are shown in Table 2.

The saline group consumed significantly more ephedrine when compared to the vasopressor groups, suggesting that hypotension was significantly more pronounced in this group. \\nAlthough structurally analogous, epinephrine and norepinephrine exert different effects in terms of their affinities for adrenergic receptor subtypes. Norepinephrine acts mainly by stimulating -receptors, but also has a weak adrenergic effect.5Epinephrine interacts with the same recept(<>)ors as norepinephrine, but has a greater affinity for the receptors - e when compared to norepinephrine.11 Phenylephrine is an agonist \\npharmacological nephrin and epi \\nhave theoretical advantages of additional beta effects when compared to phenylephrine. \\nTo establish placental perfusion and oxygen delivery to the fetus during spinal anesthesia, effective management of hypotension is essential. Studies have shown that placental perfusion and oxygen delivery to the fetus are mainly related to maternal CO and HR rather than SBP.5.12 Preliminary studies compa(<>)ring norepinephrine with phenylephrine have shown that norepinephrine better preserves placental blood flow compared to phenylephrine. 5.13In 2015, Nagn Kee et al. sug(<>)gested that this finding was mainly attributed to the additional -adrenergic effects of norepinephrine.5However, the same group in a previou(<>)s study reported that combinations of ephedrine and phenylephrine were superior to phenylephrine alone.14In the present study, the observatio(<>)n in the phenylephrine group of fewer patients requiring ephedrine administration and lower consumption of \\na vasopress \\nFigure 2 Systolic blood pressure in the groups.

However, the same authors in a more recent study revised the power ratio to 13.1:1.9 \\nwi\\nThere are few studies evaluating the effectiveness of epinephrine in treating hypotension during regional anesthesia.(<>)8.16 Brooker et al. compared the effect of epinephrine with phenylephrine in the treatment of hypotension after hyperbaric spinal anesthesia th tetracaine.8In their study, patients received bolus and infusion doses of epinephrine or phenylephrine in a 10:1 ratio. In our study, we chose a potency ratio of 1:1:20 for epinephrine norepinephrine phenylephrine, respectively. Notwithstanding these discrepancies, further dose-finding studies are needed to identify the exact potency ratios between these medications. \\nVasopressors administered prophylactically with a constant infusion rate reduce the severity and incidence of maternal hypotension. Results obtained in a study to determine doses suggested that the range for initial doses between 25 and 50 -g.min-1may be preferable for prophylactic phenylephrine infusions when compared to the initial infusion range between 75 and 100 -g.min-1.17Therefore, in the prese(<>)nt study, we used phenylephrine infusion doses of 50 -g.min-1(3 mg.hour-1). Epinephrine and norepinephrine infusion rates have also been established for \\n2.5 -g.min-1, obeying the potency ratio of phenylephrine. Different concentrations or relative doses should be explored in other studies. \\nWe found no significant difference between the four groups for the incidence of post-spinal anesthesia hypotension. However, ephedrine consumption was significantly higher in the saline solution group than in the vasopressor groups. The greater consumption of ephedrine was attributed to the more profound magnitude of post-spinal anesthesia hypotension in this group. Therefore, this study supports the concept that ephedrine consumption may not always be related to the incidence of post-spinal anesthesia hypotension. \\nPatients in all groups consumed more atropine than usual; possibly because we define bradycardia as HR less than 60 beats.min-1 instead of 50 beats.min-1. Furthermore, participants in the epinephrine group required less atropine compared to participants in the other vasopressor groups, possibly due to the potent effect 1 and less reflex bradycardia of this vasopressor. \\nAlthough the safety of any proposed new vasopressor is always a concern, this study evaluated the safety of epinephrine infusion using fetal umbilical blood gases and Apgar scores. Base excess and pH values   from gas analyzes in umbilical venous blood were significantly lower in the saline solution group than in the vasopressor groups. The lower BE and umbilical venous pH values   in the saline solution group may be related to the decrease in uteroplacental oxygen supply, when compared to the vasopressor groups. Low et al. stated that Ph < 7.1 and BE less than -12 mEq.L-1may be a cause for concern.18In our study, pH and BE values   were significantly higher than values \\nclinically critical in all groups (pH > 7.1 and BE > - 12 mEq.L-1 ). \\nolam\\nOur study has some limitations. First, we found no significant differences between the four groups for the incidence of post-spinal anesthesia hypotension. If we increased the number of patients or the doses of vasopressors, we could find a significant difference between the saline solution and vasopressor groups. Second, we did not measure CO changes during drug infusions because we did not have access to a CO monitor. Studies evaluating the CO response associated with phenylephrine have shown that CO changes occur in parallel with HR changes.1,19,20In our study, HR changes were similar (<>)between groups. Finally, we did not evaluate catecholamine safety metrics. The neonatal safety profiles of maternal catecholamines in pregnancy are potentially concerning, however, catecholamines do not cross the placenta in appreciable quantities, thanks to the metabolization of catecholamines in the placenta.21.22Furthermore, data from human studies on the fetal effects of catechines are encouraging.21 \\nIn conclusion, there were no statistically significant differences in the incidences of hypotension and ephedrine consumption during spinal anesthesia for cesarean section with epinephrine, when compared to norepinephrine or phenylephrine. Epinephrine can be considered as an alternative agent for the treatment of post-spinal anesthesia hypotension. Additional, larger studies are needed to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of epinephrine. \\nInterest conflicts \\nThe authors declare no conflicts of interest \\nReferences \\n1.\\nH(<http://refhub.elsevier.com/S0034-7094(20)30402-5/sbref0115>)abib A(<http://refhub.elsevier.com/S0034-7094(20)30402-5/sbref0115>)S.

Wong, MD \\n1 \\n2 \\n3 \\n4 \\n5 \\n2\\n5 \\n6 \\n7 \\n6 \\nS pinal anesthesia (using cocaine) was first described by August Bier in 1899 in Germany, and the first cesarean delivery with spinal anesthesia was likely performed in North American in 1901or 1902.However, early after its introduction to surgical anesthesia, hypotension was recognized as a significant clinical problem.The \\u201cdanger\\u201d of spinal anesthesia was summarized by Frankenin a 1934 observational study of 2088 spinal anesthetics performed for cesarean de-livery\\u2014he reported 1 death for every 139 procedures, which even in 1934 was considered unacceptably high. The use of spinal anesthesia in obstetrics likely peaked in the United States in the 1950s when it was used for both vaginal and cesarean delivery anesthesia.By the early 1960s, methods of continuous epidural anesthesia were being introduced, and spinal anesthesia in obstetrics fell out of favor because of its high incidence of adverse maternal effects, including hypo-tension, inability to prolong anesthesia and analgesia, and postdural puncture (\\u201cspinal\\u201d) headache.,However, starting in the early 1990s, spinal anesthesia experienced a resurgence in obstetrical anesthesia practice. New small-bore, disposable, pencil-point spinal needles significantly decreased the incidence of spinal headache, new drugs were available, and clinicians had a better appreciation of the hemodynamic consequences of spinal anesthesia. Maternal death was reported in both generaland epiduralanesthesia, and by the late 1990s, it was well recognized that general anesthesia was associated with a higher anesthesia-related maternal mortality rate than neuraxial (spinal or epidural) anesthesia.\\n8 \\nAnesthesiologists have long recognized that uteroplacental perfusion is not autoregulated and is therefore directly dependent on maternal blood pressure. Because of the resurgence of spinal anesthesia in the past several decades, there has been an explosion of research on the prevention and treatment of spinal anesthesia-induced hypotension. In the current issue of the American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology, Knigin et alreported the results of a single-center, retrospective observational study (data are from 2007 to 2017) in which they investigated factors associated with \\nFrom the Department of Anesthesia, University of Iowa Carver College of Medicine, Iowa City, IA. \\nReceived Aug. 20, 2020; accepted Aug. 26, 2020. \\nThe author reports no conflict of interest. \\nCorresponding author: Cynthia A.

Sustained hypoten-sion and a prolonged anesthesia-to-delivery interval were both associated with fetal acidosis (overall incidence, 2.6%). \\n9 \\n10 \\n11 \\nThe finding of an association between hypotension and fetal acidosis is not new or surprising. Crawford recognized as early as 1966 that spinal anesthesia was associated with a greater degree of fetal acidosis than general anesthesia.Depending on the definition of hypotension (and how one defines \\u201cbaseline\\u201d), the incidence of hypotension in women undergoing cesarean delivery with spinal anesthesia reaches 100%.Helpfully, the advent of noninvasive cardiac output monitoring in the past 2 decades has allowed more nuanced assessment of the cardiovascular changes associated with midthoracic spinal anesthesia. It is now well understood that the primary mechanism of hypotension is a profound decrease in systemic vascular resistance owing to dilation of the arteriolar resistance vessels.A compensatory increase in cardiac output and heart rate is the result. \\n12 \\n13 \\n14 \\nAlong with a better understanding of the hemodynamic changes associated with spinal anesthesia, the last 2 decades has brought a sea change in the prevention and treatment of spinal hypotension. Historically, ephedrine, an indirect-acting drug with both alpha-and beta-adrenergic agonist effects, was the vasopressor of choice. Initial studies performed in the 1970s in instrumented gravid ewes suggested that ephedrine maintained uterine blood flow, whereas direct alpha-adrenergic agonists decreased flow.Subsequently however, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in humans comparing ephedrine with phenylephrine (a direct-acting alpha-adrenergic agonist) showed that neonates whose mothers received phenylephrine had higher umbilical artery pH and lower base deficitthanneonateswhose mothers received ephedrine, although both drugs successfully treated hypotension.Further study showed that ephedrine crosses the placenta at a higher rate and undergoes less early metabolism or redistribution in the fetus than phenylephrine.Associated increases in umbilical artery lactate and pCO2 suggest that the mechanism of fetal acidosis associated with ephedrine may be because of ephedrine stimulation of fetal metabolism. \\n15 \\nSpinal anesthesia-induced hypotension in the setting of cesarean delivery has been variably defined, but most studies have used the definition of a 20% or 30% decrease in baseline systolic blood pressure or systolic blood pressure of <100 mm Hg,and anesthesiologists have used these thresholds to determine when to treat hypotension. However, further study has suggested that maternal and neonatal outcomes are better if maternal blood pressure is maintained close to the baseline. \\n16 \\n17 \\nIn a RCT using phenylephrine, the management strategy of treating blood pressure whenever it dropped below baseline was compared to the strategy of treating blood pressure whenever it dropped below 80% of baseline. Umbilical artery pH was higher, and the incidence of maternal nausea and vomiting was lower in women whose blood pressure was maintained near baseline.This study, along with others, supports the practice of preventing hypotension with prophylactic phenylephrine administration rather than waiting for the inevitable hypotension to occur and then treating it.\\n18 \\n19 \\nIntravenous fluid loading before the induction of spinal anesthesia (\\u201cpreload\\u201d) has been traditionally done to \\u201cfill the tank\\u201d made functionally empty by sympathetic blockade and acute vasodilation. Studies in the past several decades have demonstrated the flaw in this practice\\u2014the intravascular dwell time of crystalloid administered to a euvolemic patient (before the induction of anesthesia) is measured in minutes,and preloading has been shown to be minimally effective. However, fluid administration is not without merit. In a trial in which patients were randomized to receive a phenylephrine infusion only or a phenylephrine infusion with a rapid fluid bolus initiated at the induction of spinal anesthesia (termed \\u201ccoloading\\u201d), the incidence of hypotension was virtually zero in the phenylephrine with fluid coload group compared with a 28% incidence of hypotension in patients in the phenylephrine-only group.Thus, in any study of spinal hypotension, fluid management should be standardized or at least reported (timing, volume, and rate of administration). \\n15 \\n8 \\n8 \\nWhere do we currently stand with blood pressure management? International consensus guidelines published in 2018 suggest that a vasopressor with potent alpha-adrenergic agonist activity should be used prophylactically to prevent hypotension with the aim of maintaining systolic blood pressure \\ue00390% of baseline.This is most easily accomplished with a titrated infusion (rather than bolus administration) of vasopressor and rapid intravenous administration of crystalloid (approximately 1 L) at the time of induction of anesthesia accompanied by frequent (every 1 minute) blood pressure measurements. Notably, no component of this management regime was used in the study by Knigin et al,alone or in combination. It is interesting to note that in patients whose hypotension was treated with phenylephrine, there was no association with neonatal acidosis (95% con\\ufb01-dence interval of odds ratio included 1).\\n8 \\n20 \\n8 \\n8 \\nIn addition to the unsurprising finding that the extent and duration of predelivery maternal hypotension were associated with neonatal acidosis, Knigin et alreported that the anesthesia-delivery time interval was independently associated with acidosis. This association has also been reported by others.Although investigators have suggested that this interval is potentially modifiable and shortening the interval may result in less neonatal acidosis, the question still remains as to the etiology of this association and whether prolonged (even mild) hypotension played a role in the study results.There are hard stops on the degree to which this interval is modifiable, and the intervals described in the Knigin et al\\nstudy were not long (median anesthesia-to-delivery interval, 15 minutes; 90th percentile, 24 minutes). To my knowledge, no study has investigated this association in the setting of optimal blood pressure management (as described earlier). \\n21 \\n22 \\nOther questions regarding the management of spinal hy-potension are currently being investigated. Almost all studies to date have included healthy, nonlaboring women undergoing planned cesarean delivery. We need to have a better understanding of whether the hemodynamic management goals differ for patients with comorbidities, including those with reduced placental reserve or those undergoing intrapartum delivery.Historically, systolic blood pressure has been used because it was easier to measure, but organ perfusion depends on mean arterial blood pressure, begging the question of whether we should focus blood pressure management on mean or on systolic blood pressure. Recently, norepinephrine has been proposed as an ideal vasopressor, as it may be associated with less maternal bradycardia than phenylephrine.\\n8 \\n8 \\n16 \\n23 \\n8 \\n20 \\nShould the results of the Knigin et alstudy change our current preference for neuraxial anesthesia for cesarean delivery? The answer is definitively \\u201cno,\\u201d although anesthesiologists should pay meticulous attention to blood pressure management. The findings of Knigin et albear confirmation in the modern era of blood pressure management. Small studies suggest that the incidence of neonatal acidosis is very low if blood pressure is maintained near the baseline.Accepting that spinal hypotension causes lower umbilical artery pH, we also need to ask whether these differences are worth fussing about in the context of other risks and benefits of alternative anesthetic techniques. Some cases of spinal hy-potension are evitable unless we aim to maintain blood pressure higher than the baseline. The association between neonatal metabolic acidemia and longer-term complications (eg, neonatal encephalopathy, cerebral palsy) is weak.The finding in the Knigin et alstudy and othersthat secondary neonatal outcomes (eg, low Apgar scores, transient tachypnea of the newborn, respiratory distress syndrome, intensive care unit admission) are not associated with hypotension suggests that a low incidence of isolated fetal acidosis may be low on our list of concerns. Our normal practice should be to induce spinal anesthesia and perform the necessary preparation (eg, urinary catheter insertion, skin decontamination, draping, time-out) efficiently and safely. We should not waste time, but neither should we rush and leave out important steps unless future research identifies a modifiable step that results in improved neonatal outcome without increased risk to the mother. Until these questions are answered and new findings suggest otherwise, we should not change current management. \\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS \\nThe author thanks Alexander J.
